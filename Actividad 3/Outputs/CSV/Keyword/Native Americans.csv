Vermont Kentucky Indiana and The Western Territory. About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky ten years ago lay in forest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has been the population that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants already in each of these states. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year in 1789 and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States published in America in May last we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them called The Western Territory ; and it must rerejoice the heart of every Briton to read it and think that the settling of these countries though the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 20 years will long keep them from manufacturing and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman even though wages are very high when he can for twenty pounds purchase a thousand acres of land that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect that new channels of commerce will be opened and the inland parts of the Continent will require an increasing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation will be diffused through a country more fertile more extensive than all the Thirteen United States. The Western Territory Is the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river –north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania? south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains according to Mr. Hutchins Geographer General to the Congress 411000 square miles equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres from which he deducts forth-three millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hundred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the fed–ral government which is to be sold for the discharge of the debt owing to the United States. But a very small proportion of these lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*. On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements are already commenced–one at Marietta the other at Miami. This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787 and already contains above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi Ohio Muskingham Hockhocking Sioto Miami Wobash&c–Coal and iron mines and salt pits abound in this State; the soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy pleasant and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States. The timber is tall and in great variety?Streams for mills abound here. Wheat indigo hemp and cotton thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties and fulfill the description of travellers who call it the garden of the world. It is here probably also that the center of a great empire will be fixed in some future period. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accommodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with wild game of every kind; herds of deers elks bears &c fill the extensive meadows of thie country?turkies geese swans and partridges &c. are innumerable. The rivers are excellently stored with fish and almost all navigable for small sloops. In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30000 persons; and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States. Rejoice O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you and you only! * No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum.  ID23,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,10,09,inform,Albany Aug. 10. By a gentleman who arrived in this city on Friday last from the county of Ontario in the Genesee county (the territory lately ceded by this state to the commonwealth of Massachusetts) we are informed that four days before he left that county Colonel Brant from Niagara at the head of between 16 and 1800 of the principal Sachems and other Indians of the Six Nations had arrived at Conadoque the seat of Oliver Phelps Esq; on a visit of friendship and at the same time to receive the money due them for the lands sold to the company of Messrs. Gorham and Phelps–That they were met by Mr. Phelps and the principal inhabitants of Conadoque four miles from that place and conducted into town –That they were highly gratified with the treatment they received and with the manner in which they had disposed of their lands.–The gentleman further informs that there is now about 3000 inhabitants in the above county and that the land is of a good quality.  ID28,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,11,23,inform,Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Danville (Kentucky) to his friend in Baltimore It is with great concern I communicate to you the following truly melancholy intelligence: –About three weeks ago Mr. Richard Chenoweth had six or eight men allowed him by the officer of the garrison at the Falls to guard his exposed plantation in Bear Crab Settlement below the Falls. In the evening of their arrival before they had taken their station as a guard a number of Indians rushed into Mr. Chenoweth's house killed two of the soldiers and three of Mr. Chenoweth's children and tomahawked and scalped his wife leaving her on the floor for dead– Mr. Chenoweth (who had his arm broke by the savages) with the rest of the men made their escape.–There was one of Mr. Chenoweth's children sick in a chamber and it is reported she never heard any thing of the dreadful massacre; but next morning crawling down stairs she was inexpressibly shocked at the sight of a beloved parent almost breathless–Mr. Chenoweth returned next day to his house and carried his wife to a neighbouring plantation where they are both likely to recover and what is remarkable she wants to return to her own house.–The savages have been very troublesome in this neighbourhood. –A small company are gone to White River to extirpate 80 or 90 Indians who as spies have informed have upwards of 300 horses &c. at that place.  ID29,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,11,23,inform,Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Pittsburgh to his friend in Philadelphia dated Sept. 2. The Indians have killed six soldiers at the mouth of Little Sandy Creek below the Great Kanawa where the New Englanders were forming a settlement.  ID46,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,inform,Extract of a letter from Philadelphia Aug. 23. Congress is still sitting at New York and from the multiplicity of business before them there is no likelihood of the session's soon closing. We are curious to know what foreigners will say of our new commercial arrangements. Among ourselves there is but one opinion and that is faavourable. o our own vessels a preference is undoubtedly due; and among foreign vessels and merchandise there is no discrimination in our import and tonnage acts every nation being on the same footing. With respect to the duties themselves they could not be laid lower considering the demand of supplies which the Committee appointed to give in an estimate state at upwards of eight millions of dollars. Accustomed to disappointment in hopes of improvement in politics and commerce we feel a reluctance to entertaining very sanguine wishes. Yet appearances encourage the expecttion of the f–deral government's acting with the energy and effect that will give it respectability. The prejudices and animosities created by the late contest are gradually dying away ; and to the idleness and dissipation flowing from the same source industry has in a great degree succeeded. A progress has also been made in manufactures of various kinds that was not expected ; and the persevering in them affords a strong presumption of those concerned deriving advantage. Throughout the union the public opinion on matters of government has of late experienced rapid changes. Vice President Adams in his highly esteemed work has fully demonstrated the absurdity of democracy and the superior excellence of a mix form such as that of Britain. His deductions from premises admitted as just have abated much of the popular aversion to monarchy ; and as every thing matures quickly in our transatlantic soil it would not surprise many were United America to have a sovereign earin the next century. In no one instance has our new admnistration given general satisfaction more than in their conduct towards the Indians. The interests of those unfortunate people will be studiously attended to ; and they will be effectually protected against the lawless violence of the individuals or States who wished to wrest their lands from them. This determination is dictated by policy as well humanity ; for it is now become the interest of the States to check by every means short of violence the erratic disposition of their citizens who when removed to the wilds beyond the mountains cannot be regarded as of any value in a political view.  ID62,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,01,04,inform,October 31. We are informed by very respectable authority that Mr. M'Gillvry has written to the President of the United States a full and sensible account of the rise and progress of the disputes subsisting between the Georgians; from which statement he expected to prove to a demonstration that he has not acted the inconsistent part which some have alleged neither has there been such cruelties committed by the Indians. From Mr. M'Gillevry's abilities and considering he was educated in Europe being the son of a Scotchman and Indian women we have no reason to expect any savage cruelties from an of his people; but on the contrary it is rather to be presumed that his proposals which are contained in his letter to the President are of a rational nature and many probably bring about a final and an advantageous treaty with the United States.  ID68,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,07,09,inform,We have this day received Quebec newspapers down to the 24th May from which the following is extracted:– Quebec May 20. We hear late accounts from Niagara mention that the Indians in that quarter are much alarmed in consequence of a message said to be received by them from the States that they had now raised an army to take their own for Niagara and that two thousand men of that army were now on their way from New York–desiring the Indians to lye still and look on and that they would punish those that should interfere. It was also said that the people of New York were determined of themselves to lay open the post of Oswego and that emissaries had been employed to persuade the Indians they would be greatly benefited by that event. We are rather inclined to believe the Indians are too sensible of the great benefits already conferred upon them by our neighbours in buying their lands from them to think of accepting any more from that quarter and we would recommend it to the new-born Sovereignty on this side the Atlantic before they testify their impatience that national treaties like private agreements are not to be infringed by one and performed by the other party–Pay and you shall receive. [As to the Americans making an attempt upon Niagara they have long had it in contemplation to get possession of our posts upon the lakes in Canada.] May 24. The concerned in the ship Columbia and sloop Washington have received letters from the Captain Kendrick dated at Nootka in July last; he informs them that he passed the winter preceding on the north-west coast of America; that he was then bound on a voyage further northward and from thence intended to proceed to Canton.– The letters were forwarded to Mexico by a Spanish fleet that had been at Nootka and from thence to the Spanish Charge des Affaires at New York. They were covered to the President of the United States of America. [From what appeared in our paper of Friday last (see Glasgow Intelligence p. 424 ) and what is mentioned above it seems very probable that the affair of Nootka Sound had been a preconcerted scheme between the Americans and Spaniards as Capt. Kendrick addresses his dispatches for the President of the States without making the least mention (from what is made public) of any British ships being then at Nootka Sound.]  ID69,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,08,16,inform,By recent letters from America we learn that the Congress of the nited States after warm debates in both Houses particularly in that of the Representatives passed an act for the purpose of fixing permanently their seat of Government at German Town in Pennsylvania. The two new provinces in North America Kentucky and Vermont whose population already is so very considerable were formed by the vast numbers of inhabitants who fled from the destruction and ravages of the unhappy contest between Great Britain and her colonies and though the greatest part of them were then deemed loyalists yet they have now jooined the American confederation. Seated on the banks of the great river Mississippi far to the westward of all the other states they can either navigate northerly to the lakes or southerly to the Spanish settlements on the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and carry on a lucrative trade with the Indians. They are possessed of as fertile a tract of country as any in the world the position of which they??? also s???d by navigable rivers to Maryland Virginia and Pennsylvania and from thence as their views???tend to every country in Europe. Thus from the most distressed situation to rise to opulence and independence ina few years must excite admiration. Agriculture at present seems to be the peculiar province of American industry from whence wealth will flow into every part of that vast country as it abounds in large tracts of rich land level grounds with a deep soil and extended savannahs; while to the northward the fisheries and shipbuilding amply compensate for the want of an equal fertility; and though not so abundant in coin yet the provinces produce the finest meadows form whence a provision trade will be every year increasing. The southern countries of Europe not affording sufficient crops of grain for the support of their inhabitants on account of the remarkable encrease of population and which is still augmenting as arts and manufacturers are every where extended: America may therefore be deemed in future the granary of this quarter of the globe.  ID73,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,19,entertain,Court of Chancery. The King at the relation of the Bishop of London versus Anderson and Gipps. On the 18th of June 1692 the Hon. Mr. Boyle left by will the sum of 5400l. to be laid out in lands in Yorkshire out of the rents of which the sum of 90l. was to be paid annually to the College of William and Mary in New England to be applied for the purpose of propagating the Christian religion amongst the Indians in the back settlements in North America ; and likewise a further sum of 45l. to be paid to the same College for the support of two missionaries to preach the gospel. The city of London were left trustees and the management under the trust was by the will committed to the care of the Bishop of London. The present Bishop instituted this suit in which the city and a great number of other persons were parties for the single and indeed novel purpose of knowing whether (as the teststor had originally devised the several sums for the use of British subjects and the Americans having ceased to be in that situations since their independence) the annuity ought not to revert to this kingdom or to some other of his Majesty's colonies to be applied to similar purposes. This being the first determination of that nature since the American Revolution the Lord Chancellor decided it with that superior dignity of sentiment that always attends his decrees. Two phrases are sufficient– all charitable devices are to be held sacred– we cannot rake up the ashes of the dead in search of latent intentions. The annuities and arrears must be paid and Messrs. Anderson and Gipps and likewise the city of London must be paid their costs.  ID76,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,22,entertain,On Tuesday afternoon the six Cherokee Chiefs visited the Cathedral of St. Paul's which they explain with an equal degree of curiosity and amazement. They were asked whether they would not attend the evening service which they readily complied and seemed particularly delighted with the organ. The Cherokee Chiefs having made us an offer of 20000 men gratitude obliges us to make them some acknowledgement whether we accept their offer or not.–We can very well spare them the members of the Halter Club–all our housebreakers highwaymen pick pockets swindlers Faro and E O Table keepers–and all their accomplices to an amazing number. Such a collection would be a truly valuable present.–Among them are found dispersedly all the qualities of able Generals–skilful Financiers –able Negotiators active Citizens–and men highly expert at a Coup de Main. Were we to add the Pugilistic tribe–the Cherokee Chiefs might on their return to their own country enter into a boxing war against their enemies–with a certainty of the most brilliant success. Trading Justices and Lawyers they would perhaps be glad to have ; and it is the opinion of most people that a few thousands of the latter description of men might be spared.  ID80,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,26,inform,When the Cherokee Chiefs first visited Coventgarden Theatre one of them appeared much delighted with the splendid appearance of an Indian cap worn by one of the pantomime actors; this being observed the performer was directed the performance; the Chief amazed at the offer of the magnificent present said through his interpreter that even in his won country he should be unable to repay it ; however at present he would do the utmost in his power ; on this he ordered the actor to approach him and then lighting his Cherokee pipe stuffed with a variety of nauseous combustibles he too three whiffs himself and presenting the tube desired the actor to take three whiffs also–the greatest favour a Cherokee could confer ; the actor aastonished at the singularity of this unexpected honour reluctantly complied with the requestto the great entertainment of the Dramatic circle.  ID85,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,12,13,inform,THE INDIANS. IT is our wish in imitation of other newswritters to give now and then an account of such new publications as deserve the attention of the public; but in a paper published only twice a week where so much naturally occurs under the article of temporary news it is but seldom we can find room for this purpose:–when however any ting remarkable appears in the literary world we never fail to notice it although it may not be in our power to give an extensive and critical account of its excellencies. We take up the pen with real pleasure at present to announce the publication of a tragedy intitled THE INDIANS the reputed offspring of a learned Professor in this University. The great applause with which this play was received when performed at Richmond Theatre has raised the expectations of those who were not present at the performance to the highest pitch; and we think we may take upon ourselves to assert that upon perusing it even their highest expetations will not be disappointed.– The plot of the piece is taken from a well known story published at the end of a volum of poems written by the same gentleman. In the choice of a plot where so many dramatic writers of respectable talents have erred our author is peculiarly happy. He ha strictly observed the advice of Horace: Denique sit quid vis simplex dumtaxat et unum. It is simple and yet it does not disgust by an appearance of nakedness.–It is one for the complaints of Maraino and the return of Oniyo form a beginning; the machinations of Yerdal and Neidan to prevent their meeting a middle; and defeat of those arts an end which combined wake up a compleat and connected whole. In the delineation of character the author has on al every occasion attended to the quid quemque decent –there are hoever some few parts which the critic halts to consider but which amidst so many beauties he blushes to censure–Some lines for instance in the character of Ononthio do not strike us at first as strictly natural. Is so much humanity found inthe breast of an Inan Sachem as to prompt him to spare a victim about to be destroyed accoridng to the custom of the country; that victim a captive of war and not only so but a Briton who has been fighting against his countrymen amongst whom was his only son whom he bleived slain? Would he exert himself so much in favour of a stranger and a foe at the risk of displeasing the village and consequently of losing his power? Or is it likely that he would have greater influence with the superstitious crowd than he who was deemed of skill to bend to his purpose the demons that sway the fortune of mankind?–Another question concenring Ononthio and we leave him. Is it consistent with the philosophic firmness of the Sachem so to despair on receiving news of his son's death as to declare that he should know no comfort but to die? or is it consistent with his humanity to leave Maraino at such a period of distress when she most stood in need of his kind offices?–The first and best supported character in the piece is that of Maraino. Her mind seems intended as the seat of every amiable virtue. Her grateful reverence of Ononthio her unaffected piety and her humanity in interfering to save an unknown captive from death are pleasing??? which give??? an insight into her nature. In the breast of Mariano every thing is subordinate to her love for Onaiyo: this leading feature in her caracter is properly kept in view during the course of the piece. But even in this master-piece the author has perhaps once deviated a little from nature. The sentiments Maraino utters during the conversation with Sydney in the fifth act are rather those of a Phiosopher and Divine than a young creature the chorus of whole heart are tuned to the sweetest strains of tenderness and love. Can she who had lately discovered a long lost brother talk so coldly in his presence; Can she who had so lately heard of the safety of an adored-husband so entirely banish his image from her mind as to converse on matters so indifferent? Can the gentle Maraino become the cold moralist?–With this one exception the part of which we are speaking is finely drawn and highly interesting.–The language of the piece is every where elegant and in many places where the sentiment requires it sublime. The author has frequently dignified his verse by the introduction of obsolete words; this in general produces a good effect–but there is a danger of using them too often and of chusing them too ancient. it is a dangerous and difficult talk where all is so excellent to refer to any particular passage of scene as deserving most notice: it requires no small degree of taste and judgement. If there is any preference to be given it is perhaps to that scene in the 2d act where Onaiyo gives an account of the battle at Quebec; and the scene in the 4th act where Maraino is prompted by Neidan to slay her brother–who proves his innocence by the production of her husband's belt the sight of which draws an elegant speech from the enraptured fair. This scene however would be improved did it conclude with something more apt to the joyful moment than the solemn sounds of Ononthio: a speech excellent in itself and containing a very fine sentiment Sed nunc non erat his locus.– Upon the whole the tragedy upon which we have guided by impartiality spoken so freely is in our opinion far superior to most of those plays which have appeared of late years:–it is devoid of bombast:–it is nature–and she must inevitably please.  ID86,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,02,01,inform,Advice from Charlestown South Carolina says that the Indians in Washington county commit the most horrid depredations and cruelties. They have set fire to several houses; and a woman who had a sick husband telling them from a window of her calamity they shot her dead on the spot and then set fire to the spot. The sick man was consequently burnt. A Colonel Harling has greatly exerted and distinguished himself in opposing the Indians on a part of the American frontiers. This gentleman with two hundred men even went into the very heart of an Indian settlement and defeated the savages. He then penetrated the country destroying all before him and returned without the loss of a man. Every possible acknowledgement was made of his services and bravery and a liberal subscription made for his gallant little army.  ID87,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,05,23,inform,QUEBEC December 2 1790 Yesterday's post from Montreal conveyed letters to several gentlemen in town all corroboratiing the following extract. SIR I have to inform you by several letters received here on Saturday from Detroit we are informed the Americans under General Sinclair had been twice defeated about the 19th ult. with the loss of from 500 to 600 men by the Indians The Indians first attacked a body of 300 horse which they had drawn into a snare and cut the whole of them off. In a second engagement they were likewise victorious having nearly killed as many. On account of which Sinclair thought proper to retreat; and the last accounts state the Indians having divided themselves into small parties had so harrassed him that he was obliged to leave the wounded in the field–Sinclair lost his artillery a cohorn and grass-hopper. It is said the Indians are very much elated at their success and that numbers were daily joining them at their head quarters about the Maimis towns– One Indian it is said killed 30 with his own hand. The Indians were extremely civil to the traders from Detriot having assisted them when they knew of the approach of the Americans to remove their property to safety except ammunition and arms. These are facts so well ascertained that there does not remain the least doubt of them: They may be attended with very serious and important consequences to the province as I dare say all will be imputed to the British for supplying these Indians with arms and ammunition.– In short I would not be surprized to hear of an American army raising to attack this country. * The loss is here specified but other letters differing in number we shall only say the estimate in general does not appear considerable.  ID92,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,14,inform,As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at the opening of the Congress of the United States at New York Nov. 6 1792 gives an impartial account of the situation of tha country we are persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives IT is some abatement of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our western frontier have terminated: You will I am persuaded learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the further effusion of blood–to arrest the progress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable purposes:–In making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the event or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable; to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case. A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thus far will I trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them indeed is still depending; but a favorable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by anything that has yet happened. In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will I presume be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased. It must add to your concern to be informed that besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it. A part of the Cherokees known by the name of Chickamagas inhabiting five villages on the Tennessee River have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements. It was hoped that the treaty of Holston made with the Cherokee Nation in July 1791 would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter. The information which has been received on this subject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive precautions only have been enjoined and observed. It is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever on the part of the United States or their citizens is even alleged as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter. I have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete and pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable. In looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year. This however will be better ascertained in the course of the session; and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostilities. I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory–To enable by competent rewards the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable. The prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated–This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United States. These impediments have lessened and are lessened in local extent; and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the law appears to be progressive. But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters I judged a special interposition on my part proper and advisable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto. Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders. And Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend upon me shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws. In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of the Government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens. I can not forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the structure of the system which in some cases tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this subject provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the courts of the United States and a supplementary definition of offenses against the constitution and laws of the union and of the punishment for such offenses will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention. Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary. It would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your consideration of the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations and other infractions of the law of nations which furnishes just subject of complaint might endanger our peace with them. And in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose which takes place if not renewed at the close of the present session. In execution of the authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our mint; others have been employed at home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them. The regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage as being essential to their due operation and to order in our money concerns will I doubt not be resumed and completed. It is represented that some provisions in the law which establishes the Post-Office operate in experiment against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should this upon due enquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and infor mation will I doubt not lead to the application of a remedy. The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky has been notified to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order. It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for three millions of florins–one at Antwerp at the annual interest of four and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all charges.–The rates of these loans and the circumstances under which they have been made are confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad. Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives. I entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effec tual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the government –no measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation. Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made of the Bank of the United States pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made. Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and I doubt not will engage your early attention. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. I content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you. Various temporary laws will expire during the present session. Among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will merit particular notice. The results of your common deliberations hitherto will I trust be productive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents; such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment upon which under Divine Providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness. Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivation of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils.  ID94,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,07,22,inform,Philadelphia June 1. We are informed that in consequence of instructions from the Executive Council of the United States to the Attorney for the District of Penn sylvania prosecutions have been instituted against John Singleterry and Gideon Henfield charged with violating their duty as Citizens of the United States entering on board the armed schooner Genet in the service of France and with others on board the said schooner capturing several vessels the property of the subjects of his Britannic Majesty and otherwise annoying the trade and commerce of the said subjects contrary to the Laws of Nations and the Treaty of Peace subsisting between the United States and his said Britannic Majesty. The above named persons have been committed to the goal of the County of Philadelphia to take their trial at the next Circuit Court of the United States. A letter from Charleston dated May 10 says Yesterday evening a gentleman arrived here from Augusta in Georgia who informs that six of the Creek Towns with a number of Cherokees had declared war against the United States and were actually marching under the command of Bowles and Gilpin at attack the frontiers.  ID95,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,07,29,inform,A great number of white people and white families have been killed and scalped by the Indians in the back settlements of America. Among the killed and scalped is Mr. Pugh son of Colonel Pugh. The Indians are determined on war with the Americans. They are headed by Gilpin the successor of M'Gillivray and have already commenced hostilities on the back settlements of Carolina.  ID96,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,10,07,inform,Knoxville May 11. I T is shocking to describe the bloody scenes that have lately taken place in this district. The Indians have killed and scalped a great number of persons among whom is Colonel Isaac Bledose who was massacred within 150 yards of his own house. On the 27th instant a body of Indians attacked Greenfield station: they killed John Jervis and a negro fellow belonging to Mrs. Tarker. By the bravery of three young men viz. William Neely William Wilson and William Hall the station was preserved; they killed two Indians wounded several others and put them to flight. It is to be remembered that Neely and Hall had each lost a father and two brothers and Wilson a brother by the savages. Men are now in pursuit of the Indians. June 15. About the 5th instant a company of seven men were attacked on the trace from Cumberland to Kentucky near Big Barren by a party of Indians; three of the company were killed and two wounded. AUGUSTA June 15. Advices from our western frontiers mention that Major General Twiggs crossed the Oconnee with about 900 men on Saturday last on their way to the Cakmulgee where the infantry were to halt and build a fort. The cavalry amounting to 450 commanded by Brigadier Generals Irwin Clark and Blackburn were immediately to proceed to the lower Creek towns and procure satisfaction for the numerous unprovoked murders and devastations lately committed by that faithless tribe of savages. Brigadier General Glascock we are informed has received orders from the Commander in Chief to march to the frontiers in a few days with one- third of his brigade and part of the Augusta artillery.  ID105,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,10,03,inform,Upper Canada York July 28. Yesterday at an early hour his Honour Isaac Brock Esq. administering the Government of Upper Canada and Major-General commanding his Majesty's forces therein arrived at this place from Fort-George and accompanied by a numerous suite proceeded to the Government Building at four p.m. when he opened the present extra session of the Legislature and delivered the following speech to both houses :– Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislature Council and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly The urgency of the present crisis is the only consideration which would have induced me to call you together at a time when public as well as private duties elsewhere demand your care and attention. But Gentlemen when invaded by an enemy whose avowed object is the entire conquest of this province the voice of loyalty as well as of interest calls aloud to every person in the sphere in which he is placed to defend his country. Our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it ; they have evinced by the promptitude and loyalty of their conduct that they are worthy of the King whom they serve and of the constitution which they enjoy ; and it affords me particular satisfaction that while I address you as Legislators I speak to mean who in the day of danger will be ready to assist not only with their counsels but with their arms. We look Gentlemen to our militia as well as to the regular forces for our protection ; but I should be wanting to that important trust committed to my care if I attempted to conceal (what experience the great instructor of mankind especially of legislators has discovered) that amendment in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient. It is for you to consider what further improvements they still may require. Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly From the history and experience of our mother country we learn that in times of actual invasion or internal commotion the ordinary course of criminal laws has been found in adequate to secure his Majesty's Government from private treachery as well as from open disaffection ; and that at such times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws restraining for a limited period the liberty of individuals in many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the particulars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion of the province might justify me in the exercise of the full power reposed in me on such an emergency yet it will be more agreeable to me to receive the sanction of the Houses. A few traitors have already joined the enemy–have been suffered to come into the country with impunity–and have been harboured and concealed in the interior ; yet the general spirit of loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of this province is such as to authorise a just expectation that their efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing– The disaffected I am convinced are few–To protect and defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations is an object worthy of your most serious deliberations. The speech concludes with a call for supplies. Proclamation The unprovoked declaration of war by the United States of America against the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and its dependencies has been followed by the actual invasion of this province in a remote frontier of the western districts by a detachment of the United States. The officer commanding that detachment has thought proper to invite his Majesty's subjects not merely to a quiet and unresisting submission but insults them with a call to seek voluntarily the protection of his Government. Without condescending to repeat the illiberal epithets bestowed in this appeal of the American Commander to the people of Upper Canada on the administration of his Majesty every inhabitant of the province is desired to seek the confutation of such indecent slander in the review of his own particular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian subject who can truly affirm to himself that he has been injured by the Government in his person his property or his liberty? Where is to be found in any part of the world a growth so paid in prosperity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled not thirty years by a band of veterans exiled from their former possessions on account of their loyalty not a descendant of these brave people it to be found who under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment superior to what were possessed by their ancestors. This unequalled prosperity would not have been attained by the utmost liberality of the Government or the persevering industry of the people had not the maritime power of the mother country secured to its colonists a safe access to every market where the produce of their labour was in request. The unavoidable and immediate consequence of a separation from Great Britain must be the loss of this inestimable advantage and what is offered to you in exchange? To become a territory of the United States and share with them that exclusion from the ocean which the policy of their Government enforces ; you are not even flattered with a participation of their boasted independence ; and it is but too obvious that once exchanged from the powerful protection of the United Kingdom you must be re-annexed to the dominion of France from which the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms of Great Britain at vast expence of blood and treasure from no other motive than to relieve her ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire of France was the stipulated reward for the aid afforded to the revolted colonies now the United States ; the debt is still due and there can be no doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consideration for commercial advantages or rather for an expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over the commercial world. Are you prepared inhabitants of Canada to become willing subjects or rather slaves to the despot who rules the nation of Europe with a rod of iron? If not arise in a body exert your energies co-operate cordially with the King's regular forces to repel the invader and do not give cause to your children when groaning under the oppression of a foreign master to reproach you with having too easily parted with the richest inheritance of this earth–a participation in the name character and freedom of Britain. [The proclamation concludes with a declaration that should the Americans refused quarter in consequence of Indians being found in Canadian ranks that a severe and rigorous retaliation will take place.] Isaac Brock Major-Gen. and President Head-quarters Fort George July 22 1812.  ID107,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,11,09,inform,Extract of a letter from Montreal Sept. 25 Our Friend Mr – arrived in town from New York a few days ago. On his way he passed three days at Plattsburgh the head-quarters of the American army which from ocular observation he states to consist of 8 or 10000 men under the command of General Bloomfield Mooar and Petit. This force is composed of 3 or 4000 regulars about the same number of militia and some volunteers from the southward. The militia is almost all from the state of New York for the Yankees still refuse to march. with this force no doubt is entertained here but they will make an attack ; and if they mean to make it this season they must be prompt in their movements for the weather is getting cold and they are not well clothed or appointed. Mr – indeed states half of them to be without shoes or stockings which will never do for a winter campaign in this country. To repel the threatened attack we are making every preparation in our power and the Canadians seem well disposed to second the Government. Sir George Prevost has established a cordon the left of which is at Chambly and extending to Chateaguny ; the main encampment is half way between St John's and La Prairie. Colonel Murray is at St John's with a battalion ; and the Isle-auNoix is strongly fortified with a boom and a chain secured across the river. This line of defence is composed of four regiments of the line and 2000 drafted militia with a corps of about 400 Canadian voltigeurs raised last spring. The Royals a very strong battalion lately arrived from the West Indies are now marching to join the camp. The citizens both here and at Quebec mount guard and do garrison : indeed there are in this island (Montreal) five battalions of militia say 3 to 4000 men pretty well disciplined and who on an alarm could march to this cordon in half a day.– A new regiment of embodied militia has lately been formed by drafts from the different regiments of inrolled militia in this island and old Major Murray is appointed Lieutenant-Colonel. The gentlemen of the North-west Company army are forming a corps of their voyageurs who will be most useful troops to act in advance with the Indians. The number originally proposed was 200 but the men have come forward so handsomely that they are to consist of 500. Mr M'Gillivray is Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of this corps Mr Shaw Major and the other partners of the Company are Captains and subalterns ; so that the men being commanded by those whom they have accustomed to obey may be considered as already disciplined at least in point of subordination. Sir George confines his operations to mere defence. La Motte with about 70 Indians advanced through the woods about ten days ago within hearing of this redoubtable army and set up a war whoop which so completely terrified them that though they could see no enemy they lay on their arms for two two successive nights in no expectation of an attack–to prevent which they cut down their best bridge and destroyed all the roads by which I suppose they mean to invade us. Mr – who was several days at their headquarters and who was offered the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the army has it is said proposed to Sir George to destroy their camp with 500 men ; and Sir George is said to have replied that his plan was fixed not to make any attack nor to send a man across the line. This forebearance which the Yankees impute to fear or weakness tends only to increase their insolent swaggering and their enmity is to inveterate to be allayed by any thing but hard knocks.  ID109,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1813,10,07,inform,(From the Quebec Mercury.) Attack on Fort Schlosser. Head-quarters Kingston July 13. By accounts from the army under Major-General De Rottenburg dated the 9th instant the following particulars have been received of a bold and successful attempt to surprise the American post at Fort Schlosser. In the night of the 4th instant a party consisting of Volunteer Thompson and six privates of the 49th regiment under Ensign Winder and thirty-four of the militia the whole under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Clarke of the Lincoln militia crossed over in boats from Chippawa to Fort Schlosser which they reached a little before day-break and completely surprised the guard consisting of two Lieutenants one serjeant and eight privates whom they made prisoners together with three civilians and three of our own subjects found in the Fort.– The party remained in the Fort about one hour loading their boats form the public stores and wharf and brought with them one brass six-pounder 57 stand of arms two and a half kegs of musket ball cartridges 6 bulwarks of musket proof curtains for boats one gun-boat two batteaux 20 barrels of salt 17 casks tobacco eight barrels of pork and one barrel of whiskey with a number of spades oars and axes ; a small party of the enemy had collected as the last boast pushed off from the shore and several shots were fired but the boats returned to Chippawa with their prisoners and the articles they had captured without a man being hurt on this service. Further accounts have also been received from the army highly creditable to the Indian warriors serving with it. On the 8th instant a party of the King's regiment and a body of Indian warriors were sent to endeavour to recover a considerable quantity of medicines and surgical instruments which had been buried near the Fort George when our troops retired from it. A skirmish ensued in consequence between the Indians and the enemy in which the latter lost one officer and 20 men killed and 10 taken prisoners–the whole of the medicines and instruments were brought off by the party of the King's; the only loss sustained being three Indians wounded. Captain Norton led the Indian warriors with great spirit ; and much credit is due to Captain Merrit of the Provincial dragoons for reconnoitering the spot where the medicines were deposited and conducting the party to it. A few nights ago the barracks at Gravelly Point burnt by our gun-boats and more than 100 barrels of pork flour and other articles brought away from thence together with a very fine Durham boat–500 oars colleced and partly loaded in her for Sacket's Harbour being destroyed. Attack on Black Rock Head-quarters Kingston July 15 1813. G. O.–His Excellency the Commander of the forces has received a dispatch from Major General De Rottenburg reporting a successful attack upon the enemy's post and dockyard at Black Rock at daybreak on the morning of the 11th inst. by detachments of the King's and 41st regiments together with Liutenant Fitzgibbon's party of the 49th and about 40 militia the whole amounting to 240 men under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp. The enemy's position was carried by a spirited attack without the loss of a single man. Several large boats loaded with stores and provisions and three field pieces a twelve and two six-pounders were brought away ; a vessel and all the naval store-houses and barracks have been burnt. Unfortunately before the evacuation of the post was completed a strong reinforcement of the enemy aided by Indians pressed this small detachment by which Captain Saunders of the 41st and 15 men were killed ; Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp Lieutenant Montpesson of the 41st and 15 rank and file wound ed. The wounded were brought over. Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp has received three wounds severe but not considered dangerous. By his Excellency's command Edward Baynes Adjutant-General British Expedition to Plattsburgh The following is an extract of a letter from a respectable citizen at Burlington dated Aug. 1. 1813 An express arrived at Burlington on the 30th July with intelligence that the British had left the Isle au Noix with a force consisting of the two armed sloops of 11 guns each and four gallies of one gun each and 100 batteaux full of men and had progressed within one mile of the town. The camp was instantly alarmed and the troops under arms but no enemy appeared. Next day we learnt that about 1000 troops under the command of Colonel Murray had landed and took possession of Plattsburgh without opposition there being no force to oppose them except the militia of the town and vicinity who being only 400 in number retreated as the enemy advanced. The arsenal belonging to the State Pike's encampment barracks at Serenac cantonment and every building belonging to the United States were immediately burnt. The enemy obtained both provisions and stores. The loss cannot be less than 50000 dollars. The enemy left Plattsburgh on the 1st and are understood to be proceeding this way ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? On General Dearborn invading Canada and taking possession of Fort George he sent off to Greenbush as prisoners of war the following respectable inhabitants : Messrs Edwards Murehead Dickson Lyminston Lawe two Kerrs M'Ewan Parson Addison Howell Heron Green Baldwin Clinch Jones Ball Decoe and John Crook. Messrs Lawe M'Ewen and the two Kerrs were wounded on the 27th June. General Dearborn expected that the inhabitants would have joined the Americans. General Dearborn resigned the command of the Niagara army on the 23th June on account of indisposition. General Lewis says in his dispatch to Secretary at War that he did not think the General would ever again be fit for service ; that the unfortunate events of the war had deranged his understanding ; and that thought sometimes in a state of convalescence he uniformly relapsed when military topics were alluded to. General Lewis having been nominated to command at Sacket's Harbour is succeeded at Fort George Niagara and on the Canadian frontier by General Boyd. The Indian chief Tecumseh has seized the favourable moment of the diversion by our shipping in Virginia for surround Fort Meigs with 2000 warriors. He had deprived the garrison of all the possibility of receiving supplies. General Clay who commanded there had written urgently to General Harrison for assistance. The latter was collecting his army to march to his relief. Sir James Yeo after the retreat of the enemy's army at Fort George swept the American side of Lake Ontario. He landed a body of troops at Great Sodus and took the whole of the provisions consisting of several hundred barrels of pork and flour and burnt the buildings. The British loss was a serjeant and four privates of the Royal killed. At Genessee River he inflicted the same loss on the enemy taking 500 barrels of pork and 1700 bushels of corn. The provisions were delivered to General Vincent. Four companies of the Royals were embarked on board the fleet to serve as mariners There were at Quebec on the 22d July 1000 American prisoners of war captured since the commencement of the campaign. At Beaufort there were 50 officers including three General. In consequence of the conduct of the American Government and of the officers the latter are no longer permitted to return home on parole. The Melpomene frigate with De Meuron's regiment from the Mediterranean arrived in the river St. Lawrence on the 20th July. James Gready private in the 8th or King's regiment and Terence Hunt private in the 6th foot were in the latter end of June tried by Court Martials for deserting to the enemy and being found in arms and were publicy shot at Kingston Canada pursuant to their sentence. It appears from the Quebec papers and from the general orders issued by the Commander in Chief in Canada that on the late defeat of General Wilkinson on the banks of the Miami river the American military chest containing 15000l. Sterling was among the property captured by the British. Captain Waugh of the 103d regiment died at Chamely on the 2d July. General Hampton has arrested Colonel Clark the late commandant at Burlington for a defalcation of about 50000 dollars.  ID111,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1814,03,19,inform,The following letter received in town gives a description of the wanton and barbarous conduct of the American army in destroying a settlement of the Moravian missionaries in their late irruption into province:– Yesterday I received a very afflicting account from North America by a letter from New York dated Dec. 27 1813 concerning a report of the total destruction of our settlement ??? ??? on the 6th of October by the American army under General Harrison. It was the consequence of the invasion of that province after the capture of the little fleet on Lake Erie and the defeat of the s[?]al British force under the [?] of occupying the Chapel and some other houses for our sick British soldiers and considering the danger the Christian Indians were in from the malice of the Americans it was his advice that the Missionaries and the Indian Congregation should retreat farther into the country. When the Americans were successful in the latter it became necessary to take steps of effect it. The British behaved very kindly to the brethren and offered to purchase the houses and cottages but their defeat prevented it. On entering the place the Americans first pretended to be friendly and sorry that the Indians had fled who had gone with Mr and Mrs Denke (one of the Missionaries) up the river. Mr and Mrs Schnall and the aged Missionary Michael Young remained. During the first night the Americans already changed their tone or rather showed their real character. They began to abuse the Missionaries with curses and all manner of insults plundering the houses ; and General Harrison to whom we appealed would grant no redress. They took every thing that was??? away ; and under a pretence that King's stores and English goods were lodged in the houses ransacked every place and every trunk and chest belonging to individuals. Commodore Perry who had defeated the Mosquito fleet on the lake was there and behaved rather better than the rest advicing the Missionaries to get away as fast as they could. They did so with difficulty and shortly after the Americans set the place on fire and burnt down the whole even every outhouse[?]. The poor Missionaries had a very tedious journey and reached Silitiz a settlement of the Brethren in Pennsylvania December 11. Whither the Christian Indians have fled is not known ; they had proposed to go to the Grand River about 100 miles off.  ID115,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1814,10,15,inform,Canada Papers Quebec Sept. 3. The army from this province has entered the United States by the Champlain frontier. On the 1st inst. the advance was at Chazy. Quebec Sept. 8. From the north-western frontier of Upper Canada Messrs M'Gillivray and M'Leod who arrived here on Thursday last have brought dispatches from Lieutenant Colonel M'Donal at Michillimackinac written since the repulse of the American forces sent there to recapture it. The following are the particulars of that expedition :– On the forenoon of the 5th of August the Americans landed 900 men or thereabouts at the back of the island (Dowsman's farm). There is a considerable space of ground cleared and a gentle slope which enabled their vessels at anchor close to the beach to keep clear by a constant fire of grape &c. and which by the situation of the ground passed directly over the men's heads as they formed and advanced towards the woods. Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual[?] formed his small garrison (150 at most) at the extremity of the woods and the Indians were stationed on each flank to keep the enemy from outflanking the troops. By a false account of the enemy's intention to land on another part of the island a certain number of Indians were sent to watch their motions ; but more Indians absenting themselves exposed one flank of Lieutenant-Colonnel M'Doual's party entirely ; and an apprehension was entertained that the enemy would outflank and cut off the garrison from the forts ; it was therefore deemed expedient to fall back between the two forts and there await the advance of the enemy. A party of between 40 and 50 Indians placed on the left flank and ignorant of the movements in the centre and right flank fired on the Americans and threw them into confusion which the Indians soon perceived and encouraging each other by whoops and yells totally broke the little order still observed by the enemy who took instant flight and were all out of reach before Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual was apprised of their retreat. Thus was a body of at least from six to nine hundred men defeated and put to instant flight by 40 or 50 Indians with a loss of 17 men and a Major (Holmes) killed and found on the spot!–The Indians lost but one man. Previous to and combined with this the measures taken by the enemy were these: On the [?] of July a detachment of the expedition sent against Michillimackinac by the enemy proceeded to St Mary's where they met with no resistance there being neither troops nor Indians and every person occupied about their usual concerns ; such as bay making fishing &c. Major Holmes commanded the party who gave up to indiscriminate plunder and destroyed the whole of the property belonging to the North West Company ; burning their houses stores and vessels killing their cattle and taking off their engagees prisoners ; tearing down the fences destroying the gardens fields &c. Many wanton acts of cruelty might be detailed. Let two suffice for the present. Mr Johnstone's property was plundered even his furniture ; the very clothing of his wife and children was seized upon by these ruthless plunderers and carried away. Major Holmes sent to the south side of the strait for Mr Johnstone's son George and after threatening and reviling him with the most oppobrious language flourished his sword over his head and said he had a great mind to cut his head off now he was his slave When they were in the act of burning the houses and stores Mr G. Johnstone was ordered to stand in a certain spot under pain of being shot ; but had he remained sufforation[?] must have been his fate being so near the buildings in flames : he therefore risked being shot and came off and thereby effected a timely escape. Another instance of more than savage cruelty was exercised on a poor horse which they made us of all day in carting their plunder and in the evening whilst still tackled to the cart tied him to the end of the dwelling-house then in flames and amused themselves in looking at the poor animal making vain efforts to get loose ; but there he was burnt and his bones seen there by the writer of this.  ID116,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1814,12,08,inform,Canada Papers Montreal Oct. 29 The express from Upper Canada which arrived yesterday morning confirmed the highly satisfactory reports of the preceding day that the enemy had precipitately retreated on the 19th instant from before Chippawa after destroying a quantity of provisions and heavy baggage ; and that on the 21st they had passed over to Buffaloe a great part of their force and were blowing up the works at Fort Erie. Further accounts from Kingston have been received this morning to the 26th instant when the official report of the enemy's retreat from Fort Erie after the destruction of the works had not reached that place but there was no doubt of the fact. Major-Genera de Watteville commanded the corps pressing on the enemy ; the master of a mail which arrived at Kingston on the 25th in twenty-four hours from Fort George further confirms the previous intelligence and reports that several hundred prisoners were taken before the Americans effected their escape across the river. On the 18th the British came up with his rear guard and in a sharp action thirty of the Americans were left on the field wihtout a casualty happening on our side. This was at Chippawa Creek.– The enemy then fled with the utmost precipitation to Fort Erie and began the destruction of his fortifications. A military courier from Kingston arrived this morning brings no additional news of importance.– Sir James Yeo had returned to Kingston with the sick of the army of Niagara on board. We again sailed for the head of the Lake. A private letter from Niagara of the 10th instant says that a severe action took place the day before near Chippawa ; our loss is stated at 10 killed and wounded. That of the enemy is supposed to be very considerable ; a field piece made to bear upon one of his columns did great execution. Another letter denies any loss in killed but makes the wounded 25 or 30. Montreal Nov. 5. From Upper Canada we have received nothing of importance. The report of the whole American armies have crossed the Niagara was a mistake as the last accounts from that quarter mention that General Brown was still in possession of Fort Erie. Quebec Nov. 3. We are in expectation of some further details of the operations on the Niagara frontier by this day's Montreal post ; but they had no arrived at one o'clock. The evacuation by the enemy of our territory on that frontier is a striking illustration of the importance of the command of the lake. The enemy did cross over to our side till the moment his fleet was ready to assume the superiority. The re-appearance of our fleet effected what could not be done by the expence of so much blood and treasure. (From the Quebec Gazette) The American Government has published the pa pers relating to the late negotations at Ghent. We confess that we have seen these papers with feelings of some satisfaction and much regret ; satisfaction that we can now say that the honour of the British Government is pledged to do something for British interests in North American and regret that that something is so little. The Indians are to be made independent of both nations. This is perfectly just and would under certain cirumstances greatly add to the security of these provinces. The Lakes are to be exclusively British. On these subjects we must be permitted to ask how long they would be permitted to remain so how long the Indians would retain their independence in the event of another war if the communication with them should be in the power of the enemy ? The sole communication for military purposes with the Indians and the Lakes is by the river St Lawrence from Montreal to Kingston and from Niagara to Fort Erie ; and the Americans are to be permitted to remain in possession of one of its banks ! The enemy has hitherto been prevented from interrupting this communication by the thinness of the settlements of their side the consequent badness of the roads and difficulty of supplying a large force. The possession of th southern bank of the St Lawrence between Montreal and Kingson and the power of supplying themselves and operating on that frontier by the roads now existing and from Lake Champlain has been worth a large force to them during the whole of the war ; it has caused us to parcel our force to support the line of communication between Lake St Francis and Kingston and keep a great proportion of it to protect the base of that line in the vicinity of Montreal. The position of Canada relative to the United States with its present boundaries is an extraordinary one ; so much so that intelligent military men have pronounced it incapable of defence much beyond Quebec. The miserable state of the enemy's preparations the superiority which we then had on the Lakes the good disposition of the inhabitants and the prudent conduct of the commander of the forces alone saved it. The waste of means in protecting and conveying supplies by a communication of five hundred miles adjoining the whole way to the enemy's frontie is conceivable only to those whom experience has made acquainted with the fact or who are habituated to reflection ; and whenever the communication of the Lakes becomes interrupted the supply of any force further advanced on the line becomes utterly impracticable. The enemy derives his supplies either by the Lakes upon which an army can effect nothing or from a settled country a long way in his rear protected by his army a country covered with woods and a militia more effective than the best troops in such a country always ready for the protection of their property and their houses– Under such circumstances the weakness of an army beyond a certain point is to be counted by its numbers. We scruple not to say that whenever that part of the State of New York extending to the St Lawrence between Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain shall be fully settled the whole of Upper Canada must fall to the United States the Lower Canada will not be defensible but at an expence of means far beyond its value. We had much rather see the Americans confirmed in the possession of Sackett's Harbour Presqu-ile Detroit and Michilimackinac than in the possession of the tract of country just mentioned. Great Britain will always have the means of establishing a superiority on the Lakes whenever she chuses to exert them but she never will be able to drive the Americans out of that frontier when once fully settled supported as they will be by the immense population of the back parts of the State of New York and adjoining States. From the United States Papers Urbanna Sept. 25. An express has arrived from Detroit to General M'Arthur in six days in which Governor Cass says– A state of things has arrived in which your presence with the force at your disposal is essential to the security and preservation of the country. The Indians have recommenced hostilities on every side of us ; they are murdering the people and breaking up the settlements. There is now a large force of them in the immediate vicinity of this place most probably within a mile of it with the avowed purpose of attacking the town. We have no force adequate to the defence of the country and none of description proper for the pursuit of the Indians– My opinion is that you should hasten on with the mounted men with all possible expedition. The express came by water the land communiation being entirely cut off. Albany Oct. 25. The Legislature of this State adjourned yesterday after a session of four weeks. The principal laws passed are: An act to authorise the raising of troops for the defence of this State. An act to encourage privateering. An act to authorise the raising of a corps of sea fencibles. An act to provide for the repayment of certain sums of money advanced by the Corporation of the city of New York for the defence of the State and for other purposes. An act to prevent the apprehension of British deserters. An act to authorise the raising of two regiments of men of colour. An act authorising additional pay to be made to the volunteers and for paying the militia called into service by the State authority. An act to aid in the apprehension of deserters from the army and navy of the United States. The first act authorises the Governor to call into actual service 12000 men for the term of two years provided the Government of the United States shall have declared their intention to pay clothe and subsist them at their expence. The privateer bill authorises associations to incorporate themselves for the purpose of fitting out privateers. The following resolution introduced by Mr Monell passed both Houses of our Legislature unanimously on Saturday:– Resolved unanimously–That the House of Assembly of the State of New York view with mingled emotions of surprise and indignation the extravagant and disgraceful terms proposed by the British Commissioners at Ghent–that however ardently they may desire the restoration of peace to their country they can never consent to receive it at the sacrifice of national honour and dignity–that they therefore strongly recommend to the National Legislature the adoption of the vigorous and efficacious measures in the prosecution of the war as the best means of the bringing the contest to an honourable termination and of transmitting unimpaired to their posterity their rights liberty and independence. The following is a private letter which was brought by the Liffey : Montreal Nov. 5. 1814. Sir George Prevost reached Kingston on the 10th October where his presence has been of the utmost importance. Chauncey resigned his blockade of that place on the 8th and retired with his squadron to Sackett's Harbour. Our fleet which was ready for the Lake in a few days after Sir George's arrival sailed for Niagara on the 16th with 500 of the 90th and a supply of provisions and stores for the right division and arrived off Fort George on the evening of the 18th. Having landed this reinforce ment Sir James returned to Kingston on the 24th. The enemy at Fort Erie having been joined by General Izard's army making a force of 7 or 8000 men advanced upon General Drummond and attacked our positions upon the Chippawa on the 15th instant ; but having met with an opposition unexpected by them and making no impression retired on the 16th and 17th to Black Creek from whence they advanced one of Izard's brigades 1500 men on the 19th with a view of our turning our right and attempted to cross the Chippawa about six miles from its mouth where they were met with by a corps of about 1000 troops under Colonel Meyers who faced them most manfully ; they skirmished the whole day in which the Glengarries supported their high character and in the evening Jonathan finding himself foiled and unable to bring up his artillery from the horrid state of the roads retired again to the main body at Black Creek. Our casualties on this occasion were triflin– those of the enemy were said to have been considerable though he refrained from exposing himself to our fire in the open ground. We had two field-pieces there and whenever the enemy showed a column out of the wood a well-directed discharge soon obliged them to return to their shelter. By this time our fleet being announced gave alarm to the enemy and they commenced a precipitate retreat to Fort Erie. They were purused on the 20th and 21st by our advance under Major-General Watteville close to Fort Erie where he found them occupying the high ground which General Drummond had not left many weeks before and could push no further. At the date of the last accounts from General Drummond Jonathan still maintained his post from which it will require a few columns of fresh troops to dislodge him but as they are now on their way to join the right dividion I trust I shall in a short time have the pleasure to acquaint you of the complete expulsion of the enemy from the Niagara frontier. It is said that for want of sufficient shelter a part of General Izard's force had crossed to Buffalo and that they had passed over some heavy artillery and stores leaving at the fort such a force as they conceived capable of defending it. Sir James brough down with him the skeleton of the 1st battalion of the King's regiment and the remains of the two flank companies of the 10th. He sailed again on the 1st inst. taking with him about 1200 men comprising the 37th a brigade of artillery a 9pounder and detachments from the 6th and 82d regiments and a large supply of provisions and stores. The five hundred of the 9th regiment who marched to York would be crossed to Niagara in the brigs ; the 9th 850 strong were to have been embarked in the fleet but Sir James could not take them. The Royals 41st 89th and 100th exhausted corps return to Kingston by this trip of the fleet which I fear was scarcely able to make another this season. The St Lawrence has proved a noble ship and one and all seem delighted with her. The frigate in frame arrived at Kingston where she has been laid down and lengthened to make her the size of the Prince Regent. The keel of a 74 is also laid down there. The Americans are said to have commenced upon two more ships of the class of the Superior. Letters from Michilimacinack to the 19th October state that the capture of the two schooners will be attended with the most important benefits in the security of that post and the territory dependent upon it. Captain Rocheblave with the detachment of the 81st under Capt. Wardrop and artillery arrived there on the 14th October without any casualty among the troops ; and Mr M'Kenzie with his brigade would arrive about the 21st. The two schooners had made a trip to Nottawasage for provisions and supplies and would attempt another before the navigation closed. A reinforcement had been sent under Capt Bulgar to Praire du Chain. The arrangements necessary for reinforcing and supplying General Drummond's army being completed and the attack upon Sackett's Harbour being deemed impracticable this season Sir George returned last evening to this place ; his journey to Kingston has certainly had the effect of inducing General Brown with a considerable part of his force to move to Sackett's Harbour and has thus left General Izard so much weakened at Fort Erie that I have little doubt of the result of an attack upon him. I am sorry to see that the malice of a certain party here has been at work at your side of the water ; it has increased tenfold since the expression of the public sentiment in favour of his Excellency by the addresses which are now preparing and which I can assure you is the real and unsolicited voice of the people. I am happy to find that General Kempt is going to England as he will afford true information upon the state of the country and be able to exposethe falsehoods which have been circulated respecting recent events.  ID120,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1816,12,16,inform,Canada Lord Selkirk We have been favoured by a Gentleman in this city with the following interesting and authentic communication on the subject of the dispute between Lord Selkirk and the Gentlemen of the North West Company: Extract of a Letter from Montreal dated 6th October 1816. In the newspapers which I sent you you will see some accounts of the disturbances which have taken place in the North West between the North West Company and Lord Selkirk's colonists. The latter have been obliged to leave the Red River after having had 22 of their men including Governor Semple killed by a party of half-breeds the spurious offspring of the North West Company. As yet have not had an accurate statement of that melancholy transaction. Lord Selkirk's party state that these half-breed with some of the North West Com pany servants came to destroy the settlement and that Mr Semple with about 25 of the Colonists went out to meet them to know what could be their intentions when those rascals commenced firing on them and massacred all but three who were fortunate enough to make their escape. The North West people's account is that these half-breeds with some Indians were bringing down provisions from the upper part of the Red River to the entrance near Lake Winipie and as the Colonists had the command of a great part of the river they were obliged to pass in the rear of the settlement which being observed by Governor Semple who was on the look-out for them he settled out of his Fort with 25 men and a [?]-piece to take from the Indians the provisions which were intended for the North West Company ; that the result[?] was an engagement which terminated in the defeat of the Colonists of whom twenty-two were killed. Lord Selkirk [?] from Montreal for the Red River about the latter end of June when[?] three or four officers and about 150 men of De Men[?]'s regiment which had been disbanded and when he arrived at Fort William on Lake Superior hearing the fate of his Colonists he[?] immediately issued a warrant against Mr M'Gillivray for high treason conspiracy and murder and subsequently warrants against all the partners of the N. W. Company who were at F William [?] formal possession of their establishment there and sent Mr M'Gillivray with about ten others prisoners to Montreal with all their papers [?] a number of packs of Beaver and other Furs and several bales[?] of Merchandise which he found in possession of the North West Company belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company. The Police Officers in Montreal were several days examining the papers and about four or five days after the arrival of Mr M'Gillivray and the others they were admitted to bail to appear to take their trial at the next criminal court or any court of Oyer and Terminer which may be appointed. Stuart (the ci-de vant Solicitor-General who was dismissed by Sir James Craig and at whose instance an ineffectual attempt was lately made by some misguided members of our House of Assembly to impeach Chief Justices Sewell and Monk) is one of Lord Selkirk's counsel and spoke at great length and what his friends and admirers call very eloquently strongly opposed their being admitted to bail but all would not do and they were accordingly bailed ; Mr M'Gillivray in sureties of t1000 and the others in t500 sums inconsiderable enough advering to the high crimes and misdemeanours with which they were charged. In the Montreal Herald you will see a very learned and (as our neighbour Jonathan would say) a lengthy communication signed Montius[?] setting forth the rights which the Hudson's Bay Company by their charter possess over the Countries which they have granted to Lord Selkirk and the power vested in him of appointing Governors and other Officers to superintend and regulate the Colony. Being a masterly production it will no doubt makes its appearance in a pamphlet and when it does I shall send you one in case the papers should miscarry. It is uncertain whether the Earl will remain in the North West during the winter or come down to Montreal ; if the latter he must be down[?] soon[?] as the season for water-travelling will shortly close. Montreal is now divided into two parties one favouring the Lord and the other the North West Company ; and with the exception of the friends of the latter strongly in favour of his Lordship.  ID139,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,01,inform,Leeds April 19.–We have been somewhat alarmed here to-day though no bad consequences have followed by a most numerous assemblage of croppers cloth-dressers and other artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep com ing in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley Armley Holbeck and all the neighbouring towns and villages and it is computed that at one time there were full three thousand of these distressed people assembled chiefly in Briggate. As many of them marched into the town with great sticks in their hands they created some little alarm but their conduct was uniformly peaceable; their complaints were not loud though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and Magistrates with the whole of the Civil Power were in rea diness to act as circumstances might require; but fortunately there was not the slightest occasion for their interference. By far the greater number of the assemblage dispersed by noon and returned to their respective homes. Several respectable gentlemen went among them to ascertain the motives of their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it does not appear that they have the least disposition to commit any breath of the peace ; but in fact the people know not what to do in their present state of distress. I understand that an active subscription is going to enable a number of these poor men to proceed to Canada; and others are said to have expressed their wish to be sent to Botany Bay provided they can obtain the sanction of Government. The case of these people is a very perplexing one ; for their numbers augment daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories. Chester April 19.–John Bagguely John Drummond and Samuel Johnson convicted of sedition on the 15th inst. were this day after an adrdress from the Chief-Justice (Mr Serjeant Copley) sentenced to two years' imprisonment and to find security for their good behaviour for two years each in L.500 himself with sureties in L.100 each. We are sorry to hear that great number of the agricultural poor are out of employ in Monmouthshire and that the amount of wages diminishes as works get scarcer. Emigration to America still continues; but it is for the most part of a description of person who have afforded employ to others rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some property with them. Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States there are twenty six persons belonging to one family (Quakers of the name of Thistlewaith) lately residing in Meadow lane Leeds. These industrious and enterprising individuals are gone with an intention of carrying on the woollen manufacture (in conjunction with others) on an extensive scale either at Philadelphia or some other more eligible site in its vicinity. Several other families are preparing to emigrate from the same neighbourhood as well as from Dewsbury Bradford and other places in the vicinity. It is true these extensive emigrations may in some degree contribute to relieve our overburdened population ; but they must likewise tend in an equal ratio to impoverish the nation ; as every individual and family who emigrate setting aside the pecuniary wealth they carry with them take what is of far more consequence to a commercial nation–their talents and industry–articles at present of comparative small value in the country. The very heavy impost which is at present levied upon authors and publishers by being compelled under the existing Copyright Act to deliver eleven copies of every book published to certain public libraries is likely to be repealed by a Bill to be brought into Parliament in a few days. The body of evidence taken before the Select Committe of the House of Commons last year forms a most interesting display of the state of literary property in this country. Saturday last Mr Stuart and Mr Allsop were returned for the Borough of Camelford. Yesterday the Grand Jury for the County of Middlesex found two Bills of Indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury against five of the principal witnesses produced in behalf of the petitioner who were examined before the Select Committee appointed to try the merits of the election fo Penrhyn. Extraordinary Legacy. –A very singular cause is now depending before the Court of Session in Scotland respecting a legacy to the amount of upwards of fifty thousand pounds bequeathed by the late Earl of F. (who died at Berlin) to a foreigner who was one of his domestic servants. The payment of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the late Earl on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consideration ; and from its novelty the case is of course the subject of much conversation in the Northern Metropolis. The arguments and pleadings in this extraordinary suit in which the most eminent counsel of the Edinburgh Bar are engaged display much classical as well as legal learning ; but no judgement has yet been pronounced by the Court. From the magnitude of the sum in dispute it will probably be finally determined by an appeal to the House of Lords.– Morn. Chron. Town Hall Southwark. –Thomas Wing was brought up by Reeve the Marshalman and examined before Sir John Earner[?] the sitting Magistrate charged on suspicion of robbing his employers Messrs Sentance and Flint grocers NO. 300. Borough High-street. The prisoner's detection was caused in the following singular manner :–He was porter to the prosecutors and was frequently about the shop ; a large house dog having seen him take money from the till which he tied in his pocket handkerchief followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a shed near the stables and then he came into the shop and appeared quite restless pulling every person by the skirt[?] and apparently wishing them to follow him. At length Henry Heydon the apprentice having occasion to go to the stable the dog followed him and having drawn his attention to the heap of rubbish under which the money was buried began to scratch at it till he brought the booty to view ! The apprentice brought it to his master who counted and found it to contain 12s. in copper coin. After marking it he desired the boy to place it in the same spot which he did and soon afterwards finding that it was removed he asked the prisoner some questions about it but he declared his ignorance of the whole transaction. Reeve the Marshalman was then sent for who on searching the prisoner found some of the marked ballpence[?] in his pocket.–Remanded. Bank Committee. –The Opposition Journals last wek asserted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House of Commons intend to report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of paying in specie. That is the Bank shall pay next January in gold bars at the present price of gold L.4 1s. per ounce any quanitity of notes not being less than sixty or a hundred pounds' worth and that in two years afterwards they shall pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold L.3 17s. 10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's plan goes farther. It recommends that the Bank shall never pay in coin but in bars of gold at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall at all times buy gold when offered at L.3 17s. and sell it when demanded at L.3 17s. 10 1/2d. If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the Restriction Committee intend to report in favour of payments in bullion at the market price ; and should Parliament adopt that plan ; then there will be a very great saving to the nation in the expense of coinage the waste of &c. All the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in foreign commerce will be answered as well by payments in gold bars as by payments in coins and the danger of a domestic run on the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic as in 1797 will be completely prevented. This is indeed at all times the only danger to which it is exposed. A run for coin on the Country Banks would instantly fall on the Bank of England and would cramp if not dry upthe currency throughout the empire producing the greatest confusion. Now if the Opposition Journals be correct the currency will be placed in perfect security at perfect ease. Nothing will be able to disorder it. If persons will hoard specie they must purchase gold bars or foreign coin or content themselves with silver. In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the amount of L.800000 each year and then the value of gold was rather below the standard price. In the year 1817 we imported to the amount of six millions and in the year 1818 we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. During the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have an abundant harvest or two and little importation of corn become necessary gold will again fall very low. The Bank will then be able to pay to buy gold to the full extent of Mr Ricardo's plan and to place their notes on a firm unquestionable foundation. The finances of the continent and of the world indeed–the sources and circulation of money will during peace gradually become steadier and better known. The East Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quantity of specie while Spanish America in consequence of her troubles yields far less than usual. It would be madness to fly in the face of all these circumstances by compelling the Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may be desirable to limit the issue of bank notes to some certain yet liberal amount. We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the Committee ; but if some rumours be true we augur favourably of it. It[?] is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee and stood alone in voting against the Report. Thus then the Report cannot be in favour of a very sudden or decided plan for the resumpion of cash payments or Mr Tierney would not have voted against it ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable prospect of a rational scheme for that resumption or the other five or six Opposition Members of the Committee would not have voted for it. – Courier. Grand Pigeon Match three Gentlemen of the Midgham Club against thrice of All England took place on Monday on Farnham Downs at twenty-one birds twenty-one yards distance from the gun for 150 guineas aside charge unlimited. Messrs Adams Russel and Holt were selected from the Crack Club against Messrs King Short and Keans. The sports were as follows ; Mr Adams killed nineteen birds and the remaining two were severely hit. Russel killed eighteen but lost one three yards out of bounds and Mr Holt bagged sixteen making a grand total of fifty-two from sixty-three. The Club was at first backed to win but the England shots were now backed freely at six to four as they were considered safe eighteen bird men. Mr King killed twenty but lost two out of bounds. Short missed his first three which brought betting to two to one onn the Club but he killed the next seventeen and missed the last bird. Mr Keans had seventeen to tie and eighteen to win and he was back at five to four and at two to one after killing eleven birds in succession. He however missed the seventeenth and had to kill the other four to win. He succeeded and the prize was won by once bird. It was altogether the most interesting match of this sort known for years. Letters from Petersburgh of the 15th ultimo mention that Prince Gustavus of Sweden son of King Gustavus IV. has obtained permission from the Emperor his uncle to proceed to England for the purpose of completing his studies at Oxford. Reports speak highly of the virtues and talents of this unfortunate young Prince who excites universal interest and sympathy in the north of Europe. In these feelings we must largely share for we cannot easily forget the associations with which the name of Vasa was connected not the services rendered by two Sovereigns of that Illustrious House to the cause of civil and religious liberty. It is said that a great Potentate whose generosity and magnanimity are proverbial has settled upon Prince Gustavus an allowance of L. 2000 Sterling per annum during the residence of the latter in England and that on the return of his Royal Highness to the Continent he is to espouse his cousin a Princess of Hesse Cassel who if rumour be correct has lately refused a matrimonial alliance with the new Swedish dynasty. Papers arrivedon Saturday from New York and Boston to the 15th ult. The National Intelligencer in an article occupying five columns under the head of Strictures on Mr Lacock's Report on the Seminole War defends the sanguinary proceedings of General Jackson. This production is said to have excited a great sensation throughout the United States being supposed to express the sentiments of the Executive. The General had left Washington for his residence in Tenessee. By an arrival from Aux Cayes intelligence was stated to be received that Sir G M'Gregor's troops had deserted him owing to the want of funds for their subsistence.  ID314,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,01,inform,Kentucky May 19.1790. We arrived safe at this place??? beginning of April from Pittsburgh and adreadful passage we had of it. The waters of??? river Ohio which had risen rapidly since March now poured down in a perfect torrent;??? we were in as much danger of foundering at??? rapids as we would have been in the middlethe Atlantic in a severe gale. We were frequently too in the most imminent danger of our life from the limbs of trees hanging just above the???; and through which we were often hurried??? rate of seven miles an hour but the impetuo??? of the stream. If any of the canoes had been tangled among these branches (which in manyplaces hang very thick over the river) they??? inevitably have been overturned and?????? buried in the ??? of the Ohio; fortunately??? accident happened to us. Our apprehensions of drowning were equalled by those of an attack from theIndians who infest the river and who inhabit??? banks: Some time ago they killed a Mr. W??? Browne and a Mr. Allison who were returning to Lexington from Miami. The barbarities they commit are wanton and inhuman to the l??? degree. On the 3d ult. they attacked a boat??? few miles from Limestone and killed three???sons two men and a woman; a few days after this they killed two men on Licking river and took a boy prisoner and on their return at???ed a boat below the Scioto as it came to sh??? and killed four men and took one man and two women prisoners. About three weeks ago they???ed on a boat and a canoe above the Scioto??? both sides of the river at the same time bywhich means they killed two men; and in sho??? to such a degree have they carried these inh??? practices that it is dangerous to stir fromhome but in large parties and properly prepar??? to receive them.  ID315,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,01,inform,Yesterday forenoon arrived at Spithead the Lord Dorcester merchantman Edward Howe master bound from Halifax for London. In this ship came six Cherokee Chiefs of the first rank one of them born in England. As soon as their arrival was announced in form Sir Andrew Douglas Commander of the Alcide of 74 guns sent his barge to bring them ashore to Portsmouth; and upon landing they went to Bradley's the crown Inn. The object of these Chiefs coming to this country is to endeavour to form a connection with the English Government in order to attempt the reduction of Mexico near which place they have 20000 men in arms and can raise 30000 more in a short time. The Cherokees have menaced that country for these last three years and are favoured by great number of the inhabitants in the Spanish settlements; should they therefore procure respectable assistance from England the New World will be a certain conquest and open a source of trade and wealth to this nation that will more than compensate for the loss of America and the expence of attaining that grand object. These Indian Chiefs are dressed in the habit of their country with their faces painted in an extraordinary manner. They waited on Colonel Trigge of the 12th regiment of foot and some other officers of distinction. One of them who was born in England named Bowles speaks English indifferently well and is extremely communicative. He went over to America with his parents who were in the army when a boy and by some means strayed to an Indian camp where he was most hospitably received and afterwards rais ed to the highest honours of their nation. The Cherokee Chiefs are expected in town this day to deliver their??? to Mr. Secretary Grenville.  ID316,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,07,inform,MONDAY J AN. 7. By the Fanny Capt. Bryen arrived in twenty four days from New York we have American papers of which we give the following important intelligence:– It is an undoubted truth (Strange as it may appear) that the Baron D'Carondolet Governor of Louisiana and Governor O'Neal of Pensaco la have opened the shores of the King of Spain in West-Florida to the Creeks and Cherokees and delivered them arms and ammunition in abundance advising and stimulating them to go to war against the frontier inhabitants of the United States and that quickly that now or never was the time while the United States were engaged with the northern tribes. On the 30th of September about midnight John Buchanan's station four miles south of Nashville) at which sundry families had collected and fifteen gunmen) was attacked by a part of Creeks and Lower Cherokees supposed to consist of three of our hundred. Their approach was suspected by the running of cattle that had taken fright at them and upon examination they were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of the gate and from the place and distance they received the first fire from the man who discovered them John M'Rocy. They immediately returned the fire and continued a very heavy and constant firing upon the station blockhouses surrounded with a stockade for an hour and were repulsed with considerable loss without injuring man woman or child in the station. During the whole time of the attack the Indians were never more distant than ten yards from the Block House and often in large numbers close round the lower walls attempting to put fire to it. One ascended the roof with a torch where he was shot and falling to the ground renewed his attempts to fire the bottom logs and was killed. The Indians fired 30 balls through a port hole of the over???ing which lodged in the roof in the circumference of the bat and those sticking in the walls on the outside are innumerable. Undoubted advices have been received that as early at the 18th of September as many as 500 Creeks passed the Tennessee and the lower Cherokee towns and below as on their way they decared to make war on Cumberland–and that they were joined by about 100 Cherokees of those towns.–This must have been the party that attacked Buchanan's station. Dreadful havoc was expected but it is now hoped that the check they have received will induce them to return without making further attempts upon that settlement. On the 3d instant. Black's Block House on the head of Crooked Creek (a branch of Little River) at which there was a serjeant's command of Cape Crawford's company was attacked by surprise about an hour and a half in the night by a party of Indians commanded by a Cherokee of Will's Town called the Tail a brother of the Bench and Talohteske consisting of 3 other Cherokees and 5 Creeks. James Paul was killed in the knife and George Morse and Robert Sharp at a fire on the outside and John Shankland wounded 3 horses were killed and 7 taken off. These are the fruits of the advise of the Baron D'Carrondolet and Governor O'Neal; and it is due to Mr. Paton their chief instrument to add he has well acted his part!!! We hear from Fayetteville (North Carolina) that on Tuesday the 23d of October last a fire broke out in that town owing to the negligence of a small negro girl which consumed about 40 dwelling houses and stores and 28 buildings of other descriptions.  ID317,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,27,inform,Richmond January 28. Extract of a letter from a Gentleman now residing at Quebec to his Correspondent in this City dated Jan. 9 1972 Our humanity was deeply affected by the dreadful carnage made by the Indians. You may be assured that the number of Indians did not exceed 1000 and that nothing saved General St. Clair and the remainder of his army but the great quantity of plunder he left to the Indians; they were composed of various tribes and three-fourths of of them remained in the camp to plunder it and to take scalps the trophies of their victory; and he that got most when he returned to his nation acquired the greatest share of glory; hence only about 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is under 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they have obtained at so easy a purchase and the riches they obtained by the plunder and the provisions they found will make them a more terrible foe than ever they have been; they boast of taking an amazing quantity of powder and arms which they wanted; many of them were only armed with spears and hatchets and I have no doubt but if another expedition should be set on foot that they will be met by three times the number of Indians. The indian tribes of nations who live many hundred miles back have all entered into an association and made the present war a common concern they to oppose what they call the common enemy. The warriors of the different tribes so united are not less than 15 or 20000; numbers of the chiefs of ten or twelve numerous nations were here last summer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make peace and offered his mediations; he told them he was at peace with the United States and could give them no assistance. Their answer was that the enemy was in their country and would not make peace with them but on term dishonourable and at the expense of their country and that they had determined to die before they would accept of such terms. They felt much dissatisfied with the answer they received and departed with a full determination to defend their country with the last of their blood. You may depend on it that many years will elapse and many thousand men be expended before the United States will by the present measures be able to possess the country in contest; and I may also add that I have great apprehensions that desolation and destruction will be the consequence on the frontiers of the Ohio this winter and next spring; I would to God some steps might be taken to prevent them. I have no doubt the country might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the expence already incurred by the different expeditions; the attempt to take the country from them by force is founded in unrighteousness and ought to be abandoned; besides if the American mean to have anytrade with them they are taking steps that will prevent it for many years to come.

Scott brought in near 700 scalps.  ID318,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,06,27,inform,The unsettled state of a great part of the Westtern Frontiers of America (if we can suppose that there are any determined frontiers when the settlers are making large and continual encroachments) must very much depreciate the sale of lands in those parts notwithstanding the very small rates of purchase demanded for vast extents of ground and the soil being remarkable fertile and productive. The ineffectual attempts of last summer to prevent the future depredations of the Miamis and some other tribes of Indians and the barbarities before and since committed on the setlers must occasion other people to be very cautious of removing to places where they would hold their lives and property on a very precarious teure unless the arms of the State prove remarkably successful in their future attacks.  ID319,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,05,02,inform,Nassau New England March 12. The red bugs which did so much injury to the cotton last year have again made their appearance but not in such numbers as was first expected. The hops in many States of America have been particularly productive. A letter from Great-Ogreechee in Georgia dated December 9th says since the completion of the treaty with the Creeks all has been very quiet unless we except some ill-natured state - bickerings and heart-burning amongst ourselves chiefly occasioned by a few influential men who find themselves great losers by a general act of common justice towards the Indians. These however we expect will subside by degrees; notwithstanding the formidable combination in a certain part of the State. As to the Creeks Siminoles and other nations adjoining our Western frontier nothing is clearer than that so far from being injurious to us they may henceforward be made useful to the real interests of this State provided the faith of treaties be observed. They now show every disposition to copy our manners arts agriculture and mode of living.  ID320,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,03,04,inform,Mr. Bowles the Cherokee Chief proposes to introduce the art of Printing amongst the Indians with whom he resides; and for this purpose has engaged two persons to accompany him on his return and has provided himself with all the implements of the art. The day fixed for their departure is the 20th of March The Indian companions of Mr. Bowles are two Creeks and two Cherokees. these nations though contiguous to each other and in strict union differ as essentially as possible in language and manners. Both however entertain the most implacable animosity against the Spaniards whose authority and dominions in South America they make no scruple of avowing they mean to try to diminish.  ID321,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,05,inform,The Indian Chiefs lately arrived in town are six in number. They have been indiscriminately styled Cherokees but three of them only are of that nation and three are Creek Indians.–They are all handsome men not exceeding in age twenty - five or twenty-six. These six Chiefs have 20000 warriors ready to take the field and have the strongest wish to act in conjunction with the English. They travelled 3000 miles before the reached Halifax and were near 12 months in performing the journey. From Halifax they went in an English frigate to Quebec to Lord Dorchester by whom they were sent over to England to concert their plans in person with the Ministry. The object of their coming to this country may be easily guessed at. They long to make an attack upon the Spanish settlements. One of them was heard last night in the playhouse to say he hoped in six months from this time to be in the heart of Mexico.  ID323,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,11,08,inform,Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Muskingum to his Friend in the City of Norwich (Connecticut) dated Nov. 24 1790. The prospect of peace from our frontiers seems to me to be vanished for the present; the troops from this garrison have this morning returned and the best account I can collect of the expedition is as follows: viz. the troops amounting to about 1200 militia and about 300 regulars after seventeen days march from Miami reached the great Miami village about 170 miles without any molestation except having a number of their pack-horse stole.–On their arrival they found the village deserted and all the valuable builder a short tarry they proceeded to neighings set on flames by the Indians. Afbouring villages without molestation and deftroyed five of them and a quantity of corn computed at fifteen thousand bushels which they found buried in different places and very large quantities of vegetables of every kind. The first opposition that was met with a party of about 150 Kentucky militia and thirty regular troops all under the command of Col. Hardin of Kentucky were detached from the main body lying in the great Miami village to pursue the track of a party of Indians which had the day before been discovered. After a pursuit of about six miles they came up with and were attacked by surprise by a body of Indians who were concealed in the thickets on every side of a large plain; and on the first onset the militia without exchanging a single fire made a most precipitate retreat and left the regular troops to stand the whole charge of the Indians; the conflict was short and bloody; the troops were soon overpowered by numbers and all fell except the two offiers and two or three privates after defending themselves at their bayonet points with the greatest possible obstinacy. Ensign Hartshorn of Franklin was one of the four that escaped and his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat and by that means screening himself from the eye of his pursuers that from any other circumstance. Captain Armstrong who commanded the party likewise made his escape by plunging himself into a pond or swamp up to his neck within two hundred yards of the field of action where he remained the whole night as a spectator of the horrid scene of the War Dance performed over the dead and wounded bodies of the poor soldiers that had fallen the preceding day where their shrieks mixed with the horrid yells of the savages rendered his situation shocking. After this some few skirmishes succeeded but nothing material until the second capital action which happened two days after the army left the Miami village. At ten miles distance from the town the General ordered a halt and detached from four to five hundred militia and about sixty regular soldiers commanded by Major Wylls all under the command of Col. Harden with orders to march back to the town. On their first entrance into the town there appeared a small body of Indians who immediately fled at the first onset and by that means decoyed the whole body of militia by making their flight into different directions and encouraging the militia to pursue; by this means the regular troops were left alone and the Indians had effected their design; for the moment they found the small handful of regular troops detached from the main body of militia they commenced the attack with their whole force excepting the flying parties that had diverted the militia; and although they soon found some part of the militia returning on their back pursued their object of routing and destroying the troops; as the only sure plan of success; which after the bloody conflict on each side they effect. The regular troops all to nine including two commissioned officers were killed and disabled and a total defeat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls of Hartford and Lieut. Frothingham of Middletown. Of the militia it is said about an hundred were killed among whom were a number of brave and valuable characters. The Indians it appears from some cause did not think it prudent to pursue their successes from the field of action for most of the troops that were not killed or sorely wounded made their escape which they never could have done had the Indians pursued with their usual fury. Nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the Indians on this occasion; the militia they appeared to despise and with all the undautedness conceivable threw down their guns and rushed upon the bayonets of the regular soldiers; a great number of them fell; but being so far superior in numbers soon overpowered them for while the poor soldier had his bayonet in one Indiaman two more would sink their tomahawks in his head. The defeat of our troops was complete the dead and wounded were left on the field in possession of the savages. No damage of any consequence has been sustained in this part of the country from the Indians; but what effect the expedition may have on us as relates to our frontier it uncertain.– If the Western Indians have any idea of treating for peace we shall be safe; if not we are much exposed.  ID324,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,21,inform,Extract of a letter from Norfolk (Virginia) Oct. 26. We learn from the West Country that the Kentucky Convention has determined in favour of a separation and large preparations are making in the country for offensive operations against the Indians who have committed so many murders and harassed the country so much that it can no longer be endured.

Wednesday Dec. 8. The SPEECH of George Washington Esq; President of the Congress on??? the ??? Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives I N meeting you again I feel much satisfac tion on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary. In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of 3000000 of florins towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in Holland.–As well theexchange with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information. Since your last sessions I have received communication by which it appears that the district of Kentucke at present a part of Virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honour to both the par ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you. It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity. These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended. The disturbed situation of Europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge in means and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil. Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection. The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom whether improvement of a judicatory system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom whether im provements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts be not desirable through all the States. The patronage of our commerce of our merchants and seamen has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect. The establishment of the Militia of a Mint of Standards of Weights and Measures of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favourite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents. Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives. In perusing the various and weighty business of the present session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.

United States Dec. 8 1790.  ID328,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,21,inform,The following it is said are the authentic particulars of General St Clair's expedition in America. The Miamis Indians had been for a long time extremely troublesome to the Americans and it was determined to drive them to the back country. General St. Clair completely accomplished this object; but on the 22d Oct. a detachment of 400 Americans fell in with the Indians on the River St. Joseph where a severe battle was fought. Many Indians were killed but the Americans lost the field; several Officers and 150 men were killed and they were not able even to bring off their wounded. This success will in all probability give the Indians new courage and induce them again to make head against the American army.  ID329,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,31,inform,Extract of a letter from Boston New England Dec. 11. The demands for the produce of America are most rapidly increasing: one single house has actuallyexported and sold within a very short time 2000 barrels of pot and pear ashes 2000 barrels of beef 500 ditto of pork 70000lb. weight of butter and 1500 bushels of bean and peas. Our news from New York is very disagreeable indeed. Gen. Scott Major Fountain Major Willis Capt. M'Murtry and Lieut.

The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men who instead of being mere lookers on in quality of overseers and drivers would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw is one of the most beautiful you can imagineabounding with everything that can make life comfortable besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of Sapola with rather more water than that of Charleston.

There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river the exportations of which in the opinion of rational men ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals and clays for the several colours of paint which may be had in any quantity and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal from every discovery we have been able to make are inexhaustible; all the samples however that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe and at a much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints there are none better in the world and in quantity when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river of property and enterprize are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature it is thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their attention. Extract of a letter from Charleston Sept. 27. On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard Hubcaw a fine new brig calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice the property of Mr. Hary Grant and is to be called the Pringle.

The fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the tavern keeper came in and advised us in a very warm manner to make a collection for the fiddler who had been scraping his cat gut several hours in our service; we apparently agreed and he well pleased with the success of his persuasion went for his hat to collect what we were willing to give. We took up an old newspaper tore it into small pieces which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern keeper goes round the room and we very gravely drop our paper in his hat. The fiddler returns and the landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self approbation boasts of what he had been doing for him; It was I persuaded them to make the collection I made them give I went round to every one and see what I have got. If it had not been for me–the fiddler examines his prize and discovers the cheat–he vents all his anger upon the poor landlord's shoulders who thus suffered for proclaiming himself the author of a project before its success was fully ascertained.  ID331,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,07,18,inform,A letter from Philadelphia??? that the most active preparations were making ??? ??? of the United States for recommencing the war with the Miami Indians.

Eleven men and two children were massacred two escaped and three were taken prisoners. Boston. The amount of the value of theexports from the United States for thirteen months agreeable to an estimate made at the Office of the Treasury in 20000000 dollars. The greatest apprehensions are entertained of an invasion from our savage neighbours; as accounts from Philadelphia state that there has been a confederation of all the South West Indians to fall on our frontiers early in the spring. Similiar apprehensions have driven the inhabitants in the country of Marcetta from their plantations into the city where they do military duty. According to the late Census the number of inhabitants in this commonwealth is 470000. Philadelphia April 7. Congress met here to-day and made a house Articles of the Constitution that were not liked by many of us are altered much for the better– among other things we were dissatisfied that not any notice was taken of Religion as we wanted it expressly declared that not any sect should ever be established in preference to another.–This is now done. In this part of the world we know not any thing of Toleration–all are equally free. It is said we have land for upwards of an hundred millions of people; we are yet about three so thatfor sometime we have have not any great cause to fight for territory.  ID336,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,05,13,inform,The Indian war in America is now become an object of considerable importance by the junction of several tribes of Indians hitherto??? with those already engaged in it. General Washington is expected to take the command of the army intended to serve against them in the present summer.  ID337,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,20,inform,Letters dated Halifax Feb 7 brought by the Schooner Joseph arrived at Glasgow say the Indians have beat the Americans in a second action in which 48 officers and 800 men were killed of the American army besides the loss of all their field pieces arms and stores. since this battle the Indians are increasing and become very powerful.  ID339,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,16,inform,From Philadelphia we learn that since the late defeat of the American forces by the Indians Congress have determined to maintain a standing army; but the number of troops of which it was to consist had not been ultimately determined.  ID340,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,06,21,inform,The brig Virginia Planter James Merrifield Master arrived at Liverpool brings information that on the 5th of May General Wayne with two thousand provincials had attacked totally destroyed most of the Indian towns at the back of Georgia for near two hundred miles around the river. That M'Gilvray and his army of savages after an unsuccessful and bloody engagement had fled to the woods where the General left them and returned to Savannah.– This expedition was undertaken about the beginning of March winch has been crowned with the expected catastrophe and though the Cherokee Miami and Chiquesaw tribes may mediate revenge at some future period; it is not likely they will be in a condition to disturb the settlers for some years to come.  ID341,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,02,22,inform,From the Jamaica Royal Gazette. Kingston Nov. 28. By late arrivals from Hispaniola we learn that the people are in quietness but still armed; and that the Governor who had been suffered to remain but the Intendent only having fled is perfectly submissive to the will of the people. For several days last week the weather at the north side and in some of the Liguanea Mountains blew in most alarming gusts and the cold is said to have been peculiarly sever; some plantain trees have been thrown down but we have yet heard of no material damage. The sloop Resolution has brought into port a part of his Majesty's 10th regiment of foot consisting of a serjeant and 29 privates having received them from on board the ship Commerce Foot from London off the East End on Thursday last the Commerce being destined for Savanna la Mar. Dec. 26. Late on Thursday evening his Majesty's ship Amphion Captain Nichols returned to Port-Royal from the Spanish American coast. The Amphion was bound to Carthagena but was prevented by the jealousy of the Spaniards from entering that port. Accounts are said to be received by her that a revolt has taken place amongst the Indians in that quarter and that the Spaniards are demolishing the fortifications throughout the country which it has cost them so much labour and expence to raise; so appre hensive are they of the numbers and force of the malcontents should they possess themselves of any of those strong holds. We learn from Georgia that the treaty with the Indians to negotiate with Commissioners were appointed by the President of the United States has been broken off; and that Mr. M'Gillivray and his warriors have declared that nothing short of a cession of the territory between the rivers St. Mary and Altamaha will satisfy them; adding that no equivalent can be given to the Georgians for relinquishing their claim to the district in question as it is founded in usurpation. The views of Mr. M'Gillivray in making this requisition are evident as it is known that he wishes to establish a sea-port at St Mary's as well for thecommercial emolument as for the civilization of his countrymen by an intercourse with foreign States.  ID342,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,07,12,inform,Letters from Alexandria in Virginia dated the 9th May last mention that General Wayne had been dispatched in the beginning of March on an expedition against the Cherokee Miamis and Chickesau Indians who have for some time past had as their chief warrior one Macgillivray a Scotchman who has long resided among these Indians. General Wayne at the head of two thousand Provincials had completely routed them after a great slaughter. After the battle Macgillivray and his savages took refuge in the woods. General Wayne has destroyed the most part of the habitation of these Indians in the extent of 200 English miles along the river which is the boundary of Georgia after which he returned to Savannah. This defeat is so total that it will put it out of the power of these Indians to be again troublesome to the State of Virginia.  ID343,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,06,18,persuade,The American States having now gained their independence have no cause of quarrel let with this country; but matters are very different between them and Spain. It is well known that the Indians on the back settlements have been regularly supplied with arms and ammunition from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies to enable them to distress the Americans and prove at least a hindrance to their growing prosperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi has been denied them?and the Spaniards now in possession of the Floridas have been continually quarrelling with them about their boundaries. It may therefore be considered as almost certain that the American states will take an active part against Spain. This will be a great acquisition to Britain in every point of view; for though American cannot furnish money she can furnish men and provisions; and afree intercourse with her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the security of our West-India Islands. Their privateers too will be able to take their runs so speedily that the Spanish trade must be very materially injured thereby.  ID344,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,05,17,inform,Kingston Feb. 6. By a St. Christopher's paper of the 25th ult. we learn that the small-pox raged lately at >Surinam to such a degree that within the space of two months upwards of 2500 persons had perished by that disorder. A very severe shock of an earthquake was felt between give and six on the evening of last Thursday se'ennight at the settlements near the Blue Mountains. On Wednesday the 3d instant arrived at Lucca the ship Pitt Captain Hunter from Africa with154 Gold-Coast Negroes. On the passage from Africa nine of the seamen mutined whom Captain Hunter has brought confined in irons and they are to be tried at a Court of Admiralty Sessions. Feb. 20. Very strong suspicions are entertained by the Americans that the Indian Chief M' Gilveray and the nations under his immediate controul or in alliance with him are subsidied by the King of Spain. It is a well known fact that they are regularly supplied with cloathing arms and ammunition from the Royal Magazines at St. Augustine and Pensacola and therefore in all probability; the sword not the olive branch will be the most speedy and effectual agent for terminating the disputes. March 6. Tuesday last arrived in the harbour of Port Royal from Cork his Majesty's ship Chichester of 44 guns armed en flute Lieutenant Craven Commander having on board the first battalion of the first or Royal Regiment of of foot commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Dundas. The other Officers are–Captains Duncan Franer Pemberton and Mannoch; Lieutenants Sir W. Jas. Cockburne Bart. Nicholson Puxley Clunes Browne Clarke Drummond and Graham; Adjutant Sir. W. J. Cockburne Bart. Quartermaster Mr. Davidson Surgeon MR. Young; Ma?e Mr. Bolton. The troops in the Chicester amount to 500 men exch??e of 100 women and children. Colonel Hunter is appointed superintendent of the settlement at the Bay of Honduras in the room of Colonel Despard recalled. Col. Hunter came out with the earl of Effingham; it is therefore probable that the disputes which have so long subsisted between Lieutenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of the Bay of Honoduras will be brought to a speedy determination. At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's estatea negro blacksmith was sold for the extraordinary sum of two hundred and sixty pounds! At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d regiment quitted the barracks in this town and at Up Park Camp and embarked on board the Chichester for Great Britain; the 14th at the same time taking possession of their quarters. Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispaniola that on the 1st of this month a number of free people of colour to the amount of 700 and upwards having possessed themselves of several field pieces formed a camp in that districh and exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarming. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent from the Assembly to demand the reason of so extraordinary a proceeding the insurgents demanded that a remonstrance which they then delivered to the deputies should be presented imimmediately to the general and that an answer thereto should be given without delay. The paper being conveyed as they desired proved to be a sensible and well written detail of the various claims the free people of colour had on what they termed the justice of the whites with whom they demanded an equal participation of all rights and immunities whatsoever–the privilege of representation and of qualifying for all the learned professions–and concluding with the avowal of a determination to proceed to extremities should their demands be treat with neglect. On the perusal of this paper it was judged adviseable to assemble a body of the militia who headed by the General immediately went against the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired and fled to the mountains; three or four of the whites were killed and one of the ringleaders was taken and instantly beheaded. A proclamation was then issued offering a reward of 50 half joes for the head of any principal offender and in the course of a few days not less than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday the 7th instant a very great majority of those who had formed the camp finding all their attempts completely frustrated came in and took the oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two of the principals for whom high rewards are offered are not yet taken. From Port Maria we have received the disagreeable account of the loss of the ship Lion Capt. Smith belonging to Liverpool: a violent breeze on the 5th instant drove her from her anchors and she now lies stranded on the beach.  ID345,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,05,24,entertain,NOOTKA SOUND. The circumstances of thetrade and situation of this part of North America being a matter of such general conversation and great public moment we are particularly happy in being enabled to give some further account of the transactions that have happened at Nootka Sounds as well as to point out the advantages that were likely to be extended to other places by the means of this trade. It is necessary to remark that the skin of the sea otter is worn only in the Northern regions of China. Its fur though beautiful and magnificent is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the Southern Provinces. Pekin is therefore the proper mart for this valuable commodity and in this immense city the consumption is so great that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale. The Mandarins of the Court and even the Emperor himself are fond of wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury. The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds that all the blankets cloths hats and stockings that could be procured in China if English manufacture were sold to the Indians with whose Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed. An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to be recorded. The Spaniards discovering that Callicum a Chief second in authority at Nootka Sound was in alliance with the English he was shot through the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife of Callicum with an infant child escaped but not till wounded. Macquilla the Chief first in command retired at the head of the allies of England from Nootka Sound and to avoid the cruelty of the Spaniards they fled to distant parts. Such of the natives as they could seize the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications. At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. And we further add on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain Mears the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines. Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of Kamschatka and other ports belonging to the Russians with the teas and other produce of China. This promised to be an invaluable channel of commerce as the Chinese have shut their ports against the Russians who On this voyage of discovery and experiment one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo but was unfortunately lost on her return to China. To these curious particulars we add with a patriot joy that the consumption of the glorious staple of England her broad cloths is astonishingly great in Japan and China: British hard ware &c. is also in great request. From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility. This Prince is six feet 4 1/2 inches high of proportionate bulk.  ID347,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,02,21,inform,Richmond Virginia Dec. 1 1790. Extract of a letter from a Gentleman at Kentucky to a Member of the General Assembly dated Nov. 7 1790. I have been waiting with much impatience to obtain some certain account of our troops; many probably conjectures still fill the minds of the people. A hand-bill just come to Bourbon contains an extract of a letter from Governor St. Clair to General Wilkinson which mentions that our army had met with but little opposition. The Miami villages were abandoned from thence a detachment was sent up to St. Joseph's river which fell in with a party of Indians and had a severe engagement. General Harmar made a shew of retreating and marched about eight miles when he detached a strong party to the field of action in hopes of finding the Indians on the ground; as they expected so they found them and an action immediately commenced which was obstinate on both sides. A vast number of Indians were killed in crossing the St. Joseph's river. Major Fountain of Fayette and General Scott's son were killed the second fire; Capt. M'Murty and 73 militiamen were killed; Major Willis Lieut. Fotheringham of the F–deral troops and 77 privates also fell in the action. General Harmar did not send a single man to reinforce the detachment consisting of 400 men (who had to sustain the fire of the whole Indian army) although he had with him in camp upwards of 1100 men. Our men at last lost ground Colonel Harding's wing was beaten and finally broke. Lieutenant Colonel Hall of Bourbon and Majors M'Million and Willis broke the other wing of the Indians which occasioned the amazing slaughter in the river St. Joseph. General Harmar never sent to bring off the wounded nor bury the dead. Captain David Thrope and Lieut. Clark fell in the field. The Bourbon militia has suffered very much nearly one third of them having fallen on the spot. The army is now at Licking and is expected home hourly. This is the best account that I have been able to collect; it will be delivered to you by Major Jones who before he leaves the district may be enabled to obtain further particulars.  ID348,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,02,21,inform,Musquito Shore. Intelligence has been received that in some trivial dispute with a native Indian a Spaniard has stabbed him to the heart with a stiletto and then fled. The nation to whom the Indian belonged being made acquainted with the murder sent a deputation to the Governor demanding that five Spaniards should be instantly delivered up as an attonement. This was peremptorily refused as being more than commensurate to the offence but the murderer was offered as a satisfaction; the Indians would not accept him singly and departed vowing the severest revenge: a few days afterwards intelligence was received that they had surprised and massacred sixteen men who had been at work in the woods; and when the vessel departed the Spaniards were flying with the utmost precipitation and terror from all parts of the country seeking shelter in the forts.  ID349,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,07,25,entertain,Norfolk April 11. This day arrived the ship Albion John Simmons master in 47 days from Rotterdam; on the 8th lying to in a heavy gale of wind the Albion shipped a sea which carried away all her boats and every loose article from the deck; there were three men of the watch one of whom is washed overboard and perished– his name is John M'Naught and belonged to Greenock. Extract of a letter from a gentleman at the falls of the Ohio to his relation inWinchester Virginia. dated April 13 1791. I wrote to you from Fort Pitt which place we left the 3d. inst. in company with two other boats and proceeded to Limestone without meeting or apprehending danger–at that place we were informed of several disasters which had befallen boats going down the river and one to a boat going up to a French station loaded with bacon butter &c. The particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing they gave the Indian whoop and rushing on the flankets scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat but did no damage as it required some time to make their way into the river. After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days five or six boats happened to come down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them in which were two young ladies of the name Macdonald a young gentleman and some others passengers and took it. Elevated with this easy capture they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight which they attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat as it came down and commenced firing; after discharging their guns they retreated loading and came on a second time fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two were killed and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat and prevent the Indians from boarding it which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ??? they threw billets of wood at them and one of them took up an ax as a weapon of defence should they persist in boarding which the Indians perceiving and as is supposed their ammunition being expended they retreated without accomplishing their object. These inhuman monsters previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes in which situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction they fired at another boat and killed one young man. In short every boat tat has gone down the river lately has been fired at except our's. We saw no Indians; the places where the above depredation happened we passed in the night. Boston May 4. It is supposed that the adventures of the town of Boston lost 25000 dollars in the late lottery; besides 'wear and tear' of conscience. Salem May 31.

A gentleman from the northward informs that the part at the British post lately holden in this state has recently been recalled. Baltimore May 27. Colonel Jacob Webb and Captain Miller formerly of Stamford in Concecticut Mr. John Carmel of Philadelphia merchant and several other gentlemen with a negro boy were drowned on the 9th of March last in St. Mary's river (Georgia) occasioned by the oversetting of a boat in a sudden flaw of wind. Boston May 25. On Friday last the venerable Mr. John Simonds of Salem entered the one hundredth year of his age. He is the only male person who has arrived at that great age from the first settlement of the town by the English in 1629 to the present day. New York June 9. General Washington on his tour to the Southern Sates landed at Charlestown South Carolina in a barge decorated for the purpose with colours and pendants and rowed by twelve American Captains and a Cockswain all dressed in blue silk jackets black silk breeches white stockings and blue roses to their shoes. They had likewife hold laced hats; with silk bandeaus with the motto Long live the President. An immense number of people assembled near the Quay and on board the vessels in the river which as well as works saluted him with several discharges of artillery. The day was afterwards devoted to conviviality–The lodge of St. John addressed his Excellency as follows:– Right Worshipful Sir We the Master Officers and Members of St. John's Lodge No. 2 of Newbern beg leave to hail you welcome with three times three ! We approach you not with the language works have proved you to be the true and faithful Brother the skilful and expert Craftsmen the just and upright Man. But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to express with sufficient energy the cordial warmth with which our bosoms glow towards you–We therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and devoutly pray that the Providence of the Most High may strengthen establish and protect you in your walk through life–and when you are called off from your terrestrial labours by command of our divine grand master and your operations sealed with the mark of his approbation may your soul be everlastingly refreshed with the streams of living water which flow from the right hand of God. And when the Supreme Architect of all world's shall collect his most precious jewels as ornaments of the Celestial Jerusalem–may you eternally shine among those of the brightest lustre. To which the President returned the following answer:– Gentlemen I receive the cordial welcome which you are pleased to give me with sincere gratitude. My best ambition having aimed at the unbiassed approbation of my fellow citizens it is peculiarly pleasing to find my conduct so affectionately approved by a fraternity whose association is founded on justice and benevolence. In reciprocating the kind wishes contained in your address be persuaded that I offer a sincere prayer for your present and future happiness. George-Town. April 30. Yesterday morning about one or two o'clock the ship Termagant belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen lying in the stream opposite this town was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting store and dwelling houses on the water side were prevented from sharing a similar fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse the property of Francis and Charles Loundes situated at some distance from the water wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stored was several times in different places on fire ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss occasioned by this alarming element must be great indeed as the ship was large and nearly new; besides there were goods to a considerable amount and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the money which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin which by some means or other set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost. Pittsburgh May 21. A letter received in this town on Sunday last from Lieut. Jeffers at Fort Franklin mentions that an Indian had arrived there who brought him intelligence that 300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations had set out for war and that they were determined to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio near Petersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing but their destination was not known.  ID351,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,08,17,inform,By private letters and newspapers lately arrived from Philadelphia and New York we have informmation that the Indians are carrying on their depredations on the back settlements of the United States with great vigour; that an enquiry as to the miscarriage of the war had been made by Congress and an army was collected this year; that the Americans had some expectations of getting free of the Indian war by treaties. We have advices of Governor Clinton's being re-elected Governor of New York state by a majority of 180 but the friends of Mr. Tay were objecting to the return as the canvassers had not opened the boxes which contained the returns from three counties Otsego Clinton and Tioga which if opened they say would have given the election to Mr. Tay the county of Otsego alone being 300 majority in favours of Mr. Tay. A dreadful storm happened at New York on the 1st of July which continued with so much violence that several vessels were driven from their moorings and a number of boats upset and many lives lost.  ID352,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,08,20,inform,Extract of a letter from New York??? A complete overthrow has lately been given to a numerous body of Indians commanded by one of their greatest Warriors who was left dead on the field amongst many hundreds of his followers. The attack was commenced on the morning of the 28th of June by a company of Regulars under the command of Lieutenant Morton of New York aided by a number of the neighbouring inhabitants; and after a contest of three hours put them totally to the rout. The carnage was general amongst the Indians and no quarter given as it might operate as a terror in future to those savage Freebooters whose depredations on the property of every description of individuals and oftentimes??? with personal cruelty to those in their power has exasperated the Communities to the highest pitch of vengeance and retaliation when an opportunity offered.  ID353,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,12,14,inform,Extract of a letter from Philadelphia dated Nov. 1. Advice received from Governor Blount dated the latter end of September informs us that the Cherokees of the five lower towns on the Tenesee headed by John Watts and Esquaka or the bloody fellow has declared war against the United States and that the warriors according to various authentic accounts amount to near 600 including about one hundred banditti Creeks; another letter mentions that the above force had actually set out on some expedition against the frontiers; it is feared they will fall first on Cumberland settlement.  ID354,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,10,08,entertain,Extract of a letter from Luxene County. On Saturday the 1st of July I left Tioga point near the middle of the day; about half after one o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising from the north west and I had scarcely time to take shelter in the house of Obadiah Gore Esq; at Sheshequen before the storm came on attended with heavy thunder and lightening and a violent gale of wind with rain. The storm continued up wards of half an hour during which time to see the tumbling of timber during the storm was surprising. After it abated I continued on my journey but found it very difficult travelling in many places the road being blocked up by the falling of timber. I reached Wilksbarree on Wednesday. It appears that the storm extended through the country and at the same hour of the day blew more violent in some places than others. At Exeeter about nine miles from Wilksbarrie a level plain loaded with pitch pine timber was swept of its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile in length and three fourths of a mile wide being either torn up by the roots or twisted off leaving their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high. A number of buildings in different parts of the country stript of their roofs and otherways damaged–fences in many place removed and many fields of corn others grain and flax laid level with the earth–cattle killed by the falling of timber in every part of the country. A Mr. –Lot who lived at Mahooper about 35 miles from Wilksbarre whose family consisted of his wife and a number of children– he with his wife being absent children seeing themselves in danger in the house left it at the instant a large tree was falling; the tree reached them a small distance from the door and a girl about eleven years of age was crushed to pieces about expired instantly. One of the other children had a thigh and both arms broke another badly wounded in the head–these two it is feared has received the fatal blow two other slightly wounded. Extract of a letter from Richmond Virginia dated July 28. By accounts from Kentucky we are informed that about the 1st of this month a party of Indians appeared near Frankfort and took a great number of horses and negroes. Col. M'Dowell with 300 men pursued them to the Ohio; but not falling in with them he crossed the river leaving 100 men to take care of his horses; after marching about 12 or 15 miles overtook a large party when a severe engagement ensued but being overpowered by numbers was obliged to retreat. He then sent for the men left behind and came up with the Indians the next day and after engaging some time obliged them to make a precipitate retreat. Col. M'Dowell took six Indian warriors two Englishmen and a Frenchman from Detroit and all the negroes and horses. Newtown June 27. On the 13th instant the meeting house in Newtown was removed about eight rods the removal was effected in one hour and an half after previous preparations for the purpose had been made. The house is between 70 and 80 feet long and about 50 feet wide with a steeple at one end; the whole of which was removed entire with the least injury to any part.  ID366,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,01,24,inform,Letters from Quebec dated Nov. 17 say that every thing was quiet in that province. Some letters from Quebec were on Saturday received at the General Post Office which state that the American army under the command of General Wayne had been routed by the Otoway Indians; an advanced party of 200 men had been entirely cut off: his army consisted of 400 regulars and 2000 volunteers.  ID369,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,11,inform,As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at the opening of the Congress of the United States at New York Nov. 6 gives an impartial account of the situation of that counttry we are persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives IT is some aba???of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally I am not able to add to it information that Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our western frontier have terminated. You will I am persuaded learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of preserving hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the further effusion of blood–to arrest the progress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable puposes:–In making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the events or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable; to ascertain unequivocally the such is the case. A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thu s far will I trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them indeed is still depending; but a favourable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by any thing that has yet happened. In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will I presume be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased. It must add to your concern to be informed what besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it. A part of the Cherokees known by the name of Chickamagas inhabiting five villages on the ??? river have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements. It was hoped that the treat of Holston made with the Cherokee nation in July 1791 would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unproved hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter. I have reason to believe that every predictable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete. And pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termintion of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable. In looking forward to the future expence of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year. This however will be better ascertained in the course of the session; and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds from the supposition of no material extention of the spirit of hostilities. I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all ??? plans must prove nugatory. To enable by ???ent rewards the employment of qualified ??? persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoing civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulation calction its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable. The prosperous state of our revenue had been intimated–This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in someplaces continue to embarrass the collection of??? duties on spirits distilled within the United States. These impediments have lessened and are?ess???d in local extent; and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the lawapp??? to be progressive. But symptoms of increased opposition have lately manifested themselves in certain quarters; I judged special interposition on my part proper and adviseable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for this object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in excution for bring to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto. Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders. And Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend on me shall be wanting???sert and maintain the just authority of the law. In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full co-operation of the other departments of the government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens. I cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are being experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the structure of that system which some cases??? to relax their efficacy. As connected with the subject provisions to facilitate the raking of??? upon processes out of the Courts of the United States and supplementary definition of offence against the constitution and laws of the union??? of the punishment for such offences will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention. Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary; I would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition??? give that satisfaction to foreign nations which??? may sometimes have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your considerations the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations as other infractions of the law of nations which furnishes just subject of complaint might endanger our own peace with them. And in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention??? expiration of the law for that purpose which taken place if not re??? at the close of the present session. In execution of the authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engagement of our mint–others have been employed at at home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings and therefore now putting into proper condition for the purpose of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half-dollars; the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them. The regulation of some provision in the law which establishes the Post Office open to in experiment against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should that upon the enquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and infor mation will I doubt not lead to the application of a remedy. The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky has been notified to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order. It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for three millions of florins—one at Antwerp at the annual interest of four and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all charages.–The rates of these loans and the circumstance under which they have been made ar confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad. Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effecttual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the government –no measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation. Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made for the Bank of the United States pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made. Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and I doubt not engage your early attention. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives I content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you. Various temporary laws will expire during the present sesssion. Among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will merit your particular notice. The results of your common deliberations hitherto will I trust be productive of solide and durable advantages to our constituentes; such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strength and confirm their attachment upon which under Divine Providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness. Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivatino of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils. G. WASHINGTON.  ID370,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,09,17,inform,EXTRACTS FROM LATE NEWSPAPERS. New York July 5. This city and its vicinity were exceedingly alarmed last Sabbath about four o'clock M. P. by a tremendous westerly tornado which continued about 20 minutes twisting off limbs of trees unroofing houses and tumbling down chimneys in various parts of the city. Unused to such unruly gusts the citizens particularly the fair were thrown into a momentary d???ation. Terrible was the havoc on the water–in vain did the Sabbath breakers cry for mercy–in a moment in the twinkling of an eye were they hurried to the bottom and melancholy was the scene. It is said that 29 persons lost their lives in this neighbourhood but we have not been able to ascertain who they were for certainty. Report says that a Mr. Wade his wife and two of their children his brother and a young man were all except the last mentioned drowned from one boat near Yellow Hook a few miles from the city. It is also said a sloop overset with 16 persons all but one of whom were drowned. We learn that the??? extended to Philadelphia that ship was driven from her moorings there and sunk and that the road from thence to this city shrewn violent tokens of its visitation. July 14. The society for promoting the manufacture of maple sugar met at Albany July 3 have granted 75 dollars bounty to Thaddeus Scribner of Herkermer county for having produced 600 lb. of grained maple sugar of superior quality– of 50 dollars to Comfort Cook of Otsego for producing sugar of equal quality but a less quantity –and of 25 dollars to J. Harris and R. Huntley of Saratoga county for the third rate quantity. The society resolved to exhibit samples from each of these parcels to the legislature at their text session in order to induce them to give larger bounties for the further encouragement of this important manufacture. Aug. 4. On Saturday last arrived in this city directly from Scotland.–Nesbit Esq. a gentleman who comes warmly recommended by the celebrated Dr. Robinson and several other literary characters of eminence in that country as a master of the science of canaling from several years experience both in Holland and in Scotland. The President of the Northern Inland L.?. Company attended by Mr. Nesbit and a commitee of Directors left this city this morning on a tour to explore the rive from Troy upwards for the purpose of prosecuting the canals with spirit the remaining part of the season and making preparations for its more active prosecution in the ensuing year. Philadelphia July 12. Accounts from South Carolina and Georgia with regard to their prospects of the ensuing crops are very unfavourable no rains of any consequence having fallen in the more eastern disctricts of these states since the beginning of April; at which time the low country was in a manner inundaed. The Indigo plantations when the last vessels sailed were almost despaired of for the next crop and the rice swamps promised not much better. July 18. We are sorry to learn from New York that spirit of party respecting a late election of Governor of the State has arisen to such a height as to have occasioned several duels a week. On Thursday morning last Colonel W??? and Mr. Wilcocks both of New York had a meeting and exchanged pistol shot but their friends in??? prevented any bad consequences.–Colonel Willet is friendly to Governor Clinton's election which Mr. Wilcock opposes. We hear from Maryland that a number of gentlmen of the state are about establishing a society in Port-To??? for the dissemination of useful political knowledge the study of the constitution of their country and the keeping up among the people if possible a knowledge of their rights as free citizens of the greatest and perhaps the only true republic in the universe. August 6. On Thursday morning was witnessed a very melancholy event at Mr. Henry Kizer's power mill in lower Merion township Montgomery country between the hours of 9 and 10. There was a large quantity of powder in the mill which by accident took fire and blew up with a great explosion which was heard at Schuylkill ferry and was there supposed to be an earthquake. Mr Kizer and three others who were in the mill were blown to pieces; and a Mr. Henry Fraily a copartner of Mr. Kizer was so wounded that his life is dispared of. A young woman who happened to be near the mill at the time it blew up had both her legs broken and was otherwise very much injured by one of the rafters which was carried from the building in the violence of the explosion. Petersburgh July10. We learn from North Carolina that a fire broke out in the town of Washington on Wednesday the 27th ult. which burn nearly half the town.–The loss in houses goods &c. is said to be very considerable. ???sburgh July 21. Extract of a letter from Captain Paul of the State Levies dated Middle Block house of the frontiers of Washington country July 16 1792. The Indians on Tuesday last killed two men and one woman and stole seven horses between the states of Crays Creek and Col. Shepherd's in Ohio county Virginia.–Lieut. Gray and fourteen of my men followed them over the Ohio as far as the head of the Soufish but the Indians being on horseback they returned without coming up with them. On Saturday last at Dilly's station opposite the mouth of Grave creek the Indians came into one of the houses and killed four and wounded one; the number of Indians was suppos ed to be twenty. It is thought they will strike this quarter. To-morrow morning I intend to start with a party to try and fall in with them. Martinsburgh July 24. We are informed that one day last week a Mr. Barret living near the South Branch accidentally shot his wife;–he was fixing a flint to his gun and incautiously dragging the trigger not knowing the gun was loaded discharged the whole contents into her body and she died in a few moments after–the unfortunate woman had a young child at her breast but it providentially received no injury. Alexander M'Gillivray advertises for a tutor willing to instruct Indian children in the rudiments of the English language; and the first principles ofarithmetic.

They had been met at Niagara by Indian commissioners and with them had sailed in separate vessels to the mouth of Detroit river 18 miles from Detroit where our commissioners were directed to remain until an asswer should be brought from the great council of Indian nations assembled at the rapids of the Miami and the Lake. On the 2d of August an answer was brought to this effect that the only terms onw hich peace could be made was our ceding the country on the west of the Ohio and Allegheny rivers. The commissioners suggested the impossibilities of doing this as the lands had been sold by the Congress and people had settled on them but that the United States would be willing to give more goods than they had given at any other time. The Indians replied that if the Congress would give one half these goods to the people that had settled the would leave the land and remove the difficulty. Our commissioners replied that the land they must have and would not give it up. The Indians said it was well and there need no more be said. However desired them to remain if they thought proper until they returned to the council and laid this before them. On the 16th of August two Indians came and informed that the final result of their deliberations was the country in question or war. The express is of opinion from the language of individual Indians in private and from other circumstances that the British wholly conduct their council and dictate their demands. By the arrival of some person from Fort Washington on Monday last we are informed that the Indians still contiue hovering about our garrisons and occasionally stealing horses that the army is in high spirits anxiously waiting the event of the treaty and hoping that a campaign will take place as no idea of peace is entertained by any one; that the greatest pains has been taken by the commander in chief in training his men in the act wood fighting and that from their proficiency and the???imity prevailing throughout the whole army success may be expected should a campaign take place. New York Sept. 17. A Mr. Spier was removed from his lodgings in this city on Sunday last to Governors Island where he died this morning. He arrived from Philadelphia last Thursday was seized with Fever on Friday.–The Doctors pronounced it the malignant putrid fever and the event prov ed their opinion to be just. According to a list published of the births and deaths in the several religious societies of Philadelphia it appears that from August 1 1792 to August 1 1793 the Births amounted to 2511 and the Death to 1467. Philadelphia Sept. 21. The stages for New-York returned to this city with all the passengers (mortified and fatigued.) One of the drivers had a very narrow escape with his life being cruelly fired upon at Trenton; the ball passing within a few inches of his head! The ladies &. have been without any refreshment on the road as the panic and terror with which every mind is possessed by the writings and measures above alluded to prevented their obtaining any accommodations on the road– O tell it not in Gath! declare it not in the streets of Askelon ! Ye New Yorkers and ye Baltimorians you have been generous to strangers; but forgot the charitable and fraternal attention due to your own fellow-citizens! Sept. 25. Extract of a letter from a gentleman who lately left his city on his way to the southward. We were stopped about seven miles from Baltimore by armed men who used us with every indignity and hatred truly indicative of malice prepense. These detained us in the stage from five to the afternoon until ten the ensuing morning; during this interval one of these ruffians who appeared to be a German snapped his piece at one of this party who seemed inclined to leave the stage with an apparent design to go among the bushes nears the road; this guard in their tender mercy wre pleased to hand us a piece of dry cheese on the end of a pitch-fork. After this quarantine we were permitted to go to Gray's Garden and there to perform another for the space of two days and nights. New-York Sept. 28. Extract of a letter from Philadelphia to a gentleman in Baltimore dated the 20th instant. You request I would endeavour to give you a parti cular account of the state of the city in general and the rise and progress of the malignant fever now raging here. I believe it will be difficult precisely to determine its origin; but it is generally admitted to have been imported from Cape-Francois in a vessel which came to a wharf betwen Arch and Race-street beause the infection broke out ina house connected with that vessel and it was afterwards traced to that vessel. The disorder overtook several families thereabouts. But most people apprehended it to be the general fall-fever which acted severly on those who had the influenza–To that there was no material danger apprehended until the death of Peter Ashton in Vine-street who after a short illness died about one month past; after which the disorder was clearly discovered to be the putrid or yellow fever and each person became after of his neighbours insomuch that if any became sick they were avoided and many fled from the sick leaving them in adestitute situation perhaps shut up in a house and the neighbours alarmed merchants and housekeepers moved into the country and fear was stamped on every countenance–infirmness possessed the hearts of the people–little business was done except packing up–engaging waggons to move goods into the country and searching for shelter for their families; many families set off without having a particular place to go to. Thus the country became alarmed. Individuals died in the country–but I cannot learn ?hat it spread there. The overseers duty became exceedingly heavy and several of them were taken sick; others abandoned their post and the business bore very hard on the remaining few. Finding deaths increasingly abundantly they procured carpenters to make coarse coffins by the do???. The malady still increasing in Water Front Race and Vine-street threatened desolation in those quarters. The overseers moved by the distresses of the helpless took possession of Bush-Hill mansion (it being empty) and erected a hospital employed some physicians and nurses; sent out some accomadations and provided for interring the dead. The overseers became inadequate to the business by reason fo fear; few in number and the funds exhausted; added to this the extravagant wages of the nurses two and three dollars per day most of the magistrates fled; the house of employment and hospital shut their doors against all indigent and indisposed persons. Thus were the people who had been private patientes on the poor list abandoned and had no sheltering place and those who were slightly indisposed were sent to Bush-Hill and became victims with many others. The inhabitants were requested to meet by public advertisement and a committee of 40 was appointed to take charge of the Bush-Hill hospital and to relieve the distressed in the city and its vicinity they became organized Ianto693 negociated a loan in the bank two of the number voluntarily offered their service to see the business of Bush-Hill properly conducted; bedsteads were procured the house cleaned matrons appointed and nurses under their direction; an apothecary with medicine &c. and four physicians to attend once a day. The remainder of the committee attend at the State House receive information from the committee at Bush - Hill and supply their demands; receive all sheets shirts &c. &c. at the State-House also keep a supply of ready made coffins to furnish as occasion required. Several carts are procured for the various purposes of carrying out the sick whom the doctors pronounce to have the fever of disposing the corpsand for carrying provisions and other necessaries to and from the hospital. THere is also a house fitted up and under the care of a matron to be for the use of those children whose parents have died with the fever; as all their relations and neighbours are shy of them; the governor has directed the State Treasury to be open for their use and they to be accountable to him for their expenditures.–The city seems quite solitary and business at a stand; deaths numerous and no parade at the interment of any; the bells do not ring nor is there any invitations to the funeral of any. I think about 1000 have died since the disorder first made its appearance but it cannot be ascertained with precision; and we think between 15 and 20000 removed from their habitations. The doctors suppose the disorder a little checked by the cool weather; how that is I know now. By a passenger arrived from Albany this morning we learn that in order to prevent the introduction of the Yellow Fever in Albany they have formed Committees and fixed a Gun-Boat at some distance from the city where all vessels are stopt till the Doctors examine the passengers– And that Colonel Hamilton and Lady were arrived but were denied admittance into the city and had taken lodgings at a Mr. M'Gown's at Green-Bush. October 2. Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadelphia to the Printers of this PAper dated September 28. The papers must have amply informed you of the melancholy situation of this city for five or six weeks past. Grave digging has been the only business carrying on; and ndeed I may say of late Pit digging where people are interred indiscriminately in three tiers of coffins. From the most accurate observations I can make upon matters I think I speak within bounds when I Say eighteen hundred persons have perished (I do not say all of the yellow fever) since its first appearance on the 3d of August in North Water-street; others think a larger number–but I confess we are a good deal in the dark on the subject at present and it will take some time to have accurate returns made. People have been hitherto so panic struck that little has been attnded to but the means of self-preservation; gloom and melancholy is on every persons countenance; nothing but the yellow fever is talked of; the street are often seen without a passenger; the wharfs are deserted the markets miserable and uncommonly high and nearly one half the citizens departed. The city is truly republican; pomp and distinction have in a great measure disadpeared and bad Plato himself come among us to preach up the practice of true republicansim his lectures could not have had a greater effect upon the minds of men than the present mortality. We make use of no other precaution for avoiding the contagion than not going into infected houses–keeping our own well aired clean and frequently having the walls white-washed. considering the general terro I have more than once felt my pulse to discover whether I was really alive or not; however I now begin to hoep we may escape as cool weather is fast approaching and one-street in general healthy. Of all things this yellow fever is the most insidious– its approaches are generally gradual–a person imagines himself well when he is dying–other loss the use of reason entirely and die in that situations. with those few that recover its effects are long left. It acts like a steeltrap–when once it gets hold of a person it does not easily let him get off. Philadelphia Oct. 7. Died of Sunday the 29th ult. Samuel Powell Esq. Speaker of the Senate of this commonwealth a gentleman of a benevolent disposition an improved mind a sound understanding and an honest heart. Died on Friday evening after a short illness with the present maligant fever at Mrs. Grant's–Mr Chase a yong gentleman of respectable connections of Baltimore. Winchester Sept. 20. Extract of a letter from our correspondent at??? Creek Territory South of the Ohio dated Sept. 4. Times here were but a gloomy aspect. The???le daily harassed by the Indians. On the 27th of August a party consisting of about 300 killed Lieut. Janks Tedford of the United States troops and a Mr. JAckson as they were gathering corn in a field for their horses near Henry's stations–They have lately burnt many houses on the Nine Mile and destroyed a prodigious quantity of wheat rye and corn. WE hope Governor Blount on his return to this territory will be invested with power to desstroy these barbarous tribes. From the same dated Sept. 14. On the 30th of August some Indians killed one young woman and scalped another in Washington county; and on the 5th instant a part of them wounded four persons and scalped one about nine miles from Green Court - House; a house was also attacked by them but they were forced to retreat by the owner thereof and one of his daughters who fired several rounds and wounded some of them. On the 16th another party of the savages killed a woman and child on Nine-Mile. New-York Oct. 16. Monday evening last a number of persons assembled in the fields when they commenced the demolition of Mother Cay's house which in a short time was intirely resed to the ground floor; the furniture beds clothing &c. were all destroyed. another house of ill fame tenanted by Mother Giles under went a similar fate. It is aid that three persons were wounded one dangerously from the firing of small arms by some persons who were placed in the house for its defence.–We lament that our worthy Mayor received some injury in endeavouring to disperse the people.  ID373,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,01,27,inform,FEDERAL LEGISLATURE. House of Representatives. Dec. 3. THE Secretary of the Senate announced that the Members of the Senate were ready to admit the Members of the House of Representatives in the Senate Chamber in order to receive the President's communication. FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Since the commencement of the term for which I have been again called into office no fit occasion has arisen for expressing to me fellow citizens at large the deep and respectful sense which I feel of the renewed testimony of public approbation. While on the one hand it awakened my gratitude for all those instances of affectionate partiality with which I have been honoured by my country; on the other it could not prevent an earnest wish for that retirement from which no private consideration should ever have torn me. But influenced by the belief that my conduct would be estimated according to its real motives; and that the people and the authorities derived from them would support exertions having nothing personal for their object I have obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the executive power; and I humbly implore that Being on whose will the fate of nations depends to crown with success our mutual endeavors for the general happiness. As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom the United States have the most extensive relations there was reason to apprehend that our intercourse with them might be interrupted and our disposition for peace drawn into question by the suspicions too often entertained by belligerent nations. It seemed therefore to be my duty to admonish our citizens of the consequences of a contraband trade and of hostile acts to any of the parties; and to obtain by a declaration of the existing legal state of things an easier admission of our right to the immunities belonging to our situation. Under these impressions the proclamation which will be laid before you was issued. In this posture of affairs both new and delicate I resolved to adopt general rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the privileges of the United States. These were reduced into a system which will be communicated to you. Although I have not thought myself at liberty to forbid the sale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of commerce with France to be brought into our ports; I have not refused to cause them to be restored when they were taken within the protection of our territory or by vessels commissioned or equipped in a warlike form within the limits of the United States. It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct improve or enforce this plan of procedure; and it will probably be found expedient to extend the legal code and the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States to many cases which though dependent on principles already recognized demand some further provisions. Where individuals shall within the United States array themselves in hostility against any of the powers at war or enter upon military expeditions or enterprizes within the jurisdiction of the United States; or where the penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been indistinctly marked or are inadequate; those offenses cannot receive too early and close an attention and require prompt and decisive remedies. Whatsoever those remedies may be they will be well administered by the judiciary who possess a long-established course of investigation effectual process and officers in the habit of executing it. In like manner as several of the courts have doubted under particular circumstances their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peace and even of a citizen of the United States although seized under a false colour of being hostile property; and have denied their power to liberate certain captures within the protection of our territory; it would seem proper to regulate their jurisdiction in these points. But if the executive is to be the resort in either of the two last mentioned cases it is hoped that he will be authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courts when for his own information he shall request it. I can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of our duties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the necessity of placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense and of exacting from them the fulfillment of their duties toward us. The United States ought not to indulge a persuasion that contrary to the order of human events they will for ever keep at a distance those painful appeals to arms with which the history of every other nation abounds. There is a rank due to the United States among nations which will be withheld if not absolutely lost by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult we must be able to repel it; If we desire to secure peace one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity it must be known that we are at all times ready for war. The documents which will be presented to you will shew the amount and kinds of arms and military stores now in our magazines and arsenals; and yet an addition even to these supplies cannot with prudence be neglected as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuring a warlike apparatus in the moment of public danger. Nor can such arrangements with such objects be exposed to the censure or jealousy of the warmest friends of Republican Government. They are incapable of abuse in the hands of the militia who ought to possess a pride in being the depository of the force of the Republic and may be trained to a degree of energy equal to every military exigency of the United States. But it is an enquiry which cannot be too solemnly pursued whether the act more effectually to provide for the national defense by establishing an uniform militia throughout the United States has organized them so as to produce their full effect; whether your own experience in the several States has not detected some imperfections in the scheme; and whether a material feature in an improvement of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity for the study of those branches of the military art which can scarcely ever be attained by practice alone. The connection of the United States with Europe has become extremely interesting. The occurrences which relate to it and have passed under the knowledge of the Executive will be exhibited to Congress in a subsequent communication. When we contemplate the war on our frontiers it may be truly affirmed that every reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissension with the Indians north of the Ohio. The instructions given to the Commissioners evince a moderation and equity; proceeding from a sincere love of peace and a liberality having no restriction but the essential interests and dignity of the United States. The attempt however of an amicable negotiation having been frustrated the troops have marched to act offensively. Although the proposed treaty did not arrest the progress of military preparation it is doubtful how far the advance of the season before good faith justified active movements may retard them during the remainder of the year. From the papers and intelligence which relate to this important subject you will determine whether the deficiency in the number of troops granted by law shall be compensated by succors of militia or additional encouragements shall be proposed to recruits. An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive for peace with the Creeks and the Cherokees. The former have been relieved with corn and with clothing and offensive measures against them prohibited during the recess of Congress. To satisfy the complaints of the latter prosecutions have been instituted for the violences committed upon them. But the papers which will be delivered to you disclose the critical footing on which we stand in regard to both those tribes; and it is with Congress to pronounce what shall be done. After they shall have provided for the present emergency it will merit their most serious labours to render tranquillity with the savages permanent by creating ties of interest. Next to a rigorous execution of justice on the violators of peace the establishment of commerce with the Indian nations in behalf of the United States is most likely to conciliate their attachment. But it ought to be conducted without fraud without extortion; with constant and plentiful supplies; with a ready market for the commodities of the Indians and a stated price for what they give in payment and receive in exchange. Individuals will not pursue such a traffic unless they be allured by the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the United States to be reimbursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the opinion of Congress they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by any means yet in the hands of the Executive. GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The commissioners charged with the settlement of the accounts between the United and Individual States concluded their important function within the limited time by law; and the balances struck in their report which will be laid before congress have been placed on the books of the Treasury. On the 1st day of June last an installment of on million of florins became payable on the loans of the United States in Holland. This was adjusted by a prolongation of the period of reimbursement in nature of a new loan at an interest of five per cent. for the term of ten years; and the expenses of this operation were a commission of three per cent. The first installment of the loan of two millions of dollars from the Bank of the United States has been paid as was directed by law. For the second it is necessary that provision be made. No pecuniary consideration is more urgent than the redemption and discharge of the public debt: On none can delay be more injurious or an economy of time more valuable. The productiveness of the public revenues hitherto has continued to equal the anticipations which were formed of it; but it is not expected to prove commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested. Some auxiliary provisions will therefore it is presumed be requisite: and it is hoped that these may be made consistently with a due regard to the convenience of ourcitizens who can not but be sensible of the true wisdom of encountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviate a future accumulation of burdens. But here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the transportation of public prints. There is no resource so firm for the government of the United States as the affections of the People guided by an enlightened policy; and to this primary good nothing can conduce more than a faithful representation of public proceedings diffused without restraint throughout the United States. An estimate of the appropriations necessary for the current service of the ensuing year and a statement of a purchase of arms and military stores made during the recess will be presented to Congress. GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The several subjects to which I have now referred open a wide range to your deliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of our common country. Permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude of your task:–Without an unprejudiced coolness the welfare of the government may be hazarded; without harmony as far as consists with freedom of sentiment its dignity may be lost.–But as the legislative proceedings of the United States will never I trust be reproached for the want of temper or of candour so shall not the public happiness languish from the want of my strenuous and warmest cooperation. GEORGE WASHINGTON. Philadelphia Dec. 3 1793 The President having withdrawn the Members of the House of Representatives returned to their Chamber where the President's Address was read and referred to a Committee to report the draft of an answer. A Committee was then appointed to report the unfinished business of the last House.–Adjourned. Thursday Dec. 5. The Journal of the Commissioners for treating with the Indians was read. It is minute and lengthy. The definitive answer of the Indians contains their reasons for rejecting the proposals of the Commissioners drawn up in a masterly manner it bears all the appearance of EUropean logic faintly clad in an Indian dress. All the documents relative to this business were referred to a Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. A message was received from the President communication sundry papers relative to our European relations and also the result of the proceedings of the Commissioners appointed to settle the accounts of the United States with the Individual States. The first set of papers is introduced by a message of which the following is a copy: United States Dec. 5 1793 GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES As the present situations of the several nations of Europe and especially of those with whom the United States have important relations cannot but render the state of things between them and us; matter of interest ing enquiry to the Legislature and may indeed give rise to deliberations to which they alone are competent I have thought it my duty to communicate them certain correspondencies which have taken place. The Representatives and Executive Bodies of France have manifested generally a friendly attachment to this country; have given advantages to our commerce and navigation and have made overtures for placing these advantages on permanent ground; a decree however of the National Assembly subjecting vessels laden with provisions to be carried into their ports and making enemy goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend contrary to our treaty though revoked at one time as to the United States has been since extended to their vessels also as has been recently stated to us. Representations on this subject will be immediately given in charge to our Minister there and the result shall be communicated to the Legislature. It is with extreme concern I have to inform you that the proceedings of the person whom they have unfortunately appointed their Minister Plenipotentiary here have breathed nothing of the friendly spirit of that nation which sent him; their tendency on the contrary has been to involve us in a war abroad; and discord and anarchy at home. So far as his acts or those of his agents have threatened our immediate commitment in the war or flagrant insult to the authority of the laws their effect has been counteracted by the ordinary cognizance of the laws and by an exertions of the powers confided to me. Where their danger was not imminent they have been born with from sentiments of regard to his nation from a sense of their friendship towards us from a conviction that they would not suffer us to remain long exposed to the action of a person who has so little respectedour mu tual dispositions and I will add from a reliance on the firmness of my fellow citizens in their principles of peace and order. In the mean time I have respected and pursued the stipulations of our treaties according to what I judge the true sense; and have withheld no act of friendship which their affairs have called for from us and which justice to others let us free to perform. I have gone further;–rather than employ force for the restitution of certain vessels which I deemed the United States bound to restore I thought it more advisable to satisfy the parties by avowing it to be my opinion that if restitution were not made it would be incumbent on the United States to make compensation. The papers now communicated will more particularly apprize you of these transactions. The vexations and spolitation understood to have been committed on our vessels and commerce by the cruizers and officers of some of the belligerent powers appeared to require attention. The proofs of these however not having been brought forward the description of citizens supposed to have suffered were notified that on furnishing them to the Executive Power due measures would be taken to obtain redress of the past and more effectual provisions against the future. Should such documents be furnished proper representations will be made thereon with a just resistance on a redress proportioned to eh exigency of the case. The BRitish Government having undertaken by orders to the commanders of their armed vessels to restrain generally our commerce in corn and other provisions to their own ports and those of their friends the instructions now communicated were immediately forwarded to our Minister at that court. In the mean time some discussionson the subject took place between him and them; these are also laid before you; and I may expect to learn the result of his special instructions in time to make it known to the legislature during their present sessions. Very early after the arrival of a British Minister here mutual explanation on the execution of the Treaty of Peace were entered into with that Minister; these are now laid before you for your information. On the subjects of mutual interest between this country and Spain negociations and conferences are now depending. The public requiring that the present state of those should be made known to the legislature in confidence only they shall be the subject of a separate and subsequent communication. G. WASHINGTON Mr. Madison reported the draft of an Answer to the Address of the President. The remainder of this sitting was employed in beginning the reading of the papers received from the President which are voluminous.  ID374,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,07,18,inform,Winchester May 19. Two men named Timmons brothers as also one Nimrod Higgins were killed in the wilderness between Yellow Creek and Cumberland Mountain about the 20th ult. by Indians. Three persons were also lately killed by Indians in Harrison county near the mouth of the Little Kennaway. By a letter from the territory south of the Ohio dated April 25 we learn that on the 22d of that month a large party of Indians killed sever person within seven miles of Knoxville and stole 60 horses from Knox County; that parties of them are daily committing ravages in the territory and that there is no prospect of putting a stop to their enormities while the Whites are restricted from pursuing them across the Tenessee.  ID375,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,07,21,inform,United States June 4 1794. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives Lay before Congress the copy of a letter with its enclosure from the Secretary of State to the Minister Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty; it being an answer to a letter from the Mnister to him; bearing date the 22 ult. and already communicated. GEO. WASHINGTON. Philadelphia June 2 1794. SIR. If the letter with which you honoured me on the 22d ult. had not entered into a train of recrimination against the United States I should not now trouble you with a return to its unpleasant topics. Among the reasons which would have induced me to add nothing to my letter the 1st of lat month its would have been of some weight that by silence I should avoid the repetition of a style and manner which seem to have produced a personal excitement. As you are willing to admit the authenticity of Lord Dorcester's speech we will with your approbation reserve for a future discussion on what occasion and to what degree an explanation may be required by the government of the United States from a foreign minister. I selected only one passage of that speech because in it was concentrated the real object of the whole; which was to declare an expectation that Great Britain would be at War with the united States in the course of the present year. and if she were to cause the warriors to draw a line. this is the undisguised sense of the governor-general unaffected by the preliminary words which you have thought proper to quote. It is your own interpretation. For so far are you from contradicting my assertion that Lord Dorchester fostered and encouraged in the Indians hostile dispositions towards us that you continue the greater part of your remaining observations to vindicate his persuasion and your own that the principal aggression leading to hostility proceeded from the United States and to suggest many others of the same tendency upon which you would not dilate. I shall not shrink Sir from your charges. 1st Notwithstanding the territory upon which certain inhabitants of Vermont are presented in your letter of the 5th of July 1792 to have trespassed belong to the United States; yet on the 9th of the same month did my predecessor give you as is admitted positive assurances of the determination to discourage and repress the subject of your complaint. The necessary instructions were accordingly forwarded to that state. On examining your correspondence with my department it does not appear that from the 9th of July 1792 to the 10th of March 1794 upwards of nineteen months our government ever unrdestood from yourself or any authority ofhis Britannic Majesty that the original dissatisfaction continued. Nor was any discontent heard from that quarter through other channels except what related to outrages upon our own citizens by British subjects. Then indeed thirty days after the hostile tribes of Indians had been assembled by Lord Dorchester at Quebec you renewyour remonstrance. Although it cannot be by any means believed that this was written in order to ausher in the intelligence which soon after arrived on his speech; ye tit is difficult to account for so long an interval under the circumstances supposed. Nor ought my answer although delayed for fifty days until the 19th of April 1794 to be constured into an assent to any charge since at the end of that period having been disappointed as my letter shews in one opportunity of information and no other presenting itself we were not in a capacity of contradicting your assertions. However Sir the instructions issued in consequence of your application conveyed positive orders for the correction of what upon examination should be found irregular. 2d Among the points to which you intimate that you might have adverted is enumerated the fitting out of two privateers at Charleston South Carolina. Whatever this transaction might have been it probably occurred at the commencement of the war and before the existence of the war was communicated to our government by any of the powers engaged. Had such a transaction been known to the President in time you can well judge from his actual conduct what he would then have done. His proclamation on the 2nd of April 1793 his call upon the state governors on the 26th of the same months to co-operate with him in the work of impartiality and peace; the system of rules which he established and which were imparted to you are unerring indications of the spirit of those measures on which he had determined. He suppressed the consular courts which attempted to pass sentences of condemnation on captures; he restored several vessels to British owners; prosecutions have been instituted against the violaters of neutrality. In a word Sir what has been required under the sanction of the law of nations which had not been fulfilled? How many thingshave been spontaneously done to evince our impartiality? Let me request you to review my predecessor’s letters to you of April 22 May 15 June 5 August 7 8 25 September 5 and 12 1793: and to say if more could be well expected from us? After such demonstrations it might have been hoped that the equipment of these two privateers would not rise again in the shape of a charge. But the letter of the 5th of June being conceived of itself to be satisfactory is here inserted. In the letter which I had the honour of writing you on the 15th of May in answer to your several memorials of the 8th of that month I mentioned that the President reserved for further consideration a part of the one which related to the equioment of two privateers in the port of Charleston. The part alluded to was that wherein you express your confidence that the executive government of the United States would pursue measures for represeeing such practices in the future and for restoring to their rightful owners any captures which such privateers might be bring into the ports of the United States. The Presidentafter a full investigation of this subject and the most mature consideration has charged me to communicate to you that the first part of this application is found to be jest and that effectual measures are taken for preventing repetitions of the act therin complained of; but that the latter part desiring restitution of the prizes is understood to be inconsistent with the rules which govern such cafes and would therefore be unjustifiable towards the other party The principal agents in this transaction were French citizens. Being within the United States at the moment a war broke out between their own and another country they determine to go in its defence; they purchase arm and equip a vessel with their own money man it themselves receive a regular commission from their nation depart out of the United states and then commence hostilities by capturing a vessel If under these circumstancethe commission of the captors was valid the property according to the laws of war was by the capture transferred to them; and it would be an aggression on their nation for the United states to rescue it from them whether on the high seas or on coming into their ports. If the commission was not valid and consequently the property not transferred by the laws of war to the capture then the case would have been cognizable in our courts of admiralty and the owners might have gone thither for redress. So that on neither supposition would the executive be justifiable in interposing. With respect to the United States the transaction can in no wise be imputed to them. It was in the first moment of the warߝin one of the their most distant port.ߝbefore measures could be provided by the government to meet all the cases which such a state of things was to produce impossible to have known and therefore impossible to have been prevented by that government. The moment it was known the most energetic orders were sent to every state and port in the union to prevent a repetition of the accident. On a suggestion that citizens of the United States had taken part in the act one who was designated was instantly committed to prison for prosecution; one or two others have been since named and committed in like manner; and should it appear that there were still others no measures would be spared to bring them to justice. The President had even gone farther; He has required as a reparation of their breach of respect to the United States that the vessels so armed and equipped shall depart from our ports. You will see Sir in these proceedings of the President unequivocal proofs of the line of strict right which he means to pursue. The measures now mentioned are taken in justice to the one part; the ulterior measure of seizing and restoring the prizes is declined in justice to the other; and the evil thus early arrested will be of very limited effects; perhaps indeed soon disappear altogether. As to the permission from the governor of South Carolina ??? ??? departures of ??? privateers ??? ??? you may assure yourself of a proper inquiry; and I take the liberty of requesting any evidence which you may have of it 3. With so many direct proofs in your hands of the opinion constantly maintained by our government against the legality of captures in general made by illegal privateers it is not easily explained why the validity of those before the 5th of June 1793 should be argued from a refusal to restore them. The above received letter of that date neither affirms nor disaffirms their validity; but declines the granting of restitutions being inconsistent with the rules which govern such cases. Those ruled are That if the commission be good the capture is good; if the commission be bad the capture is bad; but whether it be good or bad is not decided; it being enough to prove that the transaction for the reasons assigned can in no wise be imputed to the united States. But if captures of this kind prior to the 5th of June 1792 do really amount (as is conceived by some) to no very considerable value this would of itself lessen the importance of the insinuation. 4th. The secretary of war has undertaken to ascertain the precise state of the privateers le Petit Democrate and la Carmagnole and the result will be communicated to you. In the mean time it is a matter of some surprise that vessels whose single employment and profit must consist in cruizing on the ocean should have remained in the port of New-York during the whole winter and probably up to the date of your letter (May 22d 1794) May it not be presumed that their activity has been checked by the intervention of the government? But sir if they have not been dismantled your letter brings the first notice of the omission. 5th. It is true that the sale of prizes made by French cruizers has not been prohibited in the United States and that our treaty with France has been so interpreted as not to contemplate a freedom to sell. The next resort was to the law of nations; which was scrupulously searched by the executive with the pure desire of discovering truth and justice to all. Upon this as on many other occasions the civilians differ; Vattel declaring That a privateer may carry his prize into a neutral port and there freely sell it; Martens affirming the same doctrine if it has not been otherwise regulated by treaty; and others opposing it. in this sxhism among the writersit was resolved by the President of the United States to impose no restraint upon those sales; and to refer them; as affairs of legislation to congress at the earliest moment of their session. Thus much has been observed not as my final anser but merely to introduce an assurance that I will follow you in the main discussion whensoever you shall bring it forward in detail. 6th. Undoubtedly sir you have been misinformed that the vessels of France have been permitted to depart from our ports notwithstanding the embargo. As the history of the executive proceedings is neither long nor entangled it shall be frankly stated to you. As soon as the embargo was laid expresses and advice boats were dispatched to notify the officer of the customs and revenue cutters and all others concerned in its execution. The resolution imposing it involved all foreign nations; the instructions from the United States favoured no nation directly or indirectly. A French snow La Camille which had descended the river Delaware as low as New-Castle on her voyage was stopped by an officer of the United States; and the President adhering to perfect impartiality could not think himself justified to gratify the Minister of the French Republic with a passport. Passports being kept under the special view of the President were issued only after his examinatino of each case and the total number of them does not exceed twenty-six. Among them was one to yourself; one to an agent who was sent to the West-Indies upon a business connected with the late captures and condemnation in various British courts of admiralty; one to a citizen whose vessel was under trial in Bermuda and who was anxious to forward the British instructions of the 8th January 1794 with a hope of rescuing her from confiscation; one to the friends of Joshua Barney then in Jamica; twenty for the accomodation of several unfortunate inhabitants of St. Domingo to some of whome our government was advancing money for their support and who could no longer endure their separation from home; one to some other persons in peculiar circumstances desirous of returning to the West-Indies; and in the last instance one to the Minister of the French Republic. If therefore by any other passport or permission; the embargo has been relaxed it was unauthorized by the President and unlawful. The distance of Hampton Road from this city being more than three hundred miles the officers of government resident here could not learn at the moment what was passing there. No intelligence of an official nature of any real importance. No complaint from any other foreign minister or any othe rpseron has since reached us. If Sir you should happen to possess the information I ask it as a favour of you to designate who granted the permission and under what circumstances the French vessels left that road? An investigation however has been and shall be pursued on our part without delay. If the law has been violated it shall be vindicated; but a violation of law is very remote from a permission of the government. 7th. The uniformly unfriendly treatment which the British officers are said to have experienced in the United States cannot be answered until it shall be more explicitly defined. Did this treatment break forth in words or actions not cognizable by law? If so no complaint can be offered to government. Or in words or action which were so cognizable? Our courts are free to foreigners against citizens and independent of influence. To yourself let me appeal that on the representations which you thought proper to lay before the President in relation to the British consul at Baltimore the British consul at Norfolk and the commander of the DȰdalus frigate the necessary measures were promptly adopted; the result has been transmitted to you and no objection has been returned. Nor was the government backward in its interference in the late affair of Philadelphia. And these eing the only occurrences of the kind within my knowledge i trust that no example can be produced of government refusing to extend its protection on every seasonable occasion. 8th. The events at Newport in Rhode-Island are accurately detailed in the proceedings which I have the honour of enclosing to you. Within the limits of the present letter I cannot do more; as it might be an useless talk to detain you with remarks when non of them might be adapted to the animadversions which you mediate. It is enough therefore for me to engage that these animadversions whenever they shall appear shall receive particular attention. Although Sir your charges against the United States are sketched only; the impression which may have been intended cannot be counteracted too soon by such general elucidations as at a future day may be more minutely unfolded. But let these facts be as they will; are they indicative of a hostile disposition in the United States and ought they ultimately to produce a state of war? This is not the place for us to retort our complaints. But compare them with the whole of your catalogue; and say what may our feeling be? Yet we prefer peace. 9th. As Lord Dorchester's endeavour to stir up the Indians against us is without justification; so is the expedition of Governor Simcoe without pretext. That you have received no intelligence of such an event having actually occurred leaves room to conjecture that you may not be without intelligence of it having been designed; and that it has therefore probably taken place. But you insist that much will depend on the place intended for the fort. Let the point allotted for it on the Miami be unknown; the place is for our immediate purpose adequatley market out by eing on the river. A single glance of the eye over the map proves that its source is within the limits of the United States. In its whole length it is flanked on each side by our territory. Its very mouth is to the Southward of our line as recognised by our treaty with his Britannic Majesty. On no part therefore of the rapids can a fort be built but within out country. This being fixed your argument is that if the fort be for the purpose of protecting subjects of his majesty residing in districts dependent on the fort of Detroit or of preventing that fortress from being straitened by the approach of the American army; the principle of statu quo until the final arrangement of the point in discussion between the two countries shall be concluded will strictly apply. To change by hostile movements the condition of a thing concerning which a treaty is opened not being consonant with the spirit of adjustment the principle of statu quo has been generally adopted. The nearest point of the rapids to Detroit cannot be less than fifty miles. They have never been considered they never could be considered as appending to Detroit. But you proceed and say tha tthe proposed assumption of territory may depend on districts which depend on Detroit. It is too obvious to dwell upon the remark that if Detroit which lies within the United States becomes the first station from which a district may be generated one encroachment may beget another ad infinitum. It will however be very acceptable to understand with accuracy how much of our territory towards the Miami was actually possessed by the military establishment of Detroit at the time of peace. I mention the military establishment; because if any subjects of his Britainnic majesty reside beyond the line of actual possess they are as being within our limits under our jurisdiction. To prevent the fortress of Detroit from being straitened by the approach of the American army is either a new modification of the preceding idea or founded upon a untenable suspicion. For the question must recur are the rapids an appendage to Detroit? Were they connected with it at the peace? If convenience only were to be consulted and a wide range of unsettled territory by being suitable to the momentary circumstances of one nation is to be transferred for that reason alone from another which is the true proprietor we might even then controvert the conveniency of the rapids to Detroit. If right be consulted our right is complete. Is then our territory to be thus seized? Nay more sir I am authorized to say to you explicitly that the American army has no instructions to straiten or annoy that post; and that if the descent on the rapids was dictated by this consideration it ought to be discontinued without cause. I have the honour Sir to be with great respect Your most obedient servant EDM. RANDOLPH. Mr. Hammond Minister Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty. True Copy. GEO. TAYLOR jun.  ID377,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,07,18,inform,Philadelphia June 3. [ Authentic.] Copy of a letter from General Wilkins to Col. C. Biddl dated Pittsburgh 23 d May 1794. I this moment received yours of the 17th inst. I arrived about fifteen minutes ago from Le Boeuf and left the detachment there well covered and in good spirits. They have built under my directions two small block-houses picketed in which I think will render them sufficiently strong until the reinforcement goes under Capt. Denny. The Indians I have conversed with still continue of the opinion that the British will make an opposition to the establishment at Presque Isle. There arrived at Cuslawago while I was there an Indian from Sandusky where he had been left by the Senecas last fall sick;ߝhe says the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada M'Kee and Elliot the Indian agent (the two last refugees from this country) were visiting all the Indian towns in that quarter and exciting them to continue their opposition to the Americans and assuring them of support from their father the British monarch. He further adds that they were ready for fighting Gen. Wayne the moment he moved; and that the British were erecting garrisons at the Miami river. Heconfirms the accounts of the other Indians that they were determined to oppose the establishment at Presque Isle. There were in the Port of Philadelphia on the 25th of May. 62 Ships 73 Brigs 7 Snows 60 Schooners 42 Sloops. 244 In the House of Representatives of the United States Thursday June 5 1794. The House according to the order of the day resolved itself into a committee of the whole House on the report of the Committee to whom was referred the remonstrance of the People west of the Alleghany Mountains relative to the navigation of the river Mississippi and after some time spent therein Mr. Speaker resumed the chair and Mr. Trumbull reported that the Committee according to order had the same report under consideration and come to a resolution thereupon which he delivered in at the Clerk's table where the same was twice read and agreed to by the House as follows: Resolved That as it appear from the communications of the Executive that the right of the United States to the free navigation of the Mississippi is now the subject of negotiation with the Court of Spain; and as it is the interest of the United States and every part thereof to come to an amicable adjustment of the right in that mode rather than resort to any means constitutionally belonging to the Legislature no farther proceeding should be had on the said remonstrance during the present session of Congress. Extract from the Journal.  ID378,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,11,17,inform,American papers are received dated October 4. 1794. They contain two letters from General Wayne to the American Secretary at War giving an account of a severe action he had with the Indi ans who were assisted by the volunteers and militia of Detroit on the 20th August on the banks of the Miamis in the vicinity of the British post and garrison at the foot of the Rapids.–The action was bloody and he says our army was left in full and quiet possession of the field of battle which terminated under the influence of the guns of the British garrison as you will observe by the inclosed correspondence which passed between Major Camp bell Commandant and myself upon the occasion. He adds℃We remained three days and nights on the banks of the Miamis in front of the field of battle; during which time all the houses and corn fields were consumed and destroyed for a con siderable distance both above and below Fork Mia mis as well as within pistol shot of that garrison who were compelled to remain tacit spectators to this general devastation and conflagration among which were the stores and houses of Colonel Mac kee the British Indian agent and principal stimu lator of the war now exiting between the United States and the Savages. The American paper from which this account is taken does not give the correspondence above alluded to but concludes the article thus: Besides the very important papers which we have been able to offer to our readers this day the Executive we understand has received copies of a correspondence between the British Major Camp bell and General Wayne. The Major begins it by inquiring of the General by what authority he came there. The General answers by requiring to know who gave Campbell authority to establish a fort at that place it being within our side of the treaty boundary and no such establishment there when that instrument was signed. We hope ere long our gallant General will give a good account of this Mr. Campbell.  ID395,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,09,21,inform,A short Description of and Remarks upon a new State called The Western Territory being one of four settled by the Americans since 1774. THAT no nation can serve the Americans with good equal in quality and price to Britain is what the whole world knows and from experience the most obstinate rebel American dare not deny: It is with pleasure therefore we inform our readers that the United States are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures–They have already laid out four new States since the beginning of their rebellion viz. Vermont Kentucky Indiana and The Western Territory. About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky ten years ago lay in forest wild it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has been the population that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants already in each of these States. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year 1789 and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States published in American in May last we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them called The Western Territory; and it must rerejoiced the heart of every Briton to read it and think that the settling of these countries though the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 20 years will long keep them from manufacturing and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman even though wages are very high when he can for twenty pounds purchase a thousand acres of land that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect that new channels of commerce will be opened and the inland parts of the Continent will require an incresing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation will be diffused through a country more fertile more susceptible of population and six time more extensive than all the Thirteen United States. The Western Territory Is the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi riverlb/>–north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania– south and south-east by the Ohio reiver; contains according to Mr. Hutchins Geographer General to the Congress 411000 square miles equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres from which he deducts forty-three millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hunred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the foederal government which is to be sold for the discharthe debt owing to the United States. But a very small proportion of theselands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*. On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements and already commenced*#x2013;one at Marietta the other at Miami. This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787 and already contains about 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi Ohio Muskingham Hockhocking Sioto Miami Wobash &c.–Coal and iron mines and salt pits abound in this State; the soil is excellent–as rich as can be imagined and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour. It is exceeding healthy pleasant and commodious–the most fertile sport of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States. The timber is tall and in great variety.–Streams for mills abound here. Wheat indigo hemp and cotton thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties and justify the descrpition of travellers who call it the *garden of of a great empire will be fixed in some future pethe world*. It is here probably also that the centre riod. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accomodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with wild game of every kind; herds of deers elks bear &c. fill the extensive meadows of this country–turkies geese swans and partridges &c. are innumerable. The rivers are excellently stored with fish and almost all navigable for small sloops. In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30000 persons' and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States. Rejoice O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you and you *only* *No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum.  ID400,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,15,inform,The Cherokee Chiefs are not to be presented at Court.
