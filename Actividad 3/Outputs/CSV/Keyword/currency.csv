No less than 300 ton of them were contracted for by Congress in the year 1787 to be coined at the rate of 50 ton per annum ; the contracters were also bound down to make them all of the famous Jersey copper. They are a little larger than the British halfpence. No British copper no passes in the United States;–silver and gold coins of all nations however pass cur rent. The congress have not yet ordered a silver coinage.  ID33,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,11,inform,Extract of a letter from a gentleman in America to his friend in Greenock . No doubt Sir you have been expecting this some time a remittance in money for your goods; but as part of them is still on hand I could not properly answer you in cash or bills ; however if you will accept of wheat in return it shall be immediately sent you ; for our wheat crop has been so plentiful that we can supply you with many thousand bolls of an eceeding fine quality ; and to my knowledge there are several ships loading for your market at present.  ID92,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,14,inform,As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at the opening of the Congress of the United States at New York Nov. 6 1792 gives an impartial account of the situation of tha country we are persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives IT is some abatement of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our western frontier have terminated: You will I am persuaded learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the further effusion of blood–to arrest the progress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable purposes:–In making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the event or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable; to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case. A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thus far will I trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them indeed is still depending; but a favorable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by anything that has yet happened. In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will I presume be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased. It must add to your concern to be informed that besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it. A part of the Cherokees known by the name of Chickamagas inhabiting five villages on the Tennessee River have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements. It was hoped that the treaty of Holston made with the Cherokee Nation in July 1791 would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter. The information which has been received on this subject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive precautions only have been enjoined and observed. It is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever on the part of the United States or their citizens is even alleged as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter. I have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete and pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable. In looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year. This however will be better ascertained in the course of the session; and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostilities. I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory–To enable by competent rewards the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable. The prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated–This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United States. These impediments have lessened and are lessened in local extent; and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the law appears to be progressive. But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters I judged a special interposition on my part proper and advisable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto. Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders. And Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend upon me shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws. In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of the Government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens. I can not forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the structure of the system which in some cases tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this subject provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the courts of the United States and a supplementary definition of offenses against the constitution and laws of the union and of the punishment for such offenses will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention. Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary. It would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your consideration of the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations and other infractions of the law of nations which furnishes just subject of complaint might endanger our peace with them. And in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose which takes place if not renewed at the close of the present session. In execution of the authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our mint; others have been employed at home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them. The regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage as being essential to their due operation and to order in our money concerns will I doubt not be resumed and completed. It is represented that some provisions in the law which establishes the Post-Office operate in experiment against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should this upon due enquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and infor mation will I doubt not lead to the application of a remedy. The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky has been notified to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order. It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for three millions of florins–one at Antwerp at the annual interest of four and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all charges.–The rates of these loans and the circumstances under which they have been made are confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad. Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives. I entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effec tual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the government –no measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation. Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made of the Bank of the United States pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made. Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and I doubt not will engage your early attention. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. I content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you. Various temporary laws will expire during the present session. Among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will merit particular notice. The results of your common deliberations hitherto will I trust be productive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents; such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment upon which under Divine Providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness. Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivation of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils.  ID119,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1816,11,21,inform,Canada Papers. Montreal Oct. 5. On the afternoon of Saturday last the specie seized on board the Lake Champlain steam-boat amounting to upward of 12000 dollars arrived at his Majesty's cash-office here under the escort of the 19th light dragoons from St John's. At length we have authentic accounts relating to the expedition of Lord Selkirk ; they are very important as many ex parte details have been published - his taking Fort William by storm making all the partners of the North West Company prisoners &c. ; but the cause of the expe dition has never been explained. The Canadian Courant puts it in a very clear point of view:– Mr Robert Semple the Governor-General The Hudson's Bay Company on the Red River towards the close of the year 1815 took possession of two establishments belonging to the North West Company which had obtruded themselves on the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company. The North West traders then altered their route going into the Upper Country by circuitous ways by which much delay took place ; and in order to try Mr Semple they sent two cartloads of provisions by the former track in June last with a guard of fifty men ; the advance twenty-two of the number fell in with one of the natives whom they took forward with them to prevent discovery. The rear-guard passed within four miles of the settlement ; they were perceived by the Governor and were attacked by a party from the garrison consisting of about thirty soldiers ; an engagement took place stated on the 19th of June. Mr Semple and 21 of his men were killed ; the rest of his forces returned defeated to the fort ; it is on this account that the expedition of Lord Selkirk was undertaken. The manner of Lord Selkirk's conducting the expedition we do not justify nor indeed can we form any opinion on the subject without further authentic details ; it is however but justice to say that the Hudson's Bay Company have rights and are a chartered Company ; the North West Traders though we believe a most respectable body are only an Association of Merchants.  ID123,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,19,inform,Extract of a letter from the agent to at the Cape of Good Hope dated 15th Nov. 1817: – The following most daring instance of piracy was committed in our harbour on the 11th inst. viz.– The Elizabeth White lying at anchor off Robin Island with about 120 tons of oil on board was boarded at about one a. m. by a party of armed deserters from his Majesty's 10th regiment and convicts about 12 in number i. e. five soldiers and seven convicts who after securing the hatches &c. obtained possession of the ship and in the same instant cut the cables loosed the sails and favoured by a strong S. E. wind succeeded in carrying her off at six a.m. The captain and crew having refused to listen to their invitation to join them in their piratical undertaking with the exception of the mate were permitted to leave the ship in the boat which reached Robin Island in safety about four o'clock the same day. By a letter received to-day we learn that the Admiral Gambier Brash laden with Government stores for Ceylon was totally lost on the morning of the 20th of June last having struck on the reef Roan de Nova in the Mozambique Channel ; crew saved. A letter from Halifax dated the 27th Nonember says – Colonel Bouchette Surveyor - General of Lower Canada with Captain Campbell of the 60th regiment and Mr Bouchette jun. arrived here on the 19th inst. The only information I can yet give you is that the exploring survey has been extended from the source of the St Croix river to the river Restigouche in line about 100 miles ; in this short distance both parties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the severest nature. The Americans employed on the same line with our English Commissioners are represented as men of great ability and acting with that spirit of liberality that infuses confidence on each side rendering their arduous task less severe and gloomy than was to have been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this quarter. Our trade continues dull and money scarce. Government bills are 3 per cent advance but expected to be lower in consequence of the Commissary-General having refused to take the provincial notes. Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard –On Friday night about half-past nine o'clock this place was thrown into the greatest consternation by the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard the beating of drums and the firing of the men of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire having broken out in the house belonging to the steam engine erected for carrying on the new works situated in the southern part of the dock - yard near the kilns used for burning cement stone. The most serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and what was more distressing to the feelings of the spectators was its coniguity to the workhouse which from the pressure of the times and want of employment is crowded with many unfortunate individuals. Providence however averted the impending danger and about twelve o'clock we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames subdued with only the loss of the engine-house. No lives it is understood have been lost but one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker of the Northumberland and the officers of that ship Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter and Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary with the military officers and soldiers of the garrison assembled on the first alarm. The latter were under arms the whole time and were of great service in keeping off the spectators. The inhabitants of the twon were at one time under serious apprehensions as the fire was not far from the Fountain tavern and the residence of Mr Miller in High Street. At the former the landlady of the house had but recently lain in and was removed on the first alarm being given. Sir Robert Barlow from Chatham who superintends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle was here yesterday to investiage into the cause which it is suspected arose from carlessness – The damage however has not been so great as was at first expected and which it might have been but for the prompt and effectual assistance that was given – Sheerness January 11  ID139,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,01,inform,Leeds April 19.–We have been somewhat alarmed here to-day though no bad consequences have followed by a most numerous assemblage of croppers cloth-dressers and other artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep com ing in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley Armley Holbeck and all the neighbouring towns and villages and it is computed that at one time there were full three thousand of these distressed people assembled chiefly in Briggate. As many of them marched into the town with great sticks in their hands they created some little alarm but their conduct was uniformly peaceable; their complaints were not loud though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and Magistrates with the whole of the Civil Power were in rea diness to act as circumstances might require; but fortunately there was not the slightest occasion for their interference. By far the greater number of the assemblage dispersed by noon and returned to their respective homes. Several respectable gentlemen went among them to ascertain the motives of their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it does not appear that they have the least disposition to commit any breath of the peace ; but in fact the people know not what to do in their present state of distress. I understand that an active subscription is going to enable a number of these poor men to proceed to Canada; and others are said to have expressed their wish to be sent to Botany Bay provided they can obtain the sanction of Government. The case of these people is a very perplexing one ; for their numbers augment daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories. Chester April 19.–John Bagguely John Drummond and Samuel Johnson convicted of sedition on the 15th inst. were this day after an adrdress from the Chief-Justice (Mr Serjeant Copley) sentenced to two years' imprisonment and to find security for their good behaviour for two years each in L.500 himself with sureties in L.100 each. We are sorry to hear that great number of the agricultural poor are out of employ in Monmouthshire and that the amount of wages diminishes as works get scarcer. Emigration to America still continues; but it is for the most part of a description of person who have afforded employ to others rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some property with them. Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States there are twenty six persons belonging to one family (Quakers of the name of Thistlewaith) lately residing in Meadow lane Leeds. These industrious and enterprising individuals are gone with an intention of carrying on the woollen manufacture (in conjunction with others) on an extensive scale either at Philadelphia or some other more eligible site in its vicinity. Several other families are preparing to emigrate from the same neighbourhood as well as from Dewsbury Bradford and other places in the vicinity. It is true these extensive emigrations may in some degree contribute to relieve our overburdened population ; but they must likewise tend in an equal ratio to impoverish the nation ; as every individual and family who emigrate setting aside the pecuniary wealth they carry with them take what is of far more consequence to a commercial nation–their talents and industry–articles at present of comparative small value in the country. The very heavy impost which is at present levied upon authors and publishers by being compelled under the existing Copyright Act to deliver eleven copies of every book published to certain public libraries is likely to be repealed by a Bill to be brought into Parliament in a few days. The body of evidence taken before the Select Committe of the House of Commons last year forms a most interesting display of the state of literary property in this country. Saturday last Mr Stuart and Mr Allsop were returned for the Borough of Camelford. Yesterday the Grand Jury for the County of Middlesex found two Bills of Indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury against five of the principal witnesses produced in behalf of the petitioner who were examined before the Select Committee appointed to try the merits of the election fo Penrhyn. Extraordinary Legacy. –A very singular cause is now depending before the Court of Session in Scotland respecting a legacy to the amount of upwards of fifty thousand pounds bequeathed by the late Earl of F. (who died at Berlin) to a foreigner who was one of his domestic servants. The payment of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the late Earl on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consideration ; and from its novelty the case is of course the subject of much conversation in the Northern Metropolis. The arguments and pleadings in this extraordinary suit in which the most eminent counsel of the Edinburgh Bar are engaged display much classical as well as legal learning ; but no judgement has yet been pronounced by the Court. From the magnitude of the sum in dispute it will probably be finally determined by an appeal to the House of Lords.– Morn. Chron. Town Hall Southwark. –Thomas Wing was brought up by Reeve the Marshalman and examined before Sir John Earner[?] the sitting Magistrate charged on suspicion of robbing his employers Messrs Sentance and Flint grocers NO. 300. Borough High-street. The prisoner's detection was caused in the following singular manner :–He was porter to the prosecutors and was frequently about the shop ; a large house dog having seen him take money from the till which he tied in his pocket handkerchief followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a shed near the stables and then he came into the shop and appeared quite restless pulling every person by the skirt[?] and apparently wishing them to follow him. At length Henry Heydon the apprentice having occasion to go to the stable the dog followed him and having drawn his attention to the heap of rubbish under which the money was buried began to scratch at it till he brought the booty to view ! The apprentice brought it to his master who counted and found it to contain 12s. in copper coin. After marking it he desired the boy to place it in the same spot which he did and soon afterwards finding that it was removed he asked the prisoner some questions about it but he declared his ignorance of the whole transaction. Reeve the Marshalman was then sent for who on searching the prisoner found some of the marked ballpence[?] in his pocket.–Remanded. Bank Committee. –The Opposition Journals last wek asserted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House of Commons intend to report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of paying in specie. That is the Bank shall pay next January in gold bars at the present price of gold L.4 1s. per ounce any quanitity of notes not being less than sixty or a hundred pounds' worth and that in two years afterwards they shall pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold L.3 17s. 10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's plan goes farther. It recommends that the Bank shall never pay in coin but in bars of gold at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall at all times buy gold when offered at L.3 17s. and sell it when demanded at L.3 17s. 10 1/2d. If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the Restriction Committee intend to report in favour of payments in bullion at the market price ; and should Parliament adopt that plan ; then there will be a very great saving to the nation in the expense of coinage the waste of &c. All the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in foreign commerce will be answered as well by payments in gold bars as by payments in coins and the danger of a domestic run on the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic as in 1797 will be completely prevented. This is indeed at all times the only danger to which it is exposed. A run for coin on the Country Banks would instantly fall on the Bank of England and would cramp if not dry upthe currency throughout the empire producing the greatest confusion. Now if the Opposition Journals be correct the currency will be placed in perfect security at perfect ease. Nothing will be able to disorder it. If persons will hoard specie they must purchase gold bars or foreign coin or content themselves with silver. In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the amount of L.800000 each year and then the value of gold was rather below the standard price. In the year 1817 we imported to the amount of six millions and in the year 1818 we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. During the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have an abundant harvest or two and little importation of corn become necessary gold will again fall very low. The Bank will then be able to pay to buy gold to the full extent of Mr Ricardo's plan and to place their notes on a firm unquestionable foundation. The finances of the continent and of the world indeed–the sources and circulation of money will during peace gradually become steadier and better known. The East Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quantity of specie while Spanish America in consequence of her troubles yields far less than usual. It would be madness to fly in the face of all these circumstances by compelling the Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may be desirable to limit the issue of bank notes to some certain yet liberal amount. We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the Committee ; but if some rumours be true we augur favourably of it. It[?] is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee and stood alone in voting against the Report. Thus then the Report cannot be in favour of a very sudden or decided plan for the resumpion of cash payments or Mr Tierney would not have voted against it ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable prospect of a rational scheme for that resumption or the other five or six Opposition Members of the Committee would not have voted for it. – Courier. Grand Pigeon Match three Gentlemen of the Midgham Club against thrice of All England took place on Monday on Farnham Downs at twenty-one birds twenty-one yards distance from the gun for 150 guineas aside charge unlimited. Messrs Adams Russel and Holt were selected from the Crack Club against Messrs King Short and Keans. The sports were as follows ; Mr Adams killed nineteen birds and the remaining two were severely hit. Russel killed eighteen but lost one three yards out of bounds and Mr Holt bagged sixteen making a grand total of fifty-two from sixty-three. The Club was at first backed to win but the England shots were now backed freely at six to four as they were considered safe eighteen bird men. Mr King killed twenty but lost two out of bounds. Short missed his first three which brought betting to two to one onn the Club but he killed the next seventeen and missed the last bird. Mr Keans had seventeen to tie and eighteen to win and he was back at five to four and at two to one after killing eleven birds in succession. He however missed the seventeenth and had to kill the other four to win. He succeeded and the prize was won by once bird. It was altogether the most interesting match of this sort known for years. Letters from Petersburgh of the 15th ultimo mention that Prince Gustavus of Sweden son of King Gustavus IV. has obtained permission from the Emperor his uncle to proceed to England for the purpose of completing his studies at Oxford. Reports speak highly of the virtues and talents of this unfortunate young Prince who excites universal interest and sympathy in the north of Europe. In these feelings we must largely share for we cannot easily forget the associations with which the name of Vasa was connected not the services rendered by two Sovereigns of that Illustrious House to the cause of civil and religious liberty. It is said that a great Potentate whose generosity and magnanimity are proverbial has settled upon Prince Gustavus an allowance of L. 2000 Sterling per annum during the residence of the latter in England and that on the return of his Royal Highness to the Continent he is to espouse his cousin a Princess of Hesse Cassel who if rumour be correct has lately refused a matrimonial alliance with the new Swedish dynasty. Papers arrivedon Saturday from New York and Boston to the 15th ult. The National Intelligencer in an article occupying five columns under the head of Strictures on Mr Lacock's Report on the Seminole War defends the sanguinary proceedings of General Jackson. This production is said to have excited a great sensation throughout the United States being supposed to express the sentiments of the Executive. The General had left Washington for his residence in Tenessee. By an arrival from Aux Cayes intelligence was stated to be received that Sir G M'Gregor's troops had deserted him owing to the want of funds for their subsistence.  ID97,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,09,12,entertain,The laws of the State of Pennsylvania and that of Massachusetts by which the punishment of death is abolished in all cases except for wilful murder are about to be adopted by the respective Legislatures of all the other States. The system of the great and merciful???caria has taken place of the sanguinary Penal laws of England. The abolition of Negro slavery which has taken shape in the five New England States of New Hampshire Massachusets Rhode island Connecticut and Vermont; in the Midland States of New York New Jersey Pennsylvania and Delawar; and in the Western State of Kentucky for several years past is now extended by act of Congress to the Southern States of Virginia North Carolina South Carolina Georgia and Maryland; and the emancipation of the remainder of that unfortunate race of men is to take place on or before the fifth of November 1795. The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts has g???ed a part of the public lands to the emancipated Negroes of that State in proportion to the numbers of the respective families where the liberal and philanthropic mind is gratified by seeing them erect villages cultivate farms and form communities of civilized Societies. Before the Gentleman who has favoured us with this Intelligence left America they had established a Lodge of Masonry; and he had the satisfaction of seeing them on a grand day parade to Church in all the magnificence of the Order where a sermon was preached on the occasion by one of their own colour. They have also endowed public schools employed??? and erected places of Public Worship. The Officers Non-commissioned Officers and Soldiers who served in the Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country have at last received a reward infinitely beyond their expectations but every way corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic. Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress this last Session to each individual who served throughout the war; and to the defendants of those who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature and eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran as has been the case of former grants he is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money at the present market price from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land and the rest in moneya s may be most agreeable to the receiver. The Mint of the United States which was established two years since has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles half eagles and quarter eagles. The first is exactly five and forty shillings English money or ten American coin. The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half and quater which makes the courie of exchange simple and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive that ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle. There is besides one more silver coin which is called a Dime and is the tenth part of a dollar. The copper coin is called a Cent and is the tenth part of a Dime. Six of the ships of war which were voted by Congress in November last are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next and will complete a fleet of??? hundred guns. The city of Washington which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground near the banks of the Potamac possessing a delightful water prospect together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city. From the President's house to the Capitol run two great pleasure parks or malls which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol as well as those of the President's house are of the finest marble. The building of these superb edifices has been much retarded by the want of stone cutters masons bricklayers carpenters and blacksmiths who at this time actually receive the enormous wages of ten shillings American currency per day. The district of Country at the back of North Carolina reaching to the Mississippi and covering a country six hundred miles long by three hundred broad is next winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the Province of Maine extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the river St. Croix is expected to form a Seventeenth. The new cities build in America since her independence are Grenville in the State of Georgia; Martenberg the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and Nashville in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville Fairfield and Lex ington in the State of Kentucky; Washington the Capital of the United States; Sunbury in the State of Pennsylvania; Hudson upon Husdon's River and Cooper's Town in the State of New York; Bennington in the State of Vermont; and Paterson in the State of New Jersey. All the towns burnt by the English in the was have been rebuilt and the old cities of Charlestown Baltimore Philadelphia New York and Boston have been extended to more than double the extent they had before the peace. The population of the United States by the last Census in 1790 was more than double what it was in 1775 by which it appears that America doubles her number of people every fifteen years. The emigrations from the different nations in Europe to that country are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually. The increase of farms and villages has been so great as to people four new States and to extend their Settlements from the Atlantic to the Ohio in the South and from the Atlantic to the Lakes on the River St. Lawrence in the North.  ID369,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,11,inform,As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at the opening of the Congress of the United States at New York Nov. 6 gives an impartial account of the situation of that counttry we are persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives IT is some aba???of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally I am not able to add to it information that Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our western frontier have terminated. You will I am persuaded learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of preserving hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the further effusion of blood–to arrest the progress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable puposes:–In making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the events or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable; to ascertain unequivocally the such is the case. A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thu s far will I trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them indeed is still depending; but a favourable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by any thing that has yet happened. In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will I presume be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased. It must add to your concern to be informed what besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it. A part of the Cherokees known by the name of Chickamagas inhabiting five villages on the ??? river have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements. It was hoped that the treat of Holston made with the Cherokee nation in July 1791 would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unproved hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter. I have reason to believe that every predictable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete. And pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termintion of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable. In looking forward to the future expence of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year. This however will be better ascertained in the course of the session; and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds from the supposition of no material extention of the spirit of hostilities. I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all ??? plans must prove nugatory. To enable by ???ent rewards the employment of qualified ??? persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoing civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulation calction its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable. The prosperous state of our revenue had been intimated–This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in someplaces continue to embarrass the collection of??? duties on spirits distilled within the United States. These impediments have lessened and are?ess???d in local extent; and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the lawapp??? to be progressive. But symptoms of increased opposition have lately manifested themselves in certain quarters; I judged special interposition on my part proper and adviseable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for this object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in excution for bring to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto. Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders. And Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend on me shall be wanting???sert and maintain the just authority of the law. In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full co-operation of the other departments of the government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens. I cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are being experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the structure of that system which some cases??? to relax their efficacy. As connected with the subject provisions to facilitate the raking of??? upon processes out of the Courts of the United States and supplementary definition of offence against the constitution and laws of the union??? of the punishment for such offences will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention. Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary; I would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition??? give that satisfaction to foreign nations which??? may sometimes have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your considerations the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations as other infractions of the law of nations which furnishes just subject of complaint might endanger our own peace with them. And in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention??? expiration of the law for that purpose which taken place if not re??? at the close of the present session. In execution of the authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engagement of our mint–others have been employed at at home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings and therefore now putting into proper condition for the purpose of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half-dollars; the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them. The regulation of some provision in the law which establishes the Post Office open to in experiment against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should that upon the enquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and infor mation will I doubt not lead to the application of a remedy. The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky has been notified to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order. It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for three millions of florins—one at Antwerp at the annual interest of four and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all charages.–The rates of these loans and the circumstance under which they have been made ar confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad. Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effecttual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the government –no measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation. Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made for the Bank of the United States pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made. Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and I doubt not engage your early attention. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives I content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you. Various temporary laws will expire during the present sesssion. Among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will merit your particular notice. The results of your common deliberations hitherto will I trust be productive of solide and durable advantages to our constituentes; such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strength and confirm their attachment upon which under Divine Providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness. Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivatino of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils. G. WASHINGTON.
