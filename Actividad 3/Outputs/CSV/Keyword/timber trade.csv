This will prove a temporary misfortune to the woodcutters by depriving them of the principal means of subsisting their negroes and might be productive of mischief were it not that the British Superintendant Colonel Despar with the assistance of the Calypso sloop of war keeps the woodcutters in order. This may rise the price of mahogany at home and certainly will raise provisions here.  ID126,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,28,inform,Canada Extract of a letter from a Mercantile House in Nova Scotia to their Correspondents in this quarter. We sincerely hope that the Duties Government had in contemplation (last year) to impose upon Timber imported into Great Britain and Ireland from the British North American Provinces equal to the additional duty imposed on Foreign Timber in 1813 will be further suspended. Our[?] commercial system chiefly depends upon the encouragement of the Timber branch ; ships that carry away that article[?] bring us [?] at a low freight whereby we are enabled to furnish the British West India Islands with an abundant supply of Fish[?] and that on very moderate terms ; but in the event of Government persisting in imposing the Duty on Timber from hence that branch of our trade will inevitably revert to the Americans besides being the ruin of many in this and in the neighbouring Provinces. The supposed revenue that would accrue to the mother country upon trial will be found delusive ; to prove this many obvious[?] reasons can be adduced : As the trade now exists all the Timber extracted from these Colonies to Great Britain and Ireland is paid for in British Manufactures ; the export of so bulky an article as Timber and the import of so ponderous an article as [?] employs[?] an immense number of British ships ; objects certainly of more real value to the revenue of Britain than any benefit they could possibly derive from direct Duties imposed on the export of Timber from British North America. It cannot be denied that previous to 1813 when the additional Duty was laid on Foreign Timber they (the Foreigners) were not only the carriers but would not accept an ounce of British Manufacture in payment for their TImber–no nothing but you gold[?] which was so much in demand that 28s. was given for a [?]. Another very cogent reason [?] be advanced in favour of what is commonly denominated the Timber Trade from these Provinces ; it facilitates emigration and introduces many valuable settlers into this Province and the Canadas that would go to the States of America ; and the day is perhaps not so far distant when they would of accessity[?] become our enemies. When Great Britain was first involved in war with the eastern countries from whence the principal supply of Timber was derived the merchants in that line[?] as well as the ship-masters were not only alarmed but convinced themselves ruined ! The Baltic is shut[?] what shall we do for Timber and with our ships? They properly concluded that perhaps the British Provinces could supply them ; they made the experiment they were not disappointed–but succeeded far beyond their expectations. If therefore in time of war Britain has took to her colonies for a supply of such a necessary article as Wood ; it is not reasonable for us to conclude that their interests will not be wholly neglected when blessed with peace. Extract of a Letter dated Savannah 25th Nov. 1817 In the Southern States this autumn has been the most fatal they have experienced since their colonization. Many thousands have been hurried off to that narrow house destined for all that live. A most malignant fever has prevailed to an alarming extent. In this city during the last four months the deaths have been equal to one-eights of the inhabitants left in it ; and in Beaufort (S. Carolina) and in some of the Southern Counties the morality has exceeded one-sixth!  ID144,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,06,02,inform,Colonial Intelligence Advices have been received again from the Cape of Good Hope of 6th March which are several days later than those acquired formerly. Of the rising of the Caffres there remains no doubt although it does not appear that Government have as yet received official information regarding it. The private accounts state that two valuable officers had lost their lives and also a great number of men. The Governor himself in order by his presence the sooner to suppress the Caffres had with a competent force proceeded to the interior. Great inconvenience was experienced for the want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not this been the case it was believed that in a very few days tranquility would have been restored. We are sorry to state that another hurricane has taken place in the Isle of France ; it commenced on the 25th January and has done great mischief to the shipping and also to the plantations of that ill-fated Island. A Dutch mail has arrived with papers to the 19th inst. At Batavia two of the leaders of the late disturbances have been tried and execute and that degree of tranquility which terror produces has been restored. In the administration of their colonies in the east the conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and oppressive ; and it is to be regretted that the extensive and fertile island of Java should have been surrendered to their rapacity. During the short time that it was in possession of this country various important improvements were introduced into its domestic administration ; the practise of torture according to the humane and enlightened maxims of British jurisprudence was abolished ; new and better modes of collecting the revenue were adopted ; and a spirit of mildness and of regard for the interests of all the various classes of which the population is composed was evinced which made the British Government highly popular. Considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants for the safety of the Queen Charlotte Jamaica packet. She sailed from Jamaica the 29th March and had a great quantity of specie on board. No things have since been received of her. Several vessels sailed since her departure and have arrived safe. The Ocean quitted Jamaica on the 6th of April and arrived here several days since. Several passengers landed at Portsmouth on Thursday from Jamaica bring Port Royal Papers to the 25th of March. The 50th Regiment had arrived at Kingston from Cork ; and the 2nd West India Regiment was about to embark for Sierra Leone to be disbanded.  ID244,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1834,09,24,inform,The St Nicholas Morgan which has arrived off Aberdeen from Bathurst New South Wales reports that timber was very scarce ; that the woods between that town and Miramichi were on fire ; that 250 tons of cut timber had been burnt and the people in the woods had been obliged to abandon their camps and fly to save their lives. The thermometer at Bathurst was from 85 to 90.  ID384,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,09,28,inform,The American Congress have laid on port duties which may be deemed moderate in several particulars when compared to those of most of the European kingdoms and cities and in many instances are much less than heretofore imposed by the Provincial Assemblies. This may be hugly prudent in a republic which is courting commerce for her ports and for such a variety of articles the native products of that extensive region to give in return for fabrics not yet manufactuted among themselves. Their tobacco corn iron hemp flax lumber & are inexhaustible sources of wealth and their fisheries very considerable.
