The multitude are out of employ and who cannot get into any situations by which they might support themselves is truly deplorable. If a place falls vacant a croud of necessitous candidates immediately urge their distresses and it is certainly a fact that for one appointment there are thirty Englishmen who would be happy to obtain it so many have gone out lately to India for whom there is no employment.  ID121,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1817,07,21,entertain,Emigration to America. [ Extracted from No.15 of Cobbet's Register published on Saturday 12th instant ]. Cobbett's arrival in America&c. On Wednesday evening the 27th March we embarked on board the Importer D. Ogden master bound to New York where we arrived on the 5th of May with about 40 steerage passengers farmers and tradesmen who were fleeing from ruin and starvation. In all respects that can be named our passage disagreeable and upon one occasion very perilous from lightning which struck the ship twice shivered two of the masts killed a man struck several people slightly between two of whom I was sitting without at all feeling the blow. Some of our fellow-passengers have found great disappointment ; and it is stated in some of the public papers here that many hundreds have during the last year accepted of the offer of our Consul at New York to go and settle in Canada. You know that I have never advised any body to emigrate. I have always said that it is no place for manufacturers ; no place for men to live without work ; no place for a farmer who does not work himself ; no place in short for any one who is not able and willing to work at the ordinary sorts of work ; but for such men there is every where a plentiful happy and easy life. None should come however who have any views of idleness ; and even for the industrious poor I see no reason why they should expend their last shilling and undergo all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage in order to save those who eat the taxes the expence of their share of poor-rates ; a man and his wife and a child or two cannot come under the expence of 35 guineas at least. A single man 20 guineas before he gets into work again ; and as I always said I never would if I were in the place of such a man expend my earnings on a sea voyage and endure all its hardships in order to remove one eye sore out of the way of corruption. Besides there is the climate which is not so good as ours though it is not bad and people often live to an old age. The country is good but it will easily be conceived that new face an entire new scene a separation from every friend work done in a quite different way from it is in England ; it will easily be conceived that all this makes such a dislocation in a man's mind as to make him very unhappy for a while. Then he cannot expect to find work the first day. He must ask first at any rate. Englishmen are sheepish ; and they are sure to find rascals enough here to foster their disgust merely for the sake of serving the cause of corruption at home. In short I advice nobody to emigrate but I will truly describe the country and the people. As to emigrating with a view of settling and farming in the new countries it is neither more nor less than downright madness. It is what our English farmers know nothing at all about ; it is what they are not at all fit for ; and the far greater part of all such spe culations end in disappointment if not in ruin and premature death. I hope that our beloved country will shortly be fit for an honest and industrious man to live in ; but if any farmers come with money in their pockets my advice is not to give way either to enthusiastic admiration or to instant disgust. But to stop a little ; to look about them ; to see not only after good land but a good market for its products. The western romance writers tell us that the land in the Ohio is too good ; but Mr Mellish in his valuable book tells us that beef and pork sell for three halfpence a pound. An excellent country for people who want to do nothing but eat. – Give me Long Island where the land is not too good ; but where beef and pork sell for about eightpence a pound (I speak of English money); where good hay sells for five pounts a ton ; and where there is a ready market for every species of produce. One thing above all ; if an English farmer (I mean by English people of the whole of the United Kingdom) comes here with money in his pocket let him resolve to keep it there for a year and then he will be sure to do well. – All that I see around me here is well calculated to attract the attention and to please the sight of one like myself brought up in the country always greatly delighted with and somewhat skilled in various pleasing and healthful pursuits. The The people are engaged busily in planting their Indian corn. The cherry trees of which there are multitudes planted in long avenues or rows or round the fields have dropped their blossom and begin to show their loads of fruit. The apple and pear orchards in extent from one to twenty acres on each farm are in full and beautiful bloom. The farms are small in extent ; no appearance of want amongst the labourers who receive in the country about two shillings and threepence (our money) a-day with board and lodging and which board consists of plenty of excellent meat and fish of all sorts the best of bread butter cheese and eggs. That you may form some idea as to prices of living I will state a few facts which have already come within my own knowledge. We are at present at an inn thirteen miles from New York. It is on the road to that city. Scarcely an hour in the day passes without a carriage of some sort offering for going thither and to go by the regular stage costs three shillings. Mind I shall always speak in English money when I do not speak of dollars. We lodge and board in this inn have each a bed-room and good bed have a room to sit in ourselves ; we eat by ourselves ; and it really is eating. – We have smoked fish chops butter and eggs for breakfast with bread (the very finest I ever sa) crackers sweet cakes ; and when I say that we have such and such things I do not mean that we get them for show or just enough to smell to ; but in loads. Not an egg but a dish full of eggs. Not a snip of meat or of fish ; but a plateful. Lump sugar for our tea and coffee ; not broke into little bits the size of a hazle nut but in good thumping pieces. For dinner we have the finest of fish bass mackerel lobsters ; of meat lamb veal ham &c. ; asparagus in plenty ; apple pieces (through in the middle of May). The supper is like the breakfast with preserved peaches and other things. And with all this an excellent cyder to drink with the kindest and most obliging treatment on the part of the landlord and landlady and their sons and daughters we pay no more than 22s. 6d. a week each. In England the same food and drink and lodging at an inn would cost us nearly the same sum every day. But there are two things which no money can purchase any where. The first is no grumbling on the part of the landlady except on account of our eating and drinking too little ; and the other is that Mr Wiggins has no fastening but a bit of chip run in over the latch of the door to a house which is full of valuable things of all sorts and about which we leave all our things much more carelessly than we should do in our own house in any part of England. Here then are we able to live at an inn one of the most respectable in the whole country at the rate of fifty pounds a year while the pay of a common farming man is not much short of that sum.  ID122,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,01,inform,Emigration The authenticity of the following details of the miseries endured by some German emigrants proceeding from Amsterdam to America is we are told guaranteed ; otherwise they are almost too shocking to admit to belief : Libson Nov. 4 We have just been witnesses here of an event which has renewed those gloomy reflexions which the friends of humanity have indulged ever since the commencement of the emigration from Germany and Switzerland to America. We have deplored the error which led so great a number of unhappy persons to expartiate themselves in the hope of finding a happier lot upon the shores of the new world. But it is less to the blindness of the victims of this error than to the abominable speculations of cupidity that we are to attribute these numerous emigrations. the misery of the people of Germany and Switzerland occasioned by a superabundance of population and by the bad harvests of late years serves for aliment to the avarice of certain men who seek to establish criminal projects upon bases almost as obnoxious as those of the former slave trade. Such calculations deserve the attention of Governments and it is with this view that we think is our duty to make known the fate of an expedition of this kind fitted out at Amsterdam last August. But we shall first transcribe from the original the article of the charter party relative to the power reserved by the Captain over the persons of the passengers as inlcuding stipulations which are most characteristic of the nature of that odious traffic :– We passengers promise to fulfil faithfully the following conditions:– With respect to the price of the passage above stipulated for so much as we have not yet paid we engage to gain by our labour in America what we owe and we who owe the whole amount of our passage are bound if required and if we are unable to find better conditions to hire ourselves for four or five years in order to pay for our passage ; and we who have only paid for a part of our passage equally promise to let ourselves out to work for the same time for the sum we still owe. We promise besides we passengers men or women fathers or mothers children and families here assembled the children for their parents the parents for their children the brother for his brother and the sister for her sister when we shall find an opportunity to employ ourselves in America to engage ourselves in service and to answer for one for the other one for all the others whether he be of our family or not so that the price of the passage be diminished or augmented as much as shall be necessary until we all and our families have employment and the captain be no loser by us ; knowing very well that we passengers who have children a family brothers and sisters ought all to sumbit to our wives or husbands our children our brothers our sisters being sent separately to whatever place in order to gain in private service profession or labour or in any manner that shall be deemed best the price of our passage ; and in order that we may not in any case refused the engagements proposed to us or contract others without the permission not knowledge of the capain it is agreed for those who have not yet paid for their passage for those who still owe part and for those who cannot find an engagement that they must consent to me the captain carrying them to such place in America as it shall please me and wherever I may find it expedient to proceed or wherever it may suit me to sail. These horrible conditions were signed by 300 passengers. They had contracted with the Captain of a Dutch ship which was to proceed first to Baltimore. She in the worst state when she sailed from Amsterdam and in defiance of the clauses of the contract by which the Captain had engaged to feed them properly during the voyage he had not even embarked the necessary quanitity of provisions ; for after 62 days navigation the leaks had so gained upon the ship that she was in danger of sinking and famine had already made frightful ravages. It was at the end of that time and in this deplo rable condition that she was forced into Belem near Lisbon. Long before her arrival on our coasts the passengers had been reduced to the greatest misery not more by the small quantity than by the bad quality of the provisions. The water was gone and sea-water was their only drink. So much had they been wasted that forty had already died of famine. Among the rest there were a great many sick some of who have died since their arrival in Portugal. The situation of the vessel had at first given great alarm to our Council of Health who apprehensive of contagion were for an instant fearful that it would be necessary to force her out to sea. That would have been a misery so much the more formidable because the ship was not in a state to keep the sea and all must infallibly have perished. Happily this was deemed unnecessary and a quarantine was ordered. The Regency of Lisbon determined that provisions and other succours should be furnished at the expence of the State. All the Consuls were most active and benevolent in affording assistance. Such was the result of the expedition. Many others have no doubt answered as little the expectations of those who seduced by deceitful promises have emigrated to America in search of happiness which they could not find abandoning their country their parents and their friends. In July a Hamburgh ship with 106 Swiss passengers was at Lisbon in nearly the same distress with the Dutch ship. It is said here that there is a company in Holland which has numerous agents to seduce men to emigrate. It heaps them pell mell on board ships and if they reach their destination they are soon con vinced of the fallacy of all their hopes. It would be a desirable thing for papers in countries where these emigrations are excited to insert the article relative to the charter party given above in order that the simple and credulous may see what they have to undergo.  ID125,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,19,inform,Irish Emigrants. New York Nov. 27. Nothing scarcely can be conceived more distressing than the situation of an unfriended stranger arrived here from across the Atlantic without the means of helping himself and without even enough of acquaintance with the men and things about him to enable him to judge what path he should take to secure him the miseries of absolute want. Such however is actually the situation of hundres who annually land on our shores. To provide for those forlorn beings several attempts have been made by associations of humane individuals here but nothing hitherto has appeared to promising as that of which an account here follows: – At a meeting of Irishmen and descendents of Irishmen held at Harmony Hall on Tuesday the 25th instant for the purpose of promoting a Settlement of Irish Emigrants; Andrew Morris Chairman WM. Sampson Secretary ; Upon the motion of Thomas Addis Emmett the circular previously issues on this subject was read by the Secretary : – Circular It is a sentiment long felt and often expressed that something should be undertaken on behald of the emigrants who flock to these shores. Without any fixed destination they remain in the sea port until beocming victims of bad counsel and bad example they lose the pure and honest energies with which they left their native land and suffer worse than shipwreck in their moral qualities. The Government of this great Republic is well aware of the advantage to be derived from so great a mass of laborious industry when usefully directed and employed–and of adding to the nation's strength men whose attachment to the institutions of this country is assured by so many ties. But it is in the order of things that some of the friends particularly the countrymen of these emigrants who have been some time established and known should come forward to attest the necessity and guarantee the solidity of the enterprise. If his has not been done sooner it is because every advance in social improvement must come in its season. it is the ripeness of the occasion and the voice of the times that now speak. It has been remarked that among the lands nows open for sale and settlement there are some tracks particularly in the Illionois territory where the Irish emigrant with the instruments to which his hands are accustomed and in a climate congenial to his habits might procure to himself immediate shelter and subsistence–and in a few years be able to repay with gratitude the benefits conferred on him. We whose names are undersigned have met to consult upon the means of promoting some establishment that might be a rallying point for the distressed and give to the wanderer a habitation and a home. We have thought of no better way than to address by this circular the friends and well wishers of Ireland who co-operation might give most weight to the measure and to submit whether it might not be advisable to join all our efforts and petition Congress early in the ensuing session for a grant of a suitable track upon a credit of 14 or 15 years subject to such conditions and modifications as the Government may see most fitting. to the Government we would offer no deceptive delusive or precarious motive rather chusing to make its wisdom benignity and patriotism the anchor of our hope. We request of our if you approve of our sentiment and of our project to advance and promote it by your best endeavours ; either by forming organized associations or by obtaining individual signatures to a petition to the effect stated. We have not yet been able to digest a plan and have rather chosen to make this humble beginning in hopes that we should soon receive additional light upon the subject from cor respondence we solicit. We shall nevertheless proceed to investigate the subject and challenge the co-operation of good and respectable men and request of you to do the same. You will please address your answers and any future correspondence to Mr James Moffit No. 15. Frankfort Street New York. Thomas Addit Emmet. Denis M'Carthy William Sampson John R. Skiddy James R. Mullaney John Meyher William James M'Neven Cornelius Heeny Matthew Carroll Robert Swanton James Moffit. New York Nov 18 1817 Mr Emmet then stated that he had been requested by the gentlemen who called this meeting to explain the objects for which it was convenued ; that it could not be necessary to expatiate before those he was now addressin on the situation of the peasantry and farmers in Ireland ; it was at present one of unqualified misetry partly occasioned by their local oppressions and partly by the general calamities of Europe ; it compelled them to fly to these shores in such numbers and under the pressure of so great poverty that the most active individual benevolevence could neither provide them with a sufficient present succour nor procure for them within a reasonable time the means of permanent settlement. The consequence was that many of those unfortunate strangers were totally lost to this county or forced by want to become noxious and dangerous to its cities whose original dispositions and qualifications if rightly directed and employed would have made them valuable and useful members of the community. Besides the accounts transmitted back to Ireland of their disappointments and destitute situations deferred many who were suffering at home the extreme of wretchedness from endeavouring to better their condition in this more fortunate and favoured land–to the political institutions of which they were also more strongly attached. A very painful reflection on these circumstances had suggested to come gentlemen then present the hope that the general Government might be induced by a strong and united application to grant a portion of its unsettled lands on terms liberal and bountiful so that an asylum might be formed for industrious and enterprising farmers who would gladly fly from famine and persecution to a spot where the sweat of their brows falling on a fertile soil would yield them a rich harvest for their own exclusive benefit and where they might peacefully enjoy all the blessings of that republication liberty they loved. The time for making such an application seemed auspicious ; party asperities had softened fown and probably few would now be led by political prejudices to give it opposition. Neither was it unprecedented ; a favour nearly similar had been granted to the French emigrants and to settlers from Switzerland. It is true we could not forth a pretence like the cultivation of the vine or the olive ; and we would not succeed by practising any delusion. We could offer nothing but an immediate accession of industrious and hardy settlers who in a congenial soil and climate would become enthusiastically attached to the country and the Government from whence they derived all their blessings and wherever they were found would form a barrier against every enemy. Much might undoubtedly be expected from the generous sympathy which the sorrows and sufferings of Ireland had everywhere excited in the United States and from the acknowledged liberality of its Constituted Authorities ; but very forcible arguments might also be addressed to its policy and interest. Not only those that in the ordinary course of events would arrive here whose usefulness is lost by the want of proper direction and who become burdens or scourges to our cities would be rescued and placed in a situation where all the energies of active and enterprising minds would be serviceable to themselves and the community ; but also the very fact that such an asylum was open and accessible would infinitely increase the amount of emigration from Ireland and people our wildernesses with incalculable rapidity. The place upon which we have fixed our eyes is in the Illinois territory–it has been lately purchased and is not yet even surveyed. In the ordinary course of events it is not likely to be brought into market (at least to any extent) for many years ; but if Congress listen to our application and grant to the settlers an extended credit Government will receive payment for the land probably as soon as if it were suffered to remain unheeded till its regular turn for sale came round. A large body of settlers will be enabled to grow rich during the time that the land would otherwise be waste and unproductive and the value of all the contiguous property belonging to the United States would be rapidly and immensely increased to say nothing of the advantages resulting from the strength of such a settled frontier. All these considerations may be strongly urged by men who can most truly say they are actuated by no views of personal speculation or emolument ; who are willing to enter into all the labour of procuring settlers and organising the establishment without any prospect of gain or even compensation except as to what may be necessary for defraying the expences of the undertaking ; and who are desirous that the actual settlers should enjoy all the advantages which Government may be willing to grant. These are our views–we conceive that they may be realized if supported by an united and active co-operation of those who think like us in other parts of the Union. We are therefore desirous of adopting and pointing out to others what seems to be the best mode of giving system to that co-operation ; namely the formation of societies totally divested of all party or political feelings and directing the attention only to this object. There are already a sufficient number of political institutions in every State in which the zealous partizan (be his opinions what they may) can act on them to their fullest extent. Let these societies be neutral groun or rather consecrated places in which when we meet we lay aside all our hostilities and join as brothers in our prayers and offerings at the shrine of our common worship. They are consecrated to every man amongst us by the purity of their object by our earliest recollections by our unbroken affection and our strongest sympathies– by the unextinguished love of our native land for which most of us have already renounced all sectarian antipathies and religious animosities ; which we offer as a solemn pledge to the country of our adoption that our hearts will be always alive from temperament as well as prin ciple to the emotions of patriotism ; and that those amongst us who have pledged their faith to her however they may seem to differ on some minor political subjects will always be found firmly ranged and united under the same banners and forming one phalanx whenever her more important interests are concerned. Mr Emmet then moved four resolutions which being severally put were carried with some slight amendments as follow :– 1. Resolved–That it is expedient to form a Society of Irishmen and descendents of Irishmen for the purpose of endeavouring to procure from Congress a track of land in the Illinois territory to be settled by emigrants from Ireland. 2. Resolved–That every person of the foregoing description who shall on or before the second day of December next pay to the Secretary of this Meeting the sum of five dollars shall be entitled to become a Member of the said Society until the number of subscribers shall have amounted to one hundred after which time the subscribers shall be at liberty to elect their own officers and no person shall afterwards be admitted except by ballot. 3. Resolved–That it be recommended in Irishmen and the descendents of Irishmen in the other cities and towns of the Union to form similar societies for the purpose of corresponding and co-operating with that which is about to be formed in this city. 4. Resolved–That as the meeting of Congress will shortly take place and in order to prevent the less of time a Committee of fifteen be appointed to prepare the outlines of a memorial to that body to be submitted to the consideration of the Society when formed and organized ; and also to adopt such measures as they may think expedient for promoting and accelebrating the organization of that Society. Mr John W. Mulligan in seconding Mr Emmet's motion expressed in handsome terms how much he was gratified by the invitation to attend had given him the opportunity of claiming his title of descendent of an Irishman. A Committee was then appointed pursuant to the fourth resolution the number being upon motion and discussion augmented to twentyone. Committee –Andrew Morris Thomas Addis Emmet William Sampson John W. Mulligan Thomas Kirk James Moffit Robert Swanton Matthew Carroll William James M'Neven Captain Skiddy Dennic M'Carthy John Meyher James M'Bride Cornelius Heeney William Paterson Colonel Mulaney David Bryson Captain O'Sullivan James J. M'Donnell Dennis H. Doyle James Hayes. A subscription paper being then opened a number of those present subscribed their names and paid five dollars as their initiation fee and became members of the association. Those persons who wish to become original members may do so by signing their names and paying their subscription to the Secretary before 2d December pursuant to the second resolution. After the meeting was adjourned the Committee organized itself and appointed Sub-Committees to report a draft of a constitution and a memorial to Congress and for the discharge of other requisite duties.  ID139,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,01,inform,Leeds April 19.–We have been somewhat alarmed here to-day though no bad consequences have followed by a most numerous assemblage of croppers cloth-dressers and other artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep com ing in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley Armley Holbeck and all the neighbouring towns and villages and it is computed that at one time there were full three thousand of these distressed people assembled chiefly in Briggate. As many of them marched into the town with great sticks in their hands they created some little alarm but their conduct was uniformly peaceable; their complaints were not loud though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and Magistrates with the whole of the Civil Power were in rea diness to act as circumstances might require; but fortunately there was not the slightest occasion for their interference. By far the greater number of the assemblage dispersed by noon and returned to their respective homes. Several respectable gentlemen went among them to ascertain the motives of their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it does not appear that they have the least disposition to commit any breath of the peace ; but in fact the people know not what to do in their present state of distress. I understand that an active subscription is going to enable a number of these poor men to proceed to Canada; and others are said to have expressed their wish to be sent to Botany Bay provided they can obtain the sanction of Government. The case of these people is a very perplexing one ; for their numbers augment daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories. Chester April 19.–John Bagguely John Drummond and Samuel Johnson convicted of sedition on the 15th inst. were this day after an adrdress from the Chief-Justice (Mr Serjeant Copley) sentenced to two years' imprisonment and to find security for their good behaviour for two years each in L.500 himself with sureties in L.100 each. We are sorry to hear that great number of the agricultural poor are out of employ in Monmouthshire and that the amount of wages diminishes as works get scarcer. Emigration to America still continues; but it is for the most part of a description of person who have afforded employ to others rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some property with them. Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States there are twenty six persons belonging to one family (Quakers of the name of Thistlewaith) lately residing in Meadow lane Leeds. These industrious and enterprising individuals are gone with an intention of carrying on the woollen manufacture (in conjunction with others) on an extensive scale either at Philadelphia or some other more eligible site in its vicinity. Several other families are preparing to emigrate from the same neighbourhood as well as from Dewsbury Bradford and other places in the vicinity. It is true these extensive emigrations may in some degree contribute to relieve our overburdened population ; but they must likewise tend in an equal ratio to impoverish the nation ; as every individual and family who emigrate setting aside the pecuniary wealth they carry with them take what is of far more consequence to a commercial nation–their talents and industry–articles at present of comparative small value in the country. The very heavy impost which is at present levied upon authors and publishers by being compelled under the existing Copyright Act to deliver eleven copies of every book published to certain public libraries is likely to be repealed by a Bill to be brought into Parliament in a few days. The body of evidence taken before the Select Committe of the House of Commons last year forms a most interesting display of the state of literary property in this country. Saturday last Mr Stuart and Mr Allsop were returned for the Borough of Camelford. Yesterday the Grand Jury for the County of Middlesex found two Bills of Indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury against five of the principal witnesses produced in behalf of the petitioner who were examined before the Select Committee appointed to try the merits of the election fo Penrhyn. Extraordinary Legacy. –A very singular cause is now depending before the Court of Session in Scotland respecting a legacy to the amount of upwards of fifty thousand pounds bequeathed by the late Earl of F. (who died at Berlin) to a foreigner who was one of his domestic servants. The payment of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the late Earl on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consideration ; and from its novelty the case is of course the subject of much conversation in the Northern Metropolis. The arguments and pleadings in this extraordinary suit in which the most eminent counsel of the Edinburgh Bar are engaged display much classical as well as legal learning ; but no judgement has yet been pronounced by the Court. From the magnitude of the sum in dispute it will probably be finally determined by an appeal to the House of Lords.– Morn. Chron. Town Hall Southwark. –Thomas Wing was brought up by Reeve the Marshalman and examined before Sir John Earner[?] the sitting Magistrate charged on suspicion of robbing his employers Messrs Sentance and Flint grocers NO. 300. Borough High-street. The prisoner's detection was caused in the following singular manner :–He was porter to the prosecutors and was frequently about the shop ; a large house dog having seen him take money from the till which he tied in his pocket handkerchief followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a shed near the stables and then he came into the shop and appeared quite restless pulling every person by the skirt[?] and apparently wishing them to follow him. At length Henry Heydon the apprentice having occasion to go to the stable the dog followed him and having drawn his attention to the heap of rubbish under which the money was buried began to scratch at it till he brought the booty to view ! The apprentice brought it to his master who counted and found it to contain 12s. in copper coin. After marking it he desired the boy to place it in the same spot which he did and soon afterwards finding that it was removed he asked the prisoner some questions about it but he declared his ignorance of the whole transaction. Reeve the Marshalman was then sent for who on searching the prisoner found some of the marked ballpence[?] in his pocket.–Remanded. Bank Committee. –The Opposition Journals last wek asserted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House of Commons intend to report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of paying in specie. That is the Bank shall pay next January in gold bars at the present price of gold L.4 1s. per ounce any quanitity of notes not being less than sixty or a hundred pounds' worth and that in two years afterwards they shall pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold L.3 17s. 10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's plan goes farther. It recommends that the Bank shall never pay in coin but in bars of gold at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall at all times buy gold when offered at L.3 17s. and sell it when demanded at L.3 17s. 10 1/2d. If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the Restriction Committee intend to report in favour of payments in bullion at the market price ; and should Parliament adopt that plan ; then there will be a very great saving to the nation in the expense of coinage the waste of &c. All the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in foreign commerce will be answered as well by payments in gold bars as by payments in coins and the danger of a domestic run on the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic as in 1797 will be completely prevented. This is indeed at all times the only danger to which it is exposed. A run for coin on the Country Banks would instantly fall on the Bank of England and would cramp if not dry upthe currency throughout the empire producing the greatest confusion. Now if the Opposition Journals be correct the currency will be placed in perfect security at perfect ease. Nothing will be able to disorder it. If persons will hoard specie they must purchase gold bars or foreign coin or content themselves with silver. In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the amount of L.800000 each year and then the value of gold was rather below the standard price. In the year 1817 we imported to the amount of six millions and in the year 1818 we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. During the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have an abundant harvest or two and little importation of corn become necessary gold will again fall very low. The Bank will then be able to pay to buy gold to the full extent of Mr Ricardo's plan and to place their notes on a firm unquestionable foundation. The finances of the continent and of the world indeed–the sources and circulation of money will during peace gradually become steadier and better known. The East Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quantity of specie while Spanish America in consequence of her troubles yields far less than usual. It would be madness to fly in the face of all these circumstances by compelling the Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may be desirable to limit the issue of bank notes to some certain yet liberal amount. We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the Committee ; but if some rumours be true we augur favourably of it. It[?] is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee and stood alone in voting against the Report. Thus then the Report cannot be in favour of a very sudden or decided plan for the resumpion of cash payments or Mr Tierney would not have voted against it ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable prospect of a rational scheme for that resumption or the other five or six Opposition Members of the Committee would not have voted for it. – Courier. Grand Pigeon Match three Gentlemen of the Midgham Club against thrice of All England took place on Monday on Farnham Downs at twenty-one birds twenty-one yards distance from the gun for 150 guineas aside charge unlimited. Messrs Adams Russel and Holt were selected from the Crack Club against Messrs King Short and Keans. The sports were as follows ; Mr Adams killed nineteen birds and the remaining two were severely hit. Russel killed eighteen but lost one three yards out of bounds and Mr Holt bagged sixteen making a grand total of fifty-two from sixty-three. The Club was at first backed to win but the England shots were now backed freely at six to four as they were considered safe eighteen bird men. Mr King killed twenty but lost two out of bounds. Short missed his first three which brought betting to two to one onn the Club but he killed the next seventeen and missed the last bird. Mr Keans had seventeen to tie and eighteen to win and he was back at five to four and at two to one after killing eleven birds in succession. He however missed the seventeenth and had to kill the other four to win. He succeeded and the prize was won by once bird. It was altogether the most interesting match of this sort known for years. Letters from Petersburgh of the 15th ultimo mention that Prince Gustavus of Sweden son of King Gustavus IV. has obtained permission from the Emperor his uncle to proceed to England for the purpose of completing his studies at Oxford. Reports speak highly of the virtues and talents of this unfortunate young Prince who excites universal interest and sympathy in the north of Europe. In these feelings we must largely share for we cannot easily forget the associations with which the name of Vasa was connected not the services rendered by two Sovereigns of that Illustrious House to the cause of civil and religious liberty. It is said that a great Potentate whose generosity and magnanimity are proverbial has settled upon Prince Gustavus an allowance of L. 2000 Sterling per annum during the residence of the latter in England and that on the return of his Royal Highness to the Continent he is to espouse his cousin a Princess of Hesse Cassel who if rumour be correct has lately refused a matrimonial alliance with the new Swedish dynasty. Papers arrivedon Saturday from New York and Boston to the 15th ult. The National Intelligencer in an article occupying five columns under the head of Strictures on Mr Lacock's Report on the Seminole War defends the sanguinary proceedings of General Jackson. This production is said to have excited a great sensation throughout the United States being supposed to express the sentiments of the Executive. The General had left Washington for his residence in Tenessee.

A family in Shetland consisting of the husband wife and six of a young family sold off their effects and came to Leith for the purpose of availing themselves of this opportunity to settle in the above colony. On applying to the agent however they were informed that they did not come under the description of persons wanted. Since therefore they have lived in Leith till their little all has been exhausted and the husband from the combined effects of disappointment and want has been thrown upon a sick-bed and the whole family are literally in a state of starvation. Several private individuals with a benevolence that does them the highest credit have temporarily supplied their wants ; but the hands of private charity is soon crippled and unless something else be immediately done we may have soon to report one or more of their deaths from the actual want of the necessaries of life. The object of the present notice therefore is to draw forth the sympathies of the charitable to relive a family thus suddenly involved in want and misery who from their industrious habits and every way excellent characters left their native home with the good wishes of all their friends. Any donations either in money or clothes will be thankfully received by Mr Andrew Spence of the firm of Messrs Cunninham & Spence No. 62 Tolbooth-wynd Leith.  ID300,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1841,04,07,inform,Emigration to New Zealand. –On Friday the Tyne left the London Dock and proceeded down the river on her voyage to Port Nicholson New Zealand. The Tyne is a fine new vessel and she takes out 50 mechanics and labourers with their families from the Emigration Depot at Deptford besides a number of other passengers amongst whom are Mr Swainson Chief Justice and Mr Martin Attorney-General of the new colony to which sations they have been recently appointed. The arrangements for the comfort of the emigrants on board were certainly very complete ; and it must be gratifying to know that those persons sent out by the company will be provided with a large proportion of their provisions fresh a great quantity of patent preserved provisions being shipped for that purpose on board the Tyne. There are a greater number of children than usual in the Emigration Depot–many of the families consisting of from eight to twelve individuals. The Prince Rupert which now lies in the London Dock will clear out on the 10th inst ; and it is supposed she will pretty well clear the depot of its present inmates.
