The day fixed for their departure is the 20th of March The Indian companions of Mr. Bowles are two Creeks and two Cherokees. these nations though contiguous to each other and in strict union differ as essentially as possible in language and manners. Both however entertain the most implacable animosity against the Spaniards whose authority and dominions in South America they make no scruple of avowing they mean to try to diminish.  ID322,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,08,inform,When hostilities are once commenced a for fidable armament will unquestionable be sent against the Spanish South American colonies. Of its success there cannot be a doubt when we shall be aided by an army of 20000 Indian warriors beside the active support of those Mexicans now ??? under the tyranous yoke of Spain. So determined are the Cherokees the Creeks and other nations of Indians in the Southern parts of America to strip the Spaniards of their possessions on that Continent that they will unquestionably attempt the glorious achievement even though the policy of this country should prevent us from lending them effectual assistance. The rich silver mines at Potosi in Peru were accidentally discovered in 1545 by an Indian as he was clambering up the mountain in pursuit of a Lama which had strayed from his flock. Soon after the mines of Sacotecas in New Spain little inferior to the other in value were opened. From that time successive discoveries have been made in both colonies and silver mines are now so numerous that the working of them and of some few mines of gold in the provinces of Terra Firm and the new Kingdom of Grenada has become the capital occupation of the Spaniards and is reduced into the system no less complicated than interesting.  ID345,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,05,24,entertain,NOOTKA SOUND. The circumstances of thetrade and situation of this part of North America being a matter of such general conversation and great public moment we are particularly happy in being enabled to give some further account of the transactions that have happened at Nootka Sounds as well as to point out the advantages that were likely to be extended to other places by the means of this trade. It is necessary to remark that the skin of the sea otter is worn only in the Northern regions of China. Its fur though beautiful and magnificent is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the Southern Provinces. Pekin is therefore the proper mart for this valuable commodity and in this immense city the consumption is so great that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale. The Mandarins of the Court and even the Emperor himself are fond of wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury. The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds that all the blankets cloths hats and stockings that could be procured in China if English manufacture were sold to the Indians with whose Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed. An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to be recorded. The Spaniards discovering that Callicum a Chief second in authority at Nootka Sound was in alliance with the English he was shot through the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife of Callicum with an infant child escaped but not till wounded. Macquilla the Chief first in command retired at the head of the allies of England from Nootka Sound and to avoid the cruelty of the Spaniards they fled to distant parts. Such of the natives as they could seize the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications. At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. And we further add on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain Mears the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines. Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of Kamschatka and other ports belonging to the Russians with the teas and other produce of China. This promised to be an invaluable channel of commerce as the Chinese have shut their ports against the Russians who On this voyage of discovery and experiment one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo but was unfortunately lost on her return to China. To these curious particulars we add with a patriot joy that the consumption of the glorious staple of England her broad cloths is astonishingly great in Japan and China: British hard ware &c. is also in great request. From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility. This Prince is six feet 4 1/2 inches high of proportionate bulk.
