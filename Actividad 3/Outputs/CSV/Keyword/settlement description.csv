Indeed they procure too easily to be frugal in their out-givings. All the manufactured goods imported from Europe are from Britain and they cannot have goods equal in quality and price from any other place. I think I never say so many children as are in this country every town village and farm-house are full of them.–The people of this country increase like rabbits: It is supposed they double their numbers every fifteen years; but I should think they do it in a shorter period.–What a grand prospect for the sale of British goods for when so many hundreds of millions of acres of land lye idle to be granted or purchased at a small price the people of this country never will manufacture ; At present wages are high and 1000 acres of land in the back settlements may be purchased for as many pence?.  ID18,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,09,21,persuade,A short DESCRIPTION of and REMARKS upon a new State called THE WESTERN TERRITORY being one of four settled by the Americans since 1774. T HAT no nation can serve the Americans with goods equal in quality and price to Britain is wha the whole world knows and from experience the most obstinate rebel American dare not deny: It is with pleasure therefore we inform our readers that the United States are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures–They have already laid out four new States since the beginning of their rebellion viz. Vermont Kentucky Indiana and The Western Territory. About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky ten years ago lay in forest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has been the population that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants already in each of these states. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year in 1789 and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States published in America in May last we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them called The Western Territory ; and it must rerejoice the heart of every Briton to read it and think that the settling of these countries though the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 20 years will long keep them from manufacturing and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman even though wages are very high when he can for twenty pounds purchase a thousand acres of land that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect that new channels of commerce will be opened and the inland parts of the Continent will require an increasing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation will be diffused through a country more fertile more extensive than all the Thirteen United States. The Western Territory Is the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river –north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania? south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains according to Mr. Hutchins Geographer General to the Congress 411000 square miles equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres from which he deducts forth-three millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hundred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the fed–ral government which is to be sold for the discharge of the debt owing to the United States. But a very small proportion of these lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*. On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements are already commenced–one at Marietta the other at Miami. This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787 and already contains above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi Ohio Muskingham Hockhocking Sioto Miami Wobash&c–Coal and iron mines and salt pits abound in this State; the soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy pleasant and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States. The timber is tall and in great variety?Streams for mills abound here. Wheat indigo hemp and cotton thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties and fulfill the description of travellers who call it the garden of the world. It is here probably also that the center of a great empire will be fixed in some future period. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accommodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with wild game of every kind; herds of deers elks bears &c fill the extensive meadows of thie country?turkies geese swans and partridges &c. are innumerable. The rivers are excellently stored with fish and almost all navigable for small sloops. In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30000 persons; and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States. Rejoice O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you and you only! * No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum.  ID32,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,11,inform,Mr. Ephraim Daniel of Baker's-row Mileend received the following letter from a friend in Holland last week: Sir your friend L–y who is just come here from the East Indies desires me to inform you that your unfortunate relation who left you with the transports for Botany Bay was well in February last. He has settled at Port Jackson and has leave to teach the children of some of your nation to read and write in your own way. The place is much improved since you ahve had any letters form it as there was no person without a habitation and being in some order when he left it. Except wearing apparel very little is wanting but business ; but you may thank the Dutch at Batavia for it as they have brought several useful things there. The last crops of corn and the garden grounds were in very good condition : and what makes the settlement more convenient one of the people who came in the first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for use and ornament as the clay is equally good as that of Delft or elsewhere. He was surprised to see so many people without hats or shoes and houses without windows and full of wicker and rush furniture which is used in the place of almost every thing else. If the smiths had a plentiful supply of coal and iron hardly any utensils would be wanting. Your nephew has two children and says all that are born there are very healthy and more born than are buried or executed of grown people. The Christians Church was quite finished before he came away ; and he thinks if there were enough of your people they might have a place to themselves. The farthest of the lines was seldom visited by the savages ; and it was reported when he came away that as soon as more troops and a new Governor comes over they would go farther than ever up the country when some valuable discovers are expected to be made ; they have a gum which may be used for gum arabic which is veyr useful. He expects several of your people will go from Batavia to settle there very soon ; and wonders a way for sending old clothes is not yet found out. Norfolk Island is os thinly inhabited that it is not worth a stranger's while to land there ; and as little is said about it there as if it was as far off as Europe &c. &c.  ID47,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,inform,Governor Philips describes Port Jackson which is only about nine miles to the Northward of Botany Bay in South Wales on the Coast of Holland as one of the finest harbours in the world in which 1000 sail of the line might ride in perfect security. Sydney cove named so in honour of Lord Sydney the Governor chose in preference which is about hal a mile in length and a quarter of a mile across at the entrance. Here was the finest spring water and ships can anchor so close in short that at a very small expence quays may be constructed at which the largest vessels may constantly unload. His meeting with the natives here was friendly and uninterrupted. The appearance of the place was picturesque and pleasing and it afforded an ample harvest for botanical acquisitions.  ID57,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,07,inform,Extract of a letter from a Gentleman at CharlesTown South Carolina September 2 1789 to a friend in Bristol. My inclination has taken such a stubborn longing after your side of the water that I cannot enjoy tranquility here. So very wretched have I been at times that I can hardly support the regret I feel that I ever changed the bright and alluring varieties of cultivation England for the dreary the desolate scenes of America. Happy are those who have quitted this land of misery ; and I belive a situation here is not found enviable by the greatest patriots in the State. They are all in the secret sighing for the comforts of Old England. A bare pittance there would be preferable to the largest possessions here.  ID69,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,08,16,inform,By recent letters from America we learn that the Congress of the nited States after warm debates in both Houses particularly in that of the Representatives passed an act for the purpose of fixing permanently their seat of Government at German Town in Pennsylvania. The two new provinces in North America Kentucky and Vermont whose population already is so very considerable were formed by the vast numbers of inhabitants who fled from the destruction and ravages of the unhappy contest between Great Britain and her colonies and though the greatest part of them were then deemed loyalists yet they have now jooined the American confederation. Seated on the banks of the great river Mississippi far to the westward of all the other states they can either navigate northerly to the lakes or southerly to the Spanish settlements on the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and carry on a lucrative trade with the Indians. They are possessed of as fertile a tract of country as any in the world the position of which they??? also s???d by navigable rivers to Maryland Virginia and Pennsylvania and from thence as their views???tend to every country in Europe. Thus from the most distressed situation to rise to opulence and independence ina few years must excite admiration. Agriculture at present seems to be the peculiar province of American industry from whence wealth will flow into every part of that vast country as it abounds in large tracts of rich land level grounds with a deep soil and extended savannahs; while to the northward the fisheries and shipbuilding amply compensate for the want of an equal fertility; and though not so abundant in coin yet the provinces produce the finest meadows form whence a provision trade will be every year increasing. The southern countries of Europe not affording sufficient crops of grain for the support of their inhabitants on account of the remarkable encrease of population and which is still augmenting as arts and manufacturers are every where extended: America may therefore be deemed in future the granary of this quarter of the globe.  ID102,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1802,07,01,inform,New South Wales The following particulars respecting this flourishing colony will not be unacceptable to our readers :– We are informed by Lieutenant Grant who is lately arrived from New South Wales of the flourishing state of that colony ; he left Port Jackson in November last when the crops were very luxuriant and beginning to be cut down without having suffered that year from the floods. Governor King had opened a communication with Otaheite for the purpose of supplying the colony with pork in which he had been singularly successful his Majesty's armed ship Porpoise having made one trip and the Norfolk brig having sailed on the same employ previous to Mr Grant's leaving Sydney. The most friendly understanding exists between the natives of Otaheite and the settlement of New South Wales. We are happy to hear that the latter country is longer in want of a staple commodity the article of coals of an excellent kind being found in abundance in Hunter's River together with plenty of wood well qualified for the masting of shipping. Mr Grant made his passage to the Cape of Good Hope round Cape Horn in the brig Anna Josepha loaded with spars for masts and coals which latter sold immediately at the Cape at 36 rix dollars per ton (nearly 6l. sterling.) Governor King had formed a small settlement at Hunter's River for the purpose of working the coal which is of the same nature with that of Newcastle. Mr Grant entered this river in the Lady Nelson in order to obtain the survey of it. He penetrated in his boats nearly seventy miles up the same accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Paterson without being able at that time to discover its source. A wood resemblingsustic had also been found. Mr Grant in his passage from England to Port Jackson in the Lady Nelson a vessel of only 60 tons burthen with three sliding keels and built on Captain Schank's construction was the first that passed through the straits which separate Van Diemens Land from New Holland and sailed along a great extent of coast to the westward of any land before seen by those who had visited that country going into no higher latitude than 39. 30. fourth ; and observes that the fourth cape of New Holland lies in 39. 2. fourth. He found those he sailed along bold with very deep water wherever he attempted to land ; and in general he had with a very moderate offing from 50 10 45 and 30 fathoms water fine land and sometimes shells. By order of Governor King he returned into those straits and obtained the survey of the coast from Wilson's Promontory to Western Port with the survey of that harbour which is well sheltered and capable of containing many sail of shipping. There is abundance of wood easily to be got and plenty of water ; though the latter is rather difficult to be procured on account of the distance and from several shoals lying in the way which render it necessary to take advantage of tide. Mr Grant gives a very favourable report of that part of the country.  ID112,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1814,05,26,inform,A proclamation issued by Governor Macquarrie appears in the Sidney Gazette of 14th May stating that Peter Mills Acting Deputy Surveyor of Lands at Port Dalrymple Van Dieman's Land and George Williams Acting Deputy Commissary of Stores and provisions at the said settlement had absconded from their habitations and fled to the woods ; that their object was to live by rapine and violence ; to effect which they had armed themselves and taken the command of a gang of 26 desperadoes with whose aid they had committed numerous robberies–entering the lands of settlers driving away their cattle and plundering their houses. The proclamation declares that those who shall return to their houses and occupations before 1st December next shall be pardoned and saved harmless from all offences except the crime of wilful murder ; and denounces those who shall disregard this offer as outlaws. Sydney New South Wales Jan. 4. The Argo has arrived with a most extensive supply of tea viz 167 chests of souchong 200 ditto bobea 200 hyson skin and young hyson 50 ; in all 617 chests. The consequences has been a reduction in the price of souching from 30s to 5s per lb currency. Shortly prior to the Argo's departure from the Island of Mauritius the Hope American ship laden with tea and sundies valued at L80000 was captured by his Majesty's sloop Harpy Captain Allen. In consequences of the oppressive conduct of several masters of colonial and British ships and of their crews towards the natives of New Zealand of Otaheite and of the other islands in the South Pacific Ocean which have led to the destruction of several vessels with their crews by the natives and disturbed all trade and intercourse with those islands both by British shipping and that ofthe allied powers–his Excellency has forbidden any vessel to clear out from any place in New South Wales without a bond given by the master or owner to the naval officer for the time being at the port for L.1000 sterling binding him and his crew not to commit any act of hostility or to be guilty of any trespass or forment any animosities between the natives or take any part in any war that may prevail ; nor forcibly carry away any male or female inhabitants of the islands under penalty of forfeiting the sum specified in the bond. A small party who a short time ago undertook[?] a land passage in a direction towards Broken Bay for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and fertility of the country have discovered an excellent grazing track of 8000acres. In consequence of which one gentlemen Mr Robert Campbell has already sent thither an extensive herd of cattle and this example is likely to be followed by others. Thomas West who came to this colony a convict for life in the ship Earl Cornwall's[?] in 1801 has received from his Excellency a conditional pardon in consideration of his general good conduct and character for sobriety and industry and also in consideration of his having lately erected a water mill for the grinding of grain at Barcorn Glen within two miles of Sydney being the first water mill ever erected in the vicinty of this town. Sydney New South Wales May 21. The good understanding between the natives and our settlers which had been maintained for the last six years has given place to frequent outrages attended with fatal consequences. On Saturday a body of 60 natives commenced plundering the fields of a settler when three privates of the veteran battalion fired upon them and killed a boy. The narushed upon them before they could load again and killed on private Isaac Eustace and compelled the other two to fly. They then plundered the ground of Messrs Milehouse and Butcher. Next day a party of 14 soldiers falling in with them shot a woman and two children–the savages attacked William Baker a stock-keeper of Mr MacArthur killed the man and two women named Sullivan and Herburg. Sydney New South Wales Feb. 12. On Monday last arrived the ship General Hewett Captain Earle from England having a detachment of the 46th regiment commanded by Major Oglivie ; and yesterday arrived the Windham Captain Bligh also from England having on board the head-quarters of the 46th regiment commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Molle who succeeded Lieutenant-Colonel O'Connell as Lieutenant-Governor of the territory and is accompanied by Mrs Molle and family ; also Lieutenant Walters of the navy agent for transports– Of the 300 convicts which the General Hewett received on board 35 died on the passage.  ID117,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1816,01,15,inform,New South Wales A journey into the interior of New South Wales across the Blue Mountains performed by his Excellency Colonel Mac quarrie Governor of the settlement. From the official account dated Sydney June 10. 1815. The Governor desires to communicate for the information of the public the result of his late tour over the Western or Blue Mountains undertaken for the purpose of being enabled personally to appreciate the importance of the track of country lying westward of them which had been explored in the latter end of the year 1813 and beginning of 1814 by Mr George William Evans Deputy Surveyor of Lands. To those who know how very limited a track of country has been hitherto occupied by the colonists of New South Walves extending along the eastern coast to the north and south of Port Jackson only 80 miles and westward about 40 miles to the foot of that chain of mountains in the interior which forms its western boundary it must be a subject of astonishment and regret that amongst so large a population no one appeared within the first twenty-five years of the establishment of this settlement possessed of sufficient energy of mind to induce him fully to explore a passage over these mountains ; but when it is considered that for the greater part of that time even this circumscribed portion of country afforded sufficient produce for the wants of the people whilst on the other hand the whole surface of the country beyond those limits was a thick and in many places nearly an impenetrable forest the surprise at the want of effort to surmount such difficulties must abate very considerably. The records of the colony only afford two instances of any bold attempt having been made to discover the country to the westward of the Blue Mountains. The first was by Mr Bass and the other by Mr Caley and both ended in disappointment; a cirumstance which will not be much wondered at by those who have lately crossed these mountains. To Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth Esqrs. and Liutenant Lawson of the Royal veteran company the merit is due of having with extraordinary patience and much fatigu effected the first passage over the most rugged and difficult part of the Blue Mountains. The Governor being strongly impressed with the importance of the object had early after his arrival in this colony formed the resolution of encouraging the attempt to find a passage to the western country and willingly availed himself of the facilities which the discoveries of these three gentlemen afforded him. Accordingly on the 20th of November 1813 he entrusted the accomplishment of this object to Mr George William Evans deputy surveyor of lands the result of whose journey was laid before the public through the medium of the Sydney Gazette on the 12th of February 1814. The favourable account given by Mr Evans of the country he had explored induced the Governor to cause a road to be constructed for the passage and conveyance of cattle and provisions to the interior ; and men of good character from amongst a number of convicts who had volunteered their services were selected to perform this arduous work on condition of being fed and clothed during the continuance of their labour and being granted emancipations as their final reward on the completion of the work. The direction and superintendence of this great work was entrusted to William Cox. Esq. the chief magistrate at Windsor ; and to the astonishment of every one who knows what was to be encountered and sees what has been done he effected its completion in six months from the time of its commencement happily without the loss of a man or any serious accident. The Governor is at a loss to appreciate fully the services rendered by Mr Cox to this colony in the execution of this arduous work which promises to be of the greatest public utility by opening a new source of wealth to the industrious and enterprising. When it is considered that Mr Cox voluntarily relinquished the comforts of his own house and the society of his numerous family and exposed himself to much personal fatigue with only such temporary covering as the bark hut could afford from the inclemency of the season it is difficult to express the sentiments of approbation to which such privations and services are entitled. Mr Cox having reported the road as completed on the 21st of January the Governor accompanied by Mrs Macquarrie and that gentleman commenced his tour on the 25th of April last over the Blue Mountains and was joined by Sir John Jamieson at the Nepean who accompanied him during the entire tour. The following gentlemen composed the Governor's suite: Mr Campbell Secretary ; Captain Antill Major of Brigade ; Lieutenant Watts Aide decamp ; Mr Redfern Assistant-Surgeon ; Mr Oxley Surveyor-General ; Mr Mehan Deputy Surveyor-General ; Mr Lewin Painter and Naturalist ; and Mr G. Evans Deputy Surveyor of lands who had been sent forward for the purpose of making further discoveries and rejoined the party on the day of arrival at Bathurst Plains. The commencement of the ascent from Emu Plains to the first depot and thence to a resting place now called Spring Wood distant twelve miles from Emu Ford was through a very handsome open forests of lofty trees and much more practicable and easy than was expected. The facility of the ascent for this distance excited surprise and is certainly not well calculated to give the traveller a just idea of the difficulties he has afterwards to encounter. At a further disstance of four miles a sudden change is perceived in the appearance of the timber and the quality of the soil the former becoming stunted and the latter barren and rocky. At this place the fatigues of the journey may be said to commence. Here the country became altogether mountainous and extremely rugged. Near to the 18th mile (it is to be observed that the measure commences at Emu Ford) a pile of stones attracted attention. It is close to the line of road on the top of a rugged and abrupt ascent and is supposed to have been placed there by Mr Caley as the extreme limit of his tour. Hence the Governor gave that part of the mountain the name as Caley's[?] Repulse. To have penetrated even so far was at that time an effort of no small difficulty. From henceforward to the 26th mile is a succession of steep and rugged hills some of which are almost so abrupt as to deny a passage altogether ; but at this place a considerable extensive plain is arrived at which constitutes the summit of the western mountains ; and from thence a most extensive and beautiful prospect presents itself on all sides to the eye. The town of Windsor the river Hawkesbury Prospect Hill and other objects within that part of the colony now inhabited of equal interest are distinctly seen from hence. The majestic grandeur of the situation combined with the various objects to be seen from this place induced the Governor to give it the appellation of the King's Table Land. On the south-west side of the King's Table Land the mountain terminates in abrupt precipices of immense depth at the bottom of which is seen a glen as romantically beautiful as can be imagined bounded on the further side by mountains of great magnitude terminating equally abruptly as the others and the whole thickly covered with wood. The length of this picturesque and remarkable track of country is about 24 miles to which the Governor gave the name of the Prince Regent's Glen. Proceeding hence to the thirty-third mile on the top of a hill an opening presents itself on the south-west side of the Prince Regent's Glen from whence a view is obtained particularly beautiful and grand–mountains rising beyond mountains with stupendous masses of rock in the fore ground here strike the eye with admiration and astonishment. The circular form in which the whole is so wonderfully disposed induced the Governor to give the name of Pitt's Amphitheatre (in honour of the Right Hon. William Pitt) to this offset of branch from the Prince Regent's Glen. The road continues from hence for the space of 17 miles on the ridge of the mountain which forms one side of the Prince Regent's Glen and there it suddenly terminates in nearly a perpendicular precipice of 676 feet high as ascertained by measurement. The road constructed by Mr Cox down this rugged and tremendous descent through all its windings is no less than three-fourths of a mile in length and has been executed with such skill and stability as reflects much credit on him. The labour here undergone and the difficulties surmounted can only be appreciated by those who view this scene. In order to perpetuate the memory of Mr Cox's services the Governor deemed it a tribute justly due to him to give his name to this grand and extraordinary pass and he accordingly called it Cox's Pass. Having descended into a valley at the bottom of this pass the retrospective view of the overhanging mountain is magnificently grand. Although the present pass is the only practicable point yet discovered for descending by yet the mountain is much higher than those on either side of it from whence it is distinguished at a considerable distance when approaching it from the interior and in this point of view it has the appearance of a very high distinct hill although it is in fact only the abrupt termination of a ridge. The Governor gave the name of Mount York to this termination of the ridge in honour of his Royal Highness the Duke of York. On descending Cox' Pass the Governor was much gratified by the appearance of good pasture land and soil fit for cultivation which was the first he had met with since the commencement of his tour. The valley at the base of Mount York he called the Vale of Clwyd in consequence of the strong resemblance it bore to the vale of that name in North Wales. The grass in this vale is of a good quality and very [?]dant and a rivulet of fine water runs along it from the eastward which unites itself at the western extremity of the vale with another rivulet containing still more water. The junction of these two streams forms a very handsome river now called by the Governor Cox's River which takes its course as has been since ascertained through the Prince Regent's Glen and empties itself into the river Nepean ; and it is conjectured from the nature of the country through which it passes that it mut be one of the principal causes of the floods which have been occasionally felt on the low banks of the river Hawkesbury into which the Nepean discharges itself. The Vale of Clwyd from the base of Mount York extends six miles in a westerly direction and has its termination at Cox's River. Westward of this river the country again becomes hilly but it is generally open forest land and very good passage. Three miles to the westward of the Vale of Clwyd Messrs Blaxland Wentworth and Lawson had formerly terminated their excursion ; and when the various difficulties are considered which they had to contend with especially until they had effected the descent from Mount York to which place they were obliged to pass through a thick brush-wood where they were under the necessity of cutting a passage for their baggage horses the severity of which labour had seriously affected their healths their patient endurance of such fatigue cannot fail to excite much surprise and admiration. In commemoration of their merits three beautiful high hills joining each other at the end of their tour at this place have receieved their names in the following order viz. Mount Blaxland Wentworth's Sugar Loaf and Lawson's Sugar Load. A range of very lofty hills and narrow vallies alternately form the track of country from Cox's River for a distance of 16 miles until the Fish River is arrived at ; and the stage between these rivers is consequently very severe and oppressive on the cattle. To this range the Governor gave the name of Clarence Hilly Range. Proceeding from the Fish River and at a short distance from it a very singular and beautiful mountain attracts the attentions its summit being crowned with a large and very extraordinary looking rock nearly circular in form which gives the whole very much the appearance of a hill fort such as are frequent in India. To this lofty hill Mr Evans who was the first European discoverer gave the name of Mount Evans. Passing on from hence the country continues hilly but affords good pasturage gradually improving to Sidmouth Valley which is distant from the pass of the Fish RIver eight miles. The land here is level and the first met with unencumbered with timber. It is not of very considerable extent but abounds with a great variety of herbs and plants such as would probably highly interest and gratify the scientific botanist. The beautiful little valley runs northwest and south-east between hills of easy ascent thinly covered with timber. Leaving Sidmouth Valley the country becomes again hilly and in other respects resembles very much the country to the eastward of the valley for some miles. Having reached Campbell River distant 13 miles from Sidmouth Valley the Governor was highly gratified by the appearance of the country which there began to exhibity an open and extensive view of gently rising grounds and fertile plains. Judging from the height of the banks and its general width the Campbell River must be on some occasions of very considerable magnitude ; but the extraordinary drought which has apparently prevailed on the western side of the mountains equally as throughout this colony for the last three years has reduced this river so much that it may be more properly called a chain of pools than a running stream at the present time. In the reaches or pools of the Campbell River the very curious animal called the Paradox or Water Mole is seen in great numbers. The soil on both banks is uncommonly rich and the grass is consequently luxuriant. Two miles to the southward of the line of road which crosses the Campbell River there is a very fine rich track of low lands which has been named Mitchell Plains. Flax was found here growing in considerable quanities. The Fish River which forms a junction with the Campbell River a few miles to the northward of the road and bridge over the latter has also two very fertile plains on its banks the one called O'Connel Plains and the other Macquarrie Plains both of considerable extent and very capable of yielding all the necessities of life. At the distance of seven miles from the bridge over the Campbell River Bathurst Plains open to the view presenting a rich track of champaign country of 11 miles in length bounded on both sides by gently rising and very beautiful hills thinly wooded. The Macquarrie River which is constituted by the junction of the Fish and Campbell River takes a winding course through the Plains which can be easily traced from the high lands ajoining by the particular verdure of the trees on its banks which are likewise the only trees throughout the extent of the plains. The level and clean surface of these plains gives them at first view very much the appearance of lands in a state of cultivation. It is impossible to behold this grand scene without a feeling of admiration and surprise whilst the silence and solitude which reign in a space of such extent and beauty as seems designed by Nature for the occupancy and comfort of man created a degree of melancholy in the mind which may be more easily imagined than described. The Governor and suite arrived at these Plains on Thursday the 4th of May and encamped on the southern or left bank of the Macquarrie River–the situation being selected in consequence of its commanding a beautiful and extensive prospect for many miles in every direction around it. At this place the Governor remained for a week which time he occupied in making excursions in different directions through the adjoining country on both sides the river. On Sunday the 7th of May the Governor fixed on a site suitable for the erection of a town at some future period to which he gave the name of Bathurst in honour of the present Secretary of State for the Colonies. The situation of Bathurst is elevated sufficiently beyond the reach of any floods which may occur and is at the same time so near to the river on its south bank as to derive all the advantages of its clear and beautiful stream. The mechanics and settlers of whatever description who may be hereafter permitted to form permanent residences to themselves at this place will have the highly important advantages of a rich and fertile soil with a beautiful river flowing through it for all the uses of man. The Governor mut however add that the hopes which were once so sanguinely entertained of this river becoming navigable to the Western Sea have ended in disappointment. During the week that the Governor remained at Bathurst he made daily excursions in various directions ; one of these extended 22 miles in a south-west direction and on that occasion as well as on all the others he found the country chiefly composed of vallies and plains separated occasionally by ranges of low hills; the soil throughout being generally fertile and well circumstanced for the purpose of agriculture or grazing. The Governor here feels much pleasure in being enabled to communicate to the public that the favourable reports which he had received of the country to the west of the Blue Mountains have not been by any means exaggerated. The difficulties which present themselves in the journey from hence are certainly great and inevitable but thsoe persons who may be inclined to become permanent settlers there will probably content themselves withvisiting this part of the colony but rarely and of course will have them seldom to encounter. Plenty of water and a sufficiency of grass are to be found in the mountains for the support of such cattle as may be sent over them ; and the tracks of fertile soil and rich pasturage which the new country affords are fully extensive enough for any increase of population and stock which can possibly take place for many years. Within a distance of ten miles from the site of Bathurst there is not less than 50000 acres of land clear of timber and fully one half of that may be considered excellent soil well calculated for cultivation. It is a matter of regrets that in proportion as the soil improves the timber degenerates ; and it is to be remarked that everywhere to the westward of the mountains it is much inferior both in size and quality to that within the present colony ; there is however a sufficiency of timber of tolerable quality within the district around Bathurst for the purposes of house-building and husbandry. The Governor has here to lament that neither coals nor limestone have been yet discovered in the western country ; articles in themselves of so much importance that the want of them must be severely felt whenever that country shall be settled. Having enumerated the principal and most important features of this new country the Governor has now to notice some of its live productions. All around Bathurst abounds in a variety of game ; and the two principal rivers contain a great quantity of fish but all of one denomination resembling the perch in appearance and of a delicate and fine flavour not unlike that of a rock cod. This fish grows to a large size and is very voracious. Several of them were caught during the Governor's stay at Bathurst and at the halting place on the Fish River. One of those caught weight 17 lb ; and the people stationed at Bathurst stated that they had caught some weighing 25 lb. The field game are the kangaroos emus black swans wild geese wild turkies bustards ducks of various kinds quail bronze and other pigeons &c. &c. The water mole or paradox also abounds in all the rivers and ponds. The site designed for the towns of Bathurst by observation taken at the Flag Staff which was erected on the day of Bathurst receiving that name is situated in latitude 33. 24. 30. south being also 27 1/2 miles north of Government House In Sydney and 94 1/2 west of it bearing west 20. 30. north 83 geographic miles or 95 1/2 statute miles ; the measured road distance from Sydney to Bathurst being 140 English miles. The road constructed by Mr Cox and the party under him commences at Emu Ford on the left bank of the river Nepean and is thence carried 101 1/2 miles to the flag staff at Bathurst. This road has been carefully measured and each mile regularly marked on the trees growing on the left side of the road proceeding towards Bathurst. The Governor in his tour made the following stages in which he was principally regulated by the consideration of having good pasturage for the cattle and plenty of water :– 1st stage–Spring Wood distant from Emu Ford 12 miles 2d stage ditto–Jamieson's Valley or 2d depot distant from ditto . . . . . . . . . . 28 3d ditto–Blackheath distant from ditto . . . 41 4th ditto–Cox's River distant from ditto . . .56 5th ditto–The Fish River distant from ditto . 72 6th ditto–Sidmouth Valley distant from ditto . 80 7th ditto–Campbell River distant from ditto . 91 8th ditto–Bathurst distant from ditto . . . 101 1/2 At all of which places the traveller may assure himself of good grass and water in abundance. On Thursday the 11th of May the Governor and suite set out from Bathurst on their return and arrived at Sidney on Friday the 19th Ult. The Governor deems it expedient here to notify to the public that he does not mean to make any grants of land to the westward of the Blue Mountains until he shall receive the commands of his Majesty's Ministers on that subject and in reply to the report he is now about to make them upon it. In the mean time such gentlemen or other respectable free persons as may wish to visit this new country will be permitted to do so on making a written application to the Governor to that effect who will order them to be furnished with written passes. It is at the same time strictly ordered and directed that no person whether civil or military shall attempt to travel over the Blue Mountains without having previously applied for and obtained permission in the above prescribed form. The military guard stationed at the first depot on the mountains will receive full instructions to prevent the progress of any persons who shall not have obtained regular passes. The necessity for the establishing and strictly enforcing this regulation is too obvious to every one who will reflect on it to require any explanation here. The Governor cannot conclude this account of his tour without offering his best ackowledgements to William Cox Esq. for the important services he has rendered to the colony in so short a period of time by opening a passage to the new discovered country and at the same time assuring him that he shall have great pleasure in recommending his meritorious services on this occasion to the favourable consideration of his Majesty's Ministers.  ID130,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,12,28,persuade,Our paper of Thursday last contained a general view of some of the most popular publications on the subject of emigration and we shall now endeavour briefly to make an estimate of the good and evil which is likely to befall those who embark in this hazardous adventure. There is one important fact which we gather from all the accounts of America whether written for the purpose of praise or censure namely that there is a great demand for labour and that wages are high and this effect is necessarily produced y the vast space of fertile and unoccupied territory which lies westward of the United States towards the Pacific Ocean. It is this vacant territory which is the true spring of this American community. Here is the grand outlet for the superflouous population both of the eastern states of America and of Europe. To cultivate this waste there is a constant demand for new labourers ; wages are of course high – the labourer lives in comfort and if he is industrious he becomes in his turn a purchaser of land from the savings which he accumulates. If labour should become more plentiful and wages should fall this is the signal for new emigrations ; and thus this constant demand for labour in the western districts regulates its general price throughout the United States. In these circumstrances it is clear that a labourer provided he can reach this advantageous market for his labour will unquestionably improve his condition. But herein lies the difficulty. A labourer has seldom the means of of subsistence so far beforehand as to enable him to undertake so long a journey ; and if he enters upon the enterprise with insufficient means he is liable to starve before he can transport himself to his ultimate destination or he is forced to contract for immediate subsistence obligations little short of servitude under the weight of which he is grievously oppressed. These then form strong objections to emigrations in the case of those who are stinted to their means ; but where these objections can be surmounted those who can transport their labour from the overstocked market of Europe to the understocked market of America will unquestionably dispose of it to better advantage ; but if they have not the means they may as furely fail in the attempt and draw upon themselves aggravated misery and want. As to the consequences of emigration to this country we hold them rather to be beneficial than otherwise and we cannot easily account for the very absurd alarm which has been propagated on this subject. The evil in Europe is that every country is overcrowded with labourers who cannot find employment ; and is it not manifest therefore that the withdrawing of some of these will make more room for the labourers that remain – that the loss of those useless hands will rather be a relief to the body politic and will diffuse greater soundness and vigour through all its parts? That these effects will follow from emigration in this or in any other country in Europe we cannot doubt – and that the labourer if he can afford the expence of the journey will receive higher wages in America than in this country is equally clear. There is another class of adventurers who may possibly improve their circumstances by emigration although this is not so certain namely farmers with a moderate capital. An allotment of land may be purchased in the back parts of America at the Government price of two dollars per acre and an emigrant who can afford to but and to cultivate 100 or 200 acres and acts with proper judgement and skill may undoubtedly by a speculation of this sort be sure of a subsistence while by the continued emigrations from the eastern states the country being quickly settled all around him his property is daily improving in value. But a want of judgement in the purchase or a want of ability to cultivate the land after it is purchased may involve him in irrecoverable distress and ruin ; and to avoid these hazards no little discrimination and prudence is necessary. Such are some of the most striking advantages of emigration and we shall now state some of its disadvantages. The first and chief of these is the difficulty of effecting a settlement and of subsisting until the land which is purchased yields its first produce. The country is partly open ground or prairie as it is called or it is covered with almost boundless forests. A settlement in the woods requires incredible labour to clear it – labour is dear and not easily procured and this herculean task naturally devolves on the head of the family who is forced during the day to ply the axe in this laborious drudgery of felling trees and afterwards to follow the chace for a meal to his family. Here he must frequently sleep out in the woods ; and his body exhausted with his day's labour is exposed to the cold dews of night ; under such unintermitted toil his health declines and it is obvious that his family deprived even for a single day of his exertions must be reduced to the most deplorable straits. In many parts the country which is marked out for emigrants is extremely unhealthy in particular the banks of all the navigable rivers which afford the most eligible settlements both in point of fertility and situation are exposed to the most fatal maladies. The same causes which produce fertility produce disease. The overflowing of the waters from the autumnal and spring floods fertilise the land in a most wonderful degree ; but the exhalations of these stagnant waters under a burning sun are as fatal to the health as the deposits which they leave are favourable to the soil. Hence the many minute directions which are given to all emigrants in regard to their health. In a letter contained in the Emigrant's Guide we have the following advice to those who are descending the Ohio : If the weather becomes warm guard well against the smell of bilge water. But if you must descend in the spring go early – avoid all delay and remember you are fleeing for your lives. I have seen the havoc and I believed it not till then. Again it is observed Let nothing tempt you to fish in warm weather immediately on changing your climate. The effluvia of the shores is poison. To a European emigran the climate must be of course even more fatal ; and he either therefore lose his health or he must be continually tormented with anxiously taking care of it which makes it a question whether it is worth having on such terms. Such are the hardships through which if he has strength to endure them he at length emerges into ease and independence. These hardships however will no doubt be in a great measure avoided or at least mitigated if he has beforehand provided the means of subsistence until he can derive regular supplies from his own land. In this case he is less liable to be dislodged from his situation by the casualties to which all emigrants are necessarily exposed. – He is secured against the hardships of a first settlement and is more certain of attaining the wished for object of ease and affluence – To a farmer therefore or a labourer emigration presents a fair chance of a permanent settlement provided it is gone about with ordinary caution and the necessary degree of energy be exerted to insure success. But it is a gross delusion to imagine that an elysium is to be found in the United States or that mankind exist there on any more favourable terms than in this country and those who set out on any such visionary schemes are sure to meet with a woeful disappointment. With regard to other classes of society it does not appear that they will improve their condition by emigration to America ; there is no demand for clerks or professional men of any sort and no merchant has any thing to expect by removing his capital to the United States. In the back settlements there is a demand for schoolmasters to teach the ordinary branches of education and several emigrants of this class have met with good encouragement. In regard to the essential article of comfort it is apparent from all the best information on the subject that a person long resident in this country would change for the worse by an emigration to the United States. He would in the first place suffer extremely from the climate from the extreme cold of winter and the raging heat of summer the thermometer frequently standing at 98 degrees in the share with a clear sky and broiling sun and very little abatement of this exsessive heat being experienced through the night. His frame accustomed to the more temperate though unsettled climate of this country runs the risk of being debilitated by the change and at all events he must suffer extremely in his enjoyments and in his spirit from this cause. Nor we should imagine would the manners of the people in the back parts be found very agreeable or polished. It is admitted on all hands both by those who are favourable and those who are unfavourable to the Americans that if there is not as in Europe gross ignorance and debasement on the one hand neither is there on the other any thing much exalted above the ordinary level. But the inferences which arise from this established fact are strongly in favour of Europe. The grossness of vice and ignorance carries a sure antidote to its corruptions in the disgust which it excites : such examples are not so potent to debase as examples of a different sort are to purify and exalt. There is little risk that society will be contaminated by what is low and debased ; but on the other hand there is a certainty that what is exalted and illustrious in literature science taste accomplishments or fashion will exercise a powerful influence on the general state of manners. We naturally copy what we admire and those great and shining examples constitute a standard to which the whole system of life and manners has a tacit reference. In the United States they have no such models – they do not aim at so high a standard and taste and manners are therefore necessarily at a lower ebb than in Europe – Hence all accounts agree in reprobating the extreme filthy habits which universally prevail ; and Cobbett who will be suspected of too great partiality to this country draws a contrast between the inhabitants of Hampshire and those of the United States in which he places this vice of the American manners in strong colours ; and he adds as his reason for this that they have no gentlemen's seats with the fine improvements of pleasure grounds &c. dispersed through the country as models of taste and neatness for the inferior classes and it is to the same principles that we may trace other defects in their manners namely that they have no proper models on which to form themselves. Hence excepting in the principal cities we may safely conclude from all the information we have received on the subject that society has not reach the same degree of refinement as in this country. An emigrant accustomed to live in Britain would also feel the disavantages of American society strong in this that here in so closely peopled a community surrounded with all sorts of refinements life is assisted by such a variety of helps that it glides down the smooth stream of comfort and convenience without ever meeting with a single interruption. It is astonishing to what a pitch of improvement a society is brough abounding in wealth and in all the mechanical arts and where the ingenuity of thousands is incessantly on the rack to set on foot new devices for the common good. We are not duly sensible of the advantages of this because like other advantages they are familiar to us by long habit and we begin to imagine that they are inherent in the natural constitution of things. But when we are suddenly transplanted into a new community abounding indeed in subsistence but deficient in all comforts – where only the coarsest mechanic arts are practised – where the inhabitants are so widely dispersed that their common exertions cannot be made available for the common good we find life interrupted at every turn. In our former society if we had not the previous secret of transmuting all things into gold we had at least the power of transmuting gold into every thing else. But here the power of money is limited. We must indeed pay for services but we must also beg for them ; and thus we go on fretting and tormenting ourselves under petty incommodities which in this country would be remedied as soon as they were felt. It is incon ceivable how much inconvenience and discomfort and real unhappiness may spring from this cause. In this country by long habit and pracrice and continual improvement every thing has fallen into its right place – each individual has a separate task assigned him in the joint task of labouring for the general benefit – and the industry of all however variously directed tends to one common end. There is a perfect unity of effort. We all labour in common – we combine our efforts that they may yield the largest possible produce and this produce is accurately shared among the various members of the community each receiving the share to which his labour entitles him. Such is substantially the process by which commerce diffuses the benefits of industry over every civilized community. – Money is the instrument by which this division is effected. Every one who labours has the value of his labour ascertained in money which is a draft upon the common stock for whatever quantity of necessaries and luxuries he is entitled to ; and all these complicated operations are executed with a regularity almost mechanical. But in a community newly forming there is a want of unity and combination – all the members labour indeed but no one has his proper part assigned him – there is a jostling and an interference with each other – and when they come to divide some have too much and some too little of certain articles – the stock is ill assorted and money will not execute its functions. Hence disorder arises and inconvience and awkward wants and an individual suddenly removed into this region of discomfort from the happier climate of a highly improved community must be annoyed with feeling in the highest degree gloomy and disagreeable. He must have the same sensation as a person who quits an elegant mansion fitted up with every comfort and convenience for one of inferior quality and coarsely finished where he is exposed to a thousand annoyances every minute. It is observed by Dr Johnson that the evil of life does not consist in any sudden and overwhelming crash of misery but in a series of petty discomforts amd mischiefs continually preying upon the temper. The truth of this maxim those who emigrate from this country to the back woods of America will have a good opportunity of verifying. The prevalence of slavery in most of the States of the Union constitutes another capital defect in the structure of American society. These slaves form a degraded and oppressed class and in the tyranny exercised over them they themselves are morally destroyed while the corruption extends to the other orders of society equally infecting the oppressed and the oppressor and debasing the general character and habits of the people. It is vain to talk of liberty while stain of tyranny so deeply infects the domestic manners of a community. There can be no rational liberty unless we call that liberty which gives us the privilege of torturing and oppressing our fellow creatures. To give an idea of the consequences of this dreadful evil of slavery we may state that it is a practice in Kentucky to commit delinquent slaves into the hands of the public executioner by whom they are unmercifully flogged at the markey cross of the different towns the streets being filled with their pietous cries. What can we think of the people where such spectacles are for a moment tolerated. This is so utterly revolting to every just and enlightened feeling that to a European it would form a strong objection to his permanent residence in that country. In all the northern states and in some of the new states particularly that of the Ohio slavery is indeed abolished. But in several others the black form a large proportion of the population and they are not decreasing. We know indeed that this evil is admitted in its full extent by all the American statesmen that they lament it but do not well see what measures can be adopted to check it. The importation of new slaves is indeed prohibited but the increase of those already in the country is the great grievance against which it is difficult to devise a remedy and the cruel and oppressive treatment which slaves will always meet with wherever they exist must tend to degrade the habits and moral feelings of the community at large. To such therefore as are accustomed to European society where no such strain of tyranny infects the domestic manners an exchange into a community where his feelings may be revolted by spectacles of gross cruelty cannot be regarded as very desirable. If more imperious considerations permit they have certainly a greater chance for happiness by remaining where the rights of nature are respected than by removing to a society where every principle of humanity is trampled upon.  ID131,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,02,26,inform,To the Editor of the Edinburgh Weekly Journal SIR–It will be remember by many of your Readers that in the spring of 1815 proclamations were widely circulated inviting settlers to Canada.–Having myself occasion to visit this country I was curious to know what had been the result especially as I found at Quebec and Montreal very discordant accounts respecting it ; most people asserting that the scheme had failed of success and that the settlers were in a state of great discomfort and discontent.–To ascertain the truth I diverged from my route about 50 miles and spent some days at Perth situated on the waters of the Redeau to which a considerable body of the people who accepted the invitation of the Government had been conducted.– Here it traced the reported discontent to some neglect in the general management and some ill conceieved petty regulations capriciously exercised towards people tenacious of their rights ; but in the main universal satisfaction prevailed among the settlers and a strong feeling of the good intentions of Government towards them. The opportunity being a good one of ascertaining the progress which a promiscious body of settlers make in a given time. I constructed the annexed table and had each man's signature attached at once to prove to correctness of his statement and satisfaction with his situation. Should you think this worthy of publication you are welcome to publish it in your paper. It may draw attention of a most important subject–the colonization of this province with British subjects ; and it may afford satisfaction to many individuals who may not otherwise know the condition of their friends. The scheme which Government adopted in 1815 was expensive. The settlers had a free passage rations and tools. Next year rations and tools were furnished to those who came out ; and this year multitudes of poor people have come to Canada in expectation of being favoured in the same way but are disappointed ; having nothing given them but land (100 acres each) which many of them from poverty are unable to occupy. Having made it my study during three months residence here to inquire into the nature of the country and into every particular respecting settlement I am convinced that very simple measures might be adopted by which the redundant population of Britain could be conveyed by a regular flow into Canada instead of being wasted as it now is to the great prejudice of British interest over the whole of American ; and were such measures adopted this province would in a very few years be quite equal to its defence in war against the United States –I am Sir yours &c.

His first cause of quarrel is that we have stated the general want of cleanliness to be a prevailing defect in the back parts of the United States. For this we have the authority of almost every traveller who has visited those parts. The remarks of Birkbeck on this point are conclu-sive and striking: – ' In viewing the Americans (he observes) and ' sketching in a rude manner as I pass along ' their striking characteristics I have seen a de' formity so general that I cannot help esteem' ing it national though I know it admits of ve' ry many individual exceptions. I have written ' it and then erased it wishing to pass it by ' but it wont do – it is the truth and to the truth ' I must adhere. Cleanliness in houses and too ' often in person is neglected to a degree which ' is very revolting to an Englishman. ' America was bred in a cabin ; this is not a ' reproach – for the origin is most honourable ; ' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn ' logs for a framed building and that again for ' a mansion of brick some of her cabin habits ' have been unconsciously retained. Many have ' already been quitted and one by one they will ' all be cleared away as I am told they are now ' in the cities of the eastern states. ' There are I believe court-houses which ' are also made us of as places of worship in ' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating ' ever since they were built. What reverence ' can be felt for the majesty of religion or of ' the laws in such styles of abomination ? The ' people who are content to assemble in them ' can scarcely respect each other. Here is a bad ' public example. It is said that to clean those ' places is the office of no one. But why is no ' person appointed ? Might it not be inferred ' that a disregard to the decencies of life prevails ' through such a community?' To the same purpose Cobbett complains of the ' general (for there are many exceptions) sloven' liness about the homsteads and particularly ' about the dwellings of labourers. Mr Birkbeck ' complains of this and indeed what a contrast ' with the homesteads and cottages which he left ' behind him near the exemplary spot Guild' ford in Surrey.' He then proceeds to give the reasons for this. When the first settlers took possession of the country the ' example of neat' ness (he observes) was wanting. There were ' no gentlemn's gardens kept as clean as ' drawing-rooms with grass as even as a car' pet. From endeavouring to imitate perfec' tion men arrive at mediocrity ; and those who ' never have seen or heard of perfection in these ' matters will naturally be slovens.' He afterwards remarks – ' The market day at Guildford is a perfect ' show of cleanliness. Not even a carter without ' even a clean smock-frock and closely shaven ' and clean washed face. Well may Mr Birkbeck ' who came from this very spot think the people ' dirty in the western country. I'll engage he ' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one ' family of his present neighbours than he left ' behind upon the skins of all the people in ' the three parishes of Guildford. However he ' would not have found this to be the case in ' Pennsylvania and especially in those parts where ' the Quakers abound ; and I am told that in ' the New England States the people are as ' cleanly and as neat as they are in England. ' The sweetest flowers when they become pu' trid stink the most and a nasty woman is the ' nastiest thing in nature.' In answer to all this our correspondent tells us that the Scotch are very dirty. This we admit was formerly and may still continue in some degree to be the reproach of the Scotch. But does this reasonable person mean to argue from this that dirty habits are amiable and ought not to be corrected. With regard to the difficulties of effecting a settlement we are borne out in our remarks on this subject by the authority of various writers and principally by the autheor of the Emigrant's Guide a work of great merit which combines an extent and precision of statistical information altogether unequally with the most enlarged general views of the state of the country both physical and moral. ' Most men (observes ' this judicious writer) on arriving in the United ' States expects too much. Perhaps the only ' essential advantages offered are the security of ' person and property and the cheapness of land. ' It demands excessive labour severe economy ' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident to ' succeed in a newly settled country ; and it de' mands the permanency of this continued la' bour prudence and favourable circumstances.' Our anonymous correspondent is also extremely displeased that we have stated so strongly the perincious effects produced on the general manners of the Americans by the existence of slavery ; and he mentions that many a labourer in this country might envy the condition of an American slave. What are those privileges for which a free man should envy a slave he does not think proper to state. To show however that we have not exaggerated the degradation and oppression of the coloured class in the United States we shall again adduce the authority of the Emigrant's Guide. The author is contradicting the notion that the labourer in the slave States is confounded with the negroe ; and he expresses himself in the following terms: – ' A residence of 16 years in places where sla' very is prevalent enables us to contradict a ' general expression that in such places whites ' performing manual labour are confounded in ' the moral estimates of the people with slaves. ' Though less respect is certainly paid to useful ' labour in the slave states than where all the ' duties are performed by whites yet ' the distance between the two races of men are ' in all cases immense. So deep profound and ' inveterate is the feeling on that subject that ' not any where in the United States can pro' perty sobriety intelligence and every other ' advantage expect colour raise in public opi' nion a man the most remotely allied to the ' African to a rank equal to the meanest white. ' Any person who resides a few years in Louisi' ana will be witness to some very remarkable ' exemplifications of this innate contempt for all ' those who affinity involve them in the con' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery.' What a picture is here conveyed of misery and degradation on the one hand and of tyranny on the other. – Here we find it failry confessed that no degree of worth whether moral or intel lectual not even the possession of property can give a man the least degree of consideration in the eyes of the privileged class. We cannot conceive a community more wretchedly constituted. All that is estimable and worthy is here utterly contemned because the individual who possesses these qualities happens to have his skin of a particular colour and thus a merely accidental quality of the corporeal frame entails upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy and contempt. These distinctions carried to such an excess seem to us to be founded on the extinction of every generous and honourable sentiment and we cannot help still asserting that we had rather live we at present are than in a community where such hateful antipathies rule to the exclusion of every just and humane feeling. With regard to the condition of the negroe slaves we shall quote a passage from Brown's Western Gazetteer or Emigrant's Directory after reading which we shall leave our anonymous correspondent to say whether he thinks the condition of a labourer in this country preferable to that of being an African slave. The writer describing the town of Lexington in Kentucky observes – ' In this square stands the market-house ' which is of brick and well furnished on Wed' nesdays and Saturdays ; but occasionally the ' scene of a barbarous practise ; for it is here ' that incorrigible or delinquent negroes are ' flogged unmercifully. I saw this punishment ' inflicted on two of these wretches. Their ' screams soon collected a numerous crowd ; I ' could not help saying to myself These cries ' are the knell of Kentucky libery.' Having made this answer to the angry charges thus brought against us we have only to disclaim in the strongest terms all hostility or prejudice against the Americans. We have no wish either to depreciate their character or institutions. They exhibit the interesting spectacle of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace to wealth and greatness. To revile such a people would be the height of human folly and equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to take offence because endeavour to make a fair estimate of their character without hiding any of its defects.  ID137,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,03,29,inform,New colony in Lower Canada The following curious notice is extracted from a Quebec paper:– Interesting to thousands! – Colony of Brotherly Union. It is in agitation to found a colony upon the ancient Spartan plan sanctioned by apostolical usage of living a common and enjoying a community of goods.

To H. Hunt esq. Washington Hotel New Orleans Dec. 25. 1818. My Dear Brother – We arrived safe in the mouth of the Mississippi on the 10th of this month after a voyage of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in excellent health and very happy. There are 35 English vessels from Liverpool now here and a great many English emigrants from Yorkshire Nottinghamshire Lancashire Wiltshire Hampshire and Somersetshire ; and in fact from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a week in the river about 80 miles below New Orleans ; we all went on shore and had plenty of rabbit shooting. I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun by Knock corner of Fetter-lane. Henry myself and Mr Blake went one day into the woods to kill deer by night coming on we lost our road ; and differing in opinions we separated Henry and Mr Blake taking one road and myself the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods and did not return to us till the next morning. It being wet and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground in spite of the remonstrances of Mr Blake caught a severe cold and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days but he is now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In the river there are thousands of wild swans wild geese wild ducks woodcocks snipes and other wild fowl. If you were there you would kill a waggon load in a day as I know you have frequently killed a horse load in England ; but they are a thousand times more numerous here than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms with them and very cheap. No game certificate required here. Myself Henry Mr Blake and the other passengers visited a French farmer about six miles below New Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land whereon are sugar plantations sugar-houses & c. ; he made 250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. – They are very lazy bad managers and appear to use their negroes very cruel and work them very hard. The Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the deaths are frequently seventy in a week. The scenery of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and Staines and many of the buildings are as handsome as those of Bath. Here is one Church which is a very beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spanish shops are all open and it is a market during the whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening gambling & c. We are at the Washington Hotel the best in the city ; it is expensive although very good living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each including claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm weather as in England and it is as warm here now as it was in England in July although not half so oppressive and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the election : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel most of them English. We do not trouble ourselves about politics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday we were charged 100 dollars each for passage and four dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four quarters of the best peas rye grass seed and some more of Hill's Scots ploughs to be left at Messrs Brown and Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the Illinois. Mr Trimmer an Englishman has purchased 20000 acres of land near Mr Birkbeck and has taken twenty couple of hounds with him so that we shall have some hunting as well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought over some with me but they may follow us ; as I understand the labourers with the pay of a dollar a day can live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply and others that I have seen from Illinois report that the farmer can get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is a good sure market and a fair profit and only one penny per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to pay. Price of labour is very dear here ; we pay a dollar for washing every dozen of shirts cravats pocket handkerchiefs & c. & c. The price of a gallon of best rum is one and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things shipped from England I have paid 92 dollars for. Although I should like England very well if it was not for the taxes yet from what I have seen hitherto I like America ten times better  ID187,Glasgow Herald,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1822,01,28,inform,SOUTH AMERICA. Extract of a letter from an Englishman dated Lima September 10 1821. Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colonial town; 6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; the whites are about 1200 Europeans and not as many born in the country; the rest are blacks and mulattoes. Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty and miserty than in any town of the size in the world.– There are some few splendid houses but the rest so disgustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin. The streets as in all American towns run at right angles; a powerful stream of water in each : the town is capable of great improvement. The climate must be bad for the whole population look as if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of Peru we made the same observation; the ague very general with fever–their habits and manner of living increase the evil: thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold –I sleep under a heavy blanket and could bear another; a thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter; the heat however is not excessive during summer; on the whole not an oppressive climate if the people had any idea of living in a rational way. Very few families cook at home–they buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets in pulperias and in the squares: not six families in Lima that have wine on their tables: they drink brandy at all hours and excuse themselves for not having any thing that is expensive by saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies himself a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in the evening. Their money goes in gambling debauchery and dress; every woman high and low has her price; a lady take no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you she is quite as good as her neighbours and needs be no better. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause of all the degradation of South America: every Viceroy from Pizarro to Pezuela was a plunderer a teacher of immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of this people seems incredible–one must see to believe it : scarcely a young lady can read or write or use a needle; few houses that the Devil has not appeared in; and a devout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves : as to priestcraft it reigns here in all its glory : a third part of Lima is covered with churches some of them very splendid. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the single mine of the mountain of Pasco for returns : if this is worked to advantage it will produce six millions of produce. Mining may be carried to any extent it is true; but this requires tranquility and good government. People in Europe have the most erroneous ideas of Peru; every traveller and historian who has written or talked about it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar. Arica the second port of Peru and the great outlet to Upper Peru is a wretched village of hovels covered with mud–about 400 Mulattoes and Indians–placed on a sand bank–the pepole all in the ague–not a boat or ship of any sort. The harbour-master came off on a bulsa (two bladders lashed together) paddled by an Indian. We could not get a basket of fruit or vegetables for money. Their cultivation was three leagues off but they were too lazy to fetch any thing though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to twenty hours offering them any price for their tropical fruits. I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month and sleep on the ground; borrowed a chair and bought some crockery No such thing as a tavern : never was. Letters of no use; no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at eight o'clock to kill time. A play twice a week : the most fashionable ladies stand up in the front boxes and light a segar by the chandlier; the house filled with smoke. There are 82 titled familes mostly idiots–all reduced to poverty by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war be continued a year Peru will be the most wretched country on the globe; indeed the Indians will regain their empire and exterminate all other colours. The number of blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy thousand– 25000 in Lima and adjacent villages; the total population of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians. About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty country houses. Provisions of all sorts excellent and in the greatest variety; fruits of all climates in the marketplace the produce of the sea-shore and the Cordillera.– Beef and mutton excellent–the chief supplies come from Jauja an other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore produce is contiued to little vallies badly cultivated; those about the town would disgrace the free negroes of Carolina. Most valuable land a league from the town half cultivated and half abandoned; every thing left to starved slaves; such famished objects I never behald; no other hands to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general they will not work and famine must ensue.  ID218,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1830,11,10,inform,Messrs Marshall have made a most interesting addition to their beautiful Panorama of Botany Bay Algiers &c. of several Views illustrative of the principal events of the late Revolution in Paris and from the brilliant and effective style in which they are got up must draw the attention of the Public in no ordinary manner.  ID304,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1841,11,17,inform,Wellington New Zealand June 18.– ( From a private letter. )–Among the latest arrivals is Mr Swainson F.R.S. the eminent naturalist by the Jane from London.

Meanwhile the theatre is crowded nightly the public being admitted at second price from the commencement of the performances. Music Hall. –We stated about two month ago that in connection with other improvements in the Assembly Rooms a plan was under consideration for erecting a Music Hall. We are now happy to announce that at a meeting of the proprietors of the Rooms last week full pwers were given to the Directors to take the requisite steps for carrying the design into execution. The desire so long felt by the cultivators of music here will soon be realisd by the erection of a splendid hall constructed with a due regard to the accommodation both of professional men and the public and with a minute attention to the most recent improvements by which full effect is secured to musical performances when conducted on a grand scale. By what may be called a propitious coincidence Mr Bishop the new Professor of Music arrived in Edinburgh on the very day when this resolution was come to. Martin's Paintings. –The exhibition of these celebrated paintings in this city has already we believe attracted many visitors. They are truly wonderful creations and possess a power and grandeur of which the engravings so familiar to the public convey but a faint conception. In contemplating the Deluge the spectator is so [?] [?] [?] the scene that he is apt to overlook the details; but these will be found on inspection to be among the most interesting features of the picture. The groups of perishing beings are exquisitely wrought while everything is made to contribute to the terrific grandeur of the catastrophe. The other two pictures–Pandemonium and the Rivers of Bliss are smaller in size but equally indicative of the high poetic genius of the artist. Nothing could be more striking than the contrast these pictures present to each other–the one fearful beyond expression the other exhibiting a heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the eye rests with delight. There are several other valuable paintings in this collection amongst which is The Offering Up of Isaac a Rembrandt in fine preservation. Gordon's British Diorama. –This beautiful exhibition opened on Saturday last and has we understand been crowded with visitors ever since. It will be seen by Mr Gordon's advertisement in to-day's paper that the view of the Tower of London during the recent conflagration (to which we alluded in our last) has now arrived and is being exhibited along with the other views. Broughton-place Congregation.–We understand that the call given by BroughtonPlace Congregation to the Rev. Mr Croon Sanquhar to be colleague to the Rev. Dr. Brown has not been accepted owing to the strong claims which the affectionate people among whom he presently labours have to continuance of his services and his unfitness as he alleges for a charge so laborious; a result which we learn has caused among the members of Broughton-Place extreme and general regret. Cooke's Equestrian Amphitheatre Leith. –Mr Cooke has generously handed over to the Provost for the benefit of the Destitute Sick Society the handsome sum of t15; being the free proceeds of Friday evening's entertainment which took place under the patronage of the Provost and Magistrates. Captain Ross' Discoveries. –Extracts from Captain Ross' despatches have been published in a Parliamentary paper. From the map which accompanies the paper we gain a more distinct idea of his track than the previous article copied from the Athenean[?] afforded. South Victoria Land which he discovered extends in latitude from 70 1/2 south to 79 how much farther is unknown; and in longitude its eastern coast lies between 163 and 171. Its position is directly south from New Zealand and at the distance of 1500 geographical miles. The length of the part seen was fully 500 miles. It was girt with a border of ice many miles in breadth which rendered it inaccessible. The passage southward was closed at latitude 78 by a barrier of ice 150 feet high which was traced for 300 miles east from Victoria Land. Icebergs were encountered in numbers after they passed parallel of 63 and pack ice at 66. The land rose in lofy peaks from 9000 to 12000 feet in height perfectly covered with eternal snow; the glaciers descended from near the mountain summits project many miles into the ocean and presented a perpendicular face of lofty cliffs. They could not reach the mainland but landed on an island which they found to consist of volcanic rocks. On 28th January in latitude 77 1/2 longitude 169 E. they discovered a magnificent volcano emitting smoke and flame in a splendid profusion and named it Mount Erebus. An extinct one near it was named after the other vessel Mount Terror. At the distance of less than half a mile from the ice cliffs which barred their progress southward they had sound ings with 318 fathoms. These cliffs no doubt reached the bottom and including the 150 feet above water must have had an elevation fo 2000 feet of thereabout. The observations on the dip and declination induced them to place the South Magnetic Pole in latitude 76 and east longitude 153; and they considered its position as well ascertained as if they had reached it though their nearest approach to it was a point 160 miles from it on the east coast of Victoria Land. The pole is probably within that region though this cannot be positively affirmed as its western boundary is unknown. The highest latitude they reached 78. 4. They were therefore only 12 degrees from the pole and about 4 degrees nearer to it than Captain Weddel[?] the most successful of their predecessors. The Non-intrusion Disclosures. –In the Advertiser of yesterday there is a letter from J. M. Hog Esq. of Newliston and another from the Rev. Dr Simpson of Kirknewton both expressing their extreme surprise at the letter of Mr Hamilton (which appeared in our last) and strongly disclaiming all connexion with it on the part of the General Assembly's Committee. Sabbath Observance–The Sweetie Case. –We understand that the Government of Prussia thinking that the mode of keeping the Sabbath in that country was in some respects too lax recently sent over a person to this country to learn whether our practise in Britain would not furnish hints for improvement. Unluckily the very first specimens of our piety which met him were the sweetie case and that of the poor man Key who was excommunicated for burying his child on Sunday. These will of course figure in the very front of the officer's report as the natural fruits of our system and we may guess what their effect will be in reconciling the Germans to a stricter observance of Sunday! We can moreover inform Butters' prosecutors that the fame of their exploits has already travelled by the aid of the Teutonic newspapers to the uttermost parts of Germany to the infinite amusement of the Swabian farmers the Saxon miners and the shepherds of the Riesengeberge. Key's case is no doubt destined to enjoy equal celebrity. Airdrie–Anti-Corn-Law Conference. – On Monday last the members of the United Secession Church Airdrie favourable to a repeal of the Corn and Provision Laws met in compliance with the request of the Committee taking the active management of the Conference to be held in Edinburgh on the second week in January next on that subject when they unanimously appointed their pastor the Rev. Matthew M'Gavin A.M. Mr John Craig Waddell proprietor and Mr James Forrester merchant in Airdrie to represent their sentiments at that meeting which is looked forward to with great interest by the liberal portion of the inhabitants of the burgh. The Rev. Mr Taylor with Messrs Adam Nimmo contractor and John Young bookseller will represent the Independent congregation; and Mr Thomas Muir pastor of the Baptist church will represent that body on that occasion. Kirkcudbright–Address to the Dean of Faculty –We learn that at a meeting held on the 17th current of the Clerks and Procurators of the Steward and COmmissary Courts an address was voted to Alexander Wood Esq. on his appointment to the office of Dean of Faculty and his retirement from that of Steward of Kirkcudbright. Distress in Paisley. –We understand that the Bookbinders of Edinburgh purpose to give a Grand Musical Melange in a few days the proceeds of which are to be handed over to the committee for the distressed weavers in Paisley. Musselburgh. –Mr Wilson Treasurer to the Honest Town has by the hands of the district committeesm collected from the contributors to the Prince of Wales fund nearly t100; and the committees have already distributed 130 tons of coals to the necessitous families in the neighbourhood. Presbytery of Dalkeith–Case of Mr Monroe. –This Presbytery met on Tuesday the 21st current. At a former meeting an agent appeared for Mr Monroe presentee to Fala and laid on the table of Presbytery a presentation in his favour to the parish of Fala. It having been objected that the presentation and some other papers relative thereton bore that Mr Monroe was presented merely to the parish of Fala and not to the united parishes of Fala and Soutra the agent made his appearance again at the meeting which was held on Tuesday with a supplementary presentation and also a letter acceptance from Mr Monroe. The agent when asked admitted that he had not with him a Presbyterial certificate; and he stated that he would not ask the Presbytery to sustain the presentation with relative papers at that meeting. But he intimated that he intended to appear at the next meeting which is appointed to be held on the 22d of February and he expected to be able to show that the Presbytery should then sustain the presentation and relative documents. Splendid Meteor. –On Tuesday evening about eight o'clock a meteor of unusal size and splendour was witnessed in this quarter. The evening was very clear the sky being without a cloud and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly a dazzling blaze of light burst from the sky illuminating Benlomond and the distant hills the Curse around Craigforth and indeed the earth and air on every side as far as the eye could reach with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The phenomenon appeared like a ball of fire of an oblong shape and apparently almost twice the size of the moon having at the time somewhat of the same silvery appearance as that luminary but flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to dazzle the eyes. A tail of fire somewhat resembling that of a rocket but composed of the most beautifully varied colours streamed behind it for a short distance adding much to its spendour and giving the whole an appearance at once singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it disappeared it assumed a red glowing appearance and then burst for an instant enveloping the earth and sky in a blaze as bright and dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared to pass from the south to the north inclining towards the earth. To the eye it seemed to burst and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another meteor of the same kind but much less in size brilliancy and splendour was observed falling in a quartr rather farther to the south a few minutes previously. It is a coincidence worthy of notice that a meteor of the same nature with that first described in the above was seen at the same hour in Glasgow.– Stirly Journal. Glasgow. –The collection made on Sabbath afternoon last by the Rev. Mr Macfarlane's congregation Nicholson Street Glasgow amounted to t46 7s. 6d. This sum is the more praiseworthy when it is considered that this congregation has within a few months subscribed among themselves nearly t1000 for the erection of their beautiful place of worship to be called Erskine Church of which they are erelong to take possession. The Unemployed in Paisley.–The number of unemployed in Paisley has last week decreased by 43. In Kilbarchan and Barrhead they were still on the increase. The following is the official report of yesterday for Paisley and Barrhead :– Paisley. Males 1865 Dependants 4662 –6527 Females 1680 Dependants 3360 –5040 Total 11567 Barrhead. December 17 287 ... 23 346 Increase 59 – Paisley Advertiser. The Paisley Manufacturing Committee. –This Committee continue to carry on their operations with energy and zeal. The amount of the fund now exceeds t8000 and is still on the increase. They have given out about 700 webs already and are as busy as possible preparing more. Unable to get a sufficiency of webs warped in Paisley they have sent for assistance in this respect both to Glasgow and Johnstone. A good deal of work has this week been given to warpers winders and heddle-casters. They have taken much more spacious premises in Gilmour Street in order that they may the more easily supply both town and country weavers. It is desirable that the implement fund should be somewhat enlarged as the other funds of the Committee are not trenched on for that purpose – Ibid. Ducal Generosity.–After the late county meeting at Hamilton at which addresses were voted to the Queen and Prince Albert his Grace the Duke of Hamilton and several of those who had attended the meeting visited the jail. One respectable looking female attracted his Grace's attention; and on inquiry he was told that she was the widow of a respectable wood merchant now deceased and had been confined for upwards of a year at the instance of a law agent in Edinburgh for costs incurred in a suit in the Court of Session. His Grace immediately caused the truth of the poor woman's story to be investigated and on being satisfied of the facts he caused the debt to be paid by his factor and procured the woman's liberation who has thus through his Grace's generosity been restored to liberty and to the superintendence of her young family.– Reformers' Gazette. Presentation. –A number of the members of the United Secession Church Airdrie met in their vestry on the evening of Wednesday the 22d inst. when Councillor Brown in name of the congregation presented the Rev. M. M'Gavin A.M. their pastor with a handsome pulpit gown and cassock as a mark of their respect and esteem; after which a number of the influential members of the congregation entertained him to supper supper in Mr Witherspoon's King's Arms Inn– Mr Daniel Gray collector Coltness Railway in the chair and Dr Clarkson croupier–when the evening was spent in the most friendly happy and intellectual manner. A Rescue.–Last week while the Duke of Hamilton was riding along the wood leading from Hamilton to Bothwell he heard the screams of a female and on looking towards the place whence the cries came he perceived a stout Irishman belabouring a woman in a most unmerciful style. No sooner did he observe this than he rode up to the scene of cruelty dismounted from his horse knocked the savage down rescued the woman and sent her home rejoicing with more money in her pocket than it may have been her lot to possess for a long time. When we recollect that his Grace was born so long ago as October 1767 and so is in his 75th year we cannot sufficiently admire his gallantry humanity and intrepidity– Glasgow Chronicle. Town Council. –The usual meeting of Council did not take place yesterday in consequence of the Christmas holidays. House of Industry. –We understand that Miss Grace Bailie had left a legacy to the Edinburgh House of Industry of ten pounds sterling. Old Church.–The Lords of her Majesty's Treasury have officially intimated to the parties interested their intention to adhere to the original arrangement made with the Town Council for altering the Assembly Aisle and rendering it fit to be permanently used as a place of worship for the accomodation of one of the city congregations. Prince of Wales Fund. –In the table of sums subscribed in the different Wards of Police published in our paper of Saturday last that indicated for the 26th Ward was t120 12s. 9d. Mr Lindores the General Commissioner requests us to state that the sum subscribed in his Ward was t275 12s. 9d. and that the difference between the two sums is the amount of the very handsome subscriptions by the Banks in St Andrew Square and which were drawn by the Treasurer. Presentation of Plate. –On Friday afternoon about fifty citizens entertained Mr William Donaldson of the Albion Cloth Company to an elegant dinner and dessert in the Turf Hotel Princes Street for the purpose of presenting him with a testimonial of their esteem subscribed for by the members of the Celtic Lodge and other private friends. Mr William Wright hat manufacturer was in the chair supported on the right and left by the guest of the evening Mr Pritchard of the Theatre-Royal and other gentlemen. Mr Dick of the Albion officiated as croupier. After the usual loyal and preliminary toasts had been given the chairman called for a bona fide bumper for the toast of the evening and after passing a handomse eulogium on those various qualities of their guest which had endeared him to all his friends neighbours and acquaintances far and wide presented to Mr Donaldson in the name of the subscribers a very elegant and massive silver tea set of the value of t50. Mr Donaldon's health was then proposed and drunk with warm and friendly enthusiasm. The presentee replied to the compliment in modest and appropriate terms. The company spent an exceedingly happy and convivial night; the chairman and croupier taking care that there should be no flagging in the jovialty. The toasts were suitable to the occasion. Mr Mackenzie's instrumental band played appropriate airs to the various toasts and sentiments; and vocal music from amateurs was never wanting; the guest himself being a host in that department. The following inscription is neatly engraved on the various pieces of playe :–To Mr William Donaldson R.W.M. of the Lodge Celtic of Edinburgh and Leith from a number of Masonic and other Friends.–24th Dec. 1841. Theft and Recovery of a Pony. –At a late hour on Sunday night a gentleman residing in the southern part of the town dismounted from his pony at his own gate and proceeding inwards leaving the animal to follow as he was wont to do to the stable. On looking about he observed a young man whom he supposed to be his son take the reins and mount the pony. Shortly afterwards the son came into the house and the question of Where is the pony? soon convinced the parties that it was stolen. They immediately proceeded in search and while the gentleman was giving information at the Police-Office his son discovered the pony with a rider on the North Bridge. He immediately seized the reins and made a clutch at the thief; but the latter very adroitly threw himself off at the opposite side ran down the Fleshmarket stairs and escaped. Providential Recovery. –One day last week a fine little child about five years of age belonging to one of the villagers at Ratho having dandered[?] away with another little play-fellow like himself to a little distance from the house fell into a deep well. His companion was found standing weeping at the edge. The apparently dead body of the little one being got out was taken home and all hopes of its recovery given up when Dr Pringle and excellent young gentleman who is presently assistant of Dr Craig at Ratho made his appearance and by applying himself with indefatiguable perseverance succeeded in recalling the apparently extinguished spark. The next the little romp was as lively as ever. Mungo Park. –A public meeting was held in the town hall of Selkirk on Monday the 26th current the Chief Magistrate in the chair; when various resolutions were adopted with the view of erecting a monument or other permanent mark of respect for the memory of this celebrated traveller. Thimble-Riggers. –A band of thimble-riggers from Edinburgh have for several weeks past been infesting the roads in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. They are six in number and one of them an old man of rather respectable appearance is generally in advance of the party and having got into conversation with a passenger on the road and the others running up and desiring the old man to try his luck; he does so and winning a trifle he easily persuades the person with whom he has been ingratiating himself to try also and he is soon robbed of his whole spare cash. Information having on Wednesday last been given to the Procurator-Fiscal at Pollokshaws and the gang were on the new Kilmarnock Road he immediately despatched two rural police officers in pursuit of them. On the officers coming up to the gang they separated and ran off but the officers captured two of them (the old man and another) who were safely lodged in Pollokshaws Jail; and having been brought before two of the Justices and several person having sworn to being defrauded by them of their money they were sentenced tothirty days' imprisonment in Paisley House of Correction with hard labour as rogues and vagabonds; and an active look-out is made by the police for the remainder of the gang. Stoppage of Payments by the Town of Paisley. –Partly on account of the great depression of trade and partly on account of a run raised by the circulation of malicious and false statements regarding the affairs of the community of Paisley theTown Council at a meeting on Wednesday evening ordered the Chamberlain to susspend receipt or payment of deposits in the meantime but to proceed with all possible despatch in realizing the outstanding debts due to the community for the regular payment of the interest on the money borrowed and other current engagements of the burgh. It is pretty generally known that a small portion of the would-be-political leaders of the town who have not the influence to get themselves placed in municipal authority have for a good number of years endeavoured to embarass the party in power by attacking the credit of the community. The unfavourabout state of trade and the leniency of the Council in not enforcing during the last year the exactions on the owners of property for entries &c. falling due caused a deficiency of nearly t300 in the usual amount of revenue. This simple circumstance was taken advantage of though nothing was lost thereby and statements prejudicial to the town's credit were placed in the hands of every credito that could be found by the individuals referred to and thus uncalled for alarm raised. In addition to this the adherents of the same party in the Council during the last five days gave currency to another statement which they knew to be quite untrue about the late Provost having commenced to secure himself by drawing a thousand pounds when the fact was he had not drawn out a penny. From the position to which which the affiars the town are now driven a full and public exposure of these matters will soon be submitted to the creditors. The Council have been negotiating for such a loan of money as will pay off those who are dissatisfied which in the ordinary state of the money market they would long since have obtained though at present that is difficult. As regards risk to the creditors from the best informed quarters we are assured there is none. More than one-third of the whole debts of the town are due to the Bank and the members of Council or their immediate friends and fully a half of the debt against the river is due to the same parties. This we should conceive the strongest proof that could be adduced of the confidence of those who should best know the state of the town's affairs.– Glasgow Chronicle. Disgraceful Trick.–At a late wake in the country a short way from Crieff a waggish fellow tied a cord secretly to the neck of the corpse and while a number of young men and women present were going on merrily with some sport the wag pulled the cord when corpse started up in the bed making the clothes to fly off; the whole party rushed to the door crying for mercy upon them and knocking each other over in the hurry when at length some people came to their assistance who afterwards discovered the cause of their terror.– Perth Courier. The Church Question. –Long ago Dr Chalmers let out the secret of the clerical movement by declaring that very little of Non-intrustion would satisfy him and his friends provided the independent power of the Church were secured. Now this liberum arbitrium does nothing at all for Non-intrusion; but it does a great deal for Church Independence. It confers no privilege on the laity; but it adds immeasurably to the power of the clergy. It is in fact the very worst part of the claims that have been advanced by the Church; and its effects would simply be to sacrifice the lay Non-intrusionists on the one hand and clerical Moderates on the other. It means literally uncontrolled power to the Church The General Steam Navigation Company's ship Monarch Captain Fraser arrived at Granton from London on Monday evening at half-past nine o'clock. Election of a Minister for Old Monk- land. –The election of a minster took place at Old Monkland Church on Thursday the 23d inst. and the right of patronage being vested in the Heritors and Kirk-Session the election might be considered a popular one. About 150 voters attended the meeting and a decided wish having been expressed by it is understood the whole of the heritors that no candidate known to be connected with the Non-intrusion party in the Church should be chosen the meeting acting upon this principle unanimously agreed to elect the Rev. Mr Johnston Greenock as minister of the parish. Considering the number of voters the unanimity that prevailed among the electors it is believed is without precedent and stongly marks the sentiments and feelings of a large and very populous parish on the present proceedings of the dominant party in th Church. Mr Johnston was proposed by General Pye Douglass of Rosehall seconded by Mr M'Caul of Daldowie and unanimously elected.– Reformers' Gazette. Destructive Fire. –About three o'clock on the morning of the 25th curt. an alarm of fire was given at Balmangan Mill in the parish of Rerwick. The premises are occupied by Mr Kissock and despite the great exertions of himself servants and neighbours the work of destruction proceeded with a degree of rapidity that rendered it impossible to save a single article. The flames in their fury having charred the rafters the roof fell in with a loud crash; and before long the entire mill with the exception of the side walls became an unbroken mass of ruins. The building contained a considerable quantity of grain and oatmeal the property of the tacksman all of which was unforunately destroyed. As the premises were found quite safe a very few hours previously suspicion of incendiarism have naturally arisen but no clue thus far has been found attaching guilt to a single individual. The fire if wilful implies the blackest malice and it is sad to think that any one could have been so wicked as to destroy what thousands are in want of and would gladly toil for if they only knew how–daily bread– Dumfries Courier. Hamilton. –Some influential persons in Hamilton and the neighbourhood have subscribed to build an Episcopal chapel in that town. We have been informed that all the requisite arrangements have been made for carrying the views of the subscribers into effect. This is one effect of the conduct of the rebellious majority of the General Assembly. Many of thsoe now friendly to the scheme never dreamed of espousing Episcopacy till they have been driven in disgust from the Church of their fathers by the conduct of their ministers; men who exist in their offices by law and yet set that very law at defiance in virtue of which they hold offices and draw their temporalities as they cantingly term their good things which alone induce some of them at least to remain members of the venerable Establishment. Who would have believed some years ago that Black Prelacy was about to be established within sight of Bothwell Brigg!  ID340,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,06,21,inform,The brig Virginia Planter James Merrifield Master arrived at Liverpool brings information that on the 5th of May General Wayne with two thousand provincials had attacked totally destroyed most of the Indian towns at the back of Georgia for near two hundred miles around the river. That M'Gilvray and his army of savages after an unsuccessful and bloody engagement had fled to the woods where the General left them and returned to Savannah.– This expedition was undertaken about the beginning of March winch has been crowned with the expected catastrophe and though the Cherokee Miami and Chiquesaw tribes may mediate revenge at some future period; it is not likely they will be in a condition to disturb the settlers for some years to come.  ID367,Glasgow Herald,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1822,01,28,inform,Extract of a letter from an Englishman dated Lima Septemper 10 1821 Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colonial town; 6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; the whites are about 1200 Europeans and not as many born in the country; the rest are blacks and mulattoes. Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty and misery than in any town of the size in the world.– There are some few splendid houses but the rest so disgustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin. The streets as in all American towns run at right angles; a powerful stream of water in each; the town is capable of great improvement. The climate must be bad for the whole population look as if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of Peru we made the same observation; the ague very general with fever–their habits and manner of living increase the evil; thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold –I sleep under a heavy blanket and could bear another; a thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter; the heat however is not excessive during summer; on the whole not an oppressive climate if the people had any idea of living in a rational way. Very few families cook at home℃they buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets in pulperias and in the squares; not six families in Lima that have wine on their tables; they drink brandy at all hours and excuse themselves for not having any thing that is expensive by saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies himself a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in the evening. Their money goes in gambling debauchery and dress; every woman high and low has her price; a lady takes no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you she is quite at good as her neighbours and needs be no better. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause of all the degradation of South America; every Viceroy from Pizarro to Pezuela was a plunderer a teacher of immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of this people seems incredible–one must see to believe it; scarcely a young lady can read or write or use a needle; few houses that the Devil has not appeared in; and a devout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves; as to priestcraft it reigns here in all its glory; a third part of Lima is covered with churches some of them very splendid. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the single mine of the mountain of Pasco for returns; if this is worked to advantage it will produce six millions of dollars; but if the country is disturbed by war not a dollar will they have. The exports of Peru in ordinary times were five millions of dollars in pecie and one million in produce. Mininng may be carried to any extent it is true; but this requires tranquillity and good government. People in Europe have the most erroneous ideas or Peru; every traveller and historian who has written or talked about it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar. Arica the second port of Peru and the great outlet to Upper Peru is a wretched village of hovels covered with mud–about 400 Mulattoes and Indians–placed on a sand bank–the people all in the ague–not a boat or ship of any sort. The harbour-master came off on bulsa (two bladders lashed together) paddled by an Indian. We could not get a basket of fruit or vegetablse for money. Their cultuvation was three leagues off but they were too lazy to fetch any thing though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to twnety hours offering them any price for their tropical fruits. I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month and sleep on the ground; borrowed a chair and bought some crockery. No such thing as a tavern; never was. Letters of no use; no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at eight o'clock to kill time. A play twice a week; the most fashionable ladies stand up in the front boxes and light a segar by the chandelier; the house filled with smoke. There are 82 titled families mostly idiots–all reduced to poverty by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war be continued a year Peru will be the most wretched country on the globe; indeed the Indians will regain their empire and exterminate all other colours. the number of blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy thousand– 25000 in Lima and adjacent village the total population of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians. About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty country houses. Provisions of all sorts excellent and in the greatest variety; fruits of all climates in the marketplace the produce of the sea-shore and the Cordillera.– Beef and mutton excellent–the chief supplies come from Janja and other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore produce is continued to little vallies badly cultivated; those about the town would disgrace the free negroes of Carolina. Most valuable land a league from the town half cultivated and half abandoned; every thing left to starved slaves; such famished objects I never beheld; no other hands to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general they will not work and famine must ensue.  ID368,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,07,25,advertise,LANDS in AMERICA for SALE. THESE two adjoining TRACKS of LAND in the County of FAYETTE and State of KENTUCKY. The one track consists of 7000 acres and is divided into 15 plantations of 500 acres each; eight of these plantations are still unsold and are now offered at the low price of 137l. being only 5s. 6d. per acre. The other track counsists of 3086 acres and is to be sold in one lot at 5s. 6d. per acre. There is a fine stream of water running through these two tracks of land which communicates with the great river Ohio so that Mills may be erect. In Fayette County is Lexington where the Courts of the State of Kentucky are held and where all public business is transacted Lexington is in the neighbourhood of these lands and Fayette county is the nearest and most convenient for Philadelphia Baltimore City of Washington &c. The soil of Kentucky is deep and black and lies upon a bed of lime-stone and coal. THe natural grown of the country are large walnuts honey poplar and sugar trees. The surface is covered with blue grass clover and wild rye grape vines running to the tops of the trees. Shrubs and plants grow spontaneously and afford a beautiful blossom of a rich and exquisite fragrance. Cotton and sugar are manufactured to advantage. wheat barley oats flax and hemp yield abundantly; indeed it is assumed that there have been raised 100 bushels upon one acre but the common produce is from 40 to 60 bushels an acre. Owing to the peculiar richness of the soil and fine climate of the country no part of America has been to repidly settled. The returns made to Congress upon 1st May 1792 state them at 76 000. In March 1793 there were upwards of 100000. And from their astonishing increase since they may be estimated at 200000. Eleven years ago Kentucky lay in a forest but now she exhibits an extensive settlement divided into seven populous counties in which are a great number of flourishing towns and contains more inhabitants than are in Georgia Delaware and Rhode Island States. There are about 70 churches in Kentucky and mostly PResbyterians. There is a College; and Schools are established in every town. There is a Printing-office; a Weekly Gazette published. There are Paper Mills O??? Mills???ing Mills Saw Mills and a great number of Grist Mills. Considerable quantities of Sugar are made from the Sugar Trees. Salt-works are in every part of the country and the inhabitants are supplied at a low price. The taxes upon land are very low. Any person who goes from Europe becomes an American Citizen on his arrival in this new State and is entitled to be elected to any office in the Commonwealth. For farther particulars apply to MR. John Granger writer to the signet; David Niven writer Glasgow; or to Mr. John Finlayson writer Cupar Fife;  ID372,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,01,06,inform,The following new cities independent of innumerable small towns have been lately begun to be built in America. The city of Washington which in the year 1800 is to be the capital of the United States; the city of Paterson in the State of New Jersey; the city of Hudson upon the North River in the state of New York; the city of Columbia which is now the capital of the State of South Carolina; the city of Martenberg now the capital of North Carolina; the city of Knoxcille in teh new district of Franklyn; the city of Nuskville in the new district of Cumberland; the city of Lexington and the city of Donxville in the new State of Kentucky; and the city of Bennington in the new state of Vermont.
