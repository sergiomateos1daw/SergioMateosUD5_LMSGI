Walker from Liverpool. They are dated the 16th November and contain an account of the arrival of several ships from Newfoundland and some from Halifax; that provisions of all kinds were very plentiful and reasonable.  ID4,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,13,inform,Our latest accounts from the West Indies say that no supply from the islands either of wheat or flour can possibly be obtained from the American states in consequence of the great bounties given by his Most Christian Majesty on these articles. Our charity therefore if we have any of these articles to spare must be first extended to our own Colonies ; and we cannot be surprised particularly when we consider the present price of bread at home that no assistance can be given at present either to the French or Dutch. The crops in the island of Jamaica promise a most plentiful harvest except to the eastward which ahs generally been considered as the most productive part. By the Westmoreland just arrived from Jamaica we learn that the slaves have become mutinous to an alarming degree ever since they were made acquainted with the intended abolition of the Slave Trade.  ID5,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,20,inform,Extract of a letter from Quebec June 6. We are dreadfully alarmed at present on account of the great scarcity of flour throughout the province. Common flour sold this morning in the market at six dollars per cwt. bran from 7s. 6d. to 6s. oats 3s. per bushel and pease 20d. per bushel. There has been an account taken of the quantity of flour and wheat in this city and liberties by order of the Governor and Council and we find there is not more than will serve as ten days. They ar much worse off in the district of Montreal than we are here: We have sent them frequent supplies. Wheat which was found too bad to be shipped last year at three livres now sells at two dollars. One Merchant will make upwards of fifteen hundred pounds by this job. Government for the relief of the poor have caused to be issued by the contractor here rise at 3 d. per lb. no one to get more than a dollar's worth at a time. The day before yesterday there was delivered above a hundred pounds worth in this way. In consequence of letters by last Thursday's post from Montreal two thousand bushels of damaged wheat were shipped yesterday for that market. We have not had a grain of flour from England or the States though we hear of a cargo from New York for Montreal. The vessel was to call at New Brunswick ; and it is more than probably that people there being in great want themselves have detained her. The Government have done now what they should have done five or six months ago and then we should not be in this starving condition ; that is we are to have a proclamation to permit the importation of grain and flour from the States. My servant is just come home from the baker's where I had sent him for half a dollar's worth of bread. After watching for two hours till the bread came out of the overn he could get but eighteen-pennyworth ; three small loaves indeed weighing only two pounds each. Thirty-five shillings have been paid for ship biscuit. The Lord knows what will become of us–except Government will distribute some of the flour that is come for the troops in the Queen. Mr. Davidson one of the Council assured us on Thursday last there was not wheat and flour in the country for five weeks. He has taken a great deal of pains to be well informed on the subjuct; and to him are we indebted for the proclamation to allow the importation from the States. He stood forth alone and offered at his own expence to get an account taken of the quantities of wheat and flour in the town and liberties of Quebec and insisted on its being taken into consideration.  ID7,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,20,inform,Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Bermuda to his friend in Norfolk Virginia dated April 2. By Captain Gilbert the bearer of this you will learn our distress for want of provi - sions: There has not been in the whole island one bushel of corn for sale for 16 days past. Capt. George from Baltimore brought in ???days ago two bushels of corn which sold immeddiately at 6s. 8d. per bushel; he also brought in 360 barrels of flour common and superfine which sold at eight and nine dollars per barrel. No vessel has arrived here with provisions since Capt. George; and no vessel belonging to the island is expected to relieve us. A great number of poor people have been for ten days past obliged to live on the greens of the field. Governor Hamilton by advice of his counsel has opened the port of Bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever for thirty days to be computed from the 30th day of March laden with bread corn; or flour. He also allows for three months the importation of salted provisions from any foreign port whatever in vessels belonging to these islands. IT is said what if any foreign vessel should come here after the time permited by proclamation they will be allowed to dispose of their cargo if they can prove they set out with an intent to come here. If any vessels be ready to sail from Norfolk with provisions advise them to call at Bermuda.  ID18,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,09,21,persuade,A short DESCRIPTION of and REMARKS upon a new State called THE WESTERN TERRITORY being one of four settled by the Americans since 1774. T HAT no nation can serve the Americans with goods equal in quality and price to Britain is wha the whole world knows and from experience the most obstinate rebel American dare not deny: It is with pleasure therefore we inform our readers that the United States are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures–They have already laid out four new States since the beginning of their rebellion viz. Vermont Kentucky Indiana and The Western Territory. About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky ten years ago lay in forest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has been the population that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants already in each of these states. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year in 1789 and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States published in America in May last we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them called The Western Territory ; and it must rerejoice the heart of every Briton to read it and think that the settling of these countries though the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 20 years will long keep them from manufacturing and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman even though wages are very high when he can for twenty pounds purchase a thousand acres of land that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect that new channels of commerce will be opened and the inland parts of the Continent will require an increasing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation will be diffused through a country more fertile more extensive than all the Thirteen United States. The Western Territory Is the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river –north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania? south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains according to Mr. Hutchins Geographer General to the Congress 411000 square miles equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres from which he deducts forth-three millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hundred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the fed–ral government which is to be sold for the discharge of the debt owing to the United States. But a very small proportion of these lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*. On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements are already commenced–one at Marietta the other at Miami. This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787 and already contains above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi Ohio Muskingham Hockhocking Sioto Miami Wobash&c–Coal and iron mines and salt pits abound in this State; the soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy pleasant and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States. The timber is tall and in great variety?Streams for mills abound here. Wheat indigo hemp and cotton thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties and fulfill the description of travellers who call it the garden of the world. It is here probably also that the center of a great empire will be fixed in some future period. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accommodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with wild game of every kind; herds of deers elks bears &c fill the extensive meadows of thie country?turkies geese swans and partridges &c. are innumerable. The rivers are excellently stored with fish and almost all navigable for small sloops. In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30000 persons; and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States. Rejoice O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you and you only! * No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum.  ID22,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,10,09,inform,Philadelphia Aug. 5. We are happy in informing our readers that in the memory of the oldest man among us a more plentiful year has not been known than the present. Neither mildew nor fly has affected the wheat; the grain is heavy and full and in large quantities. The other grains are likewise plentiful and of an excellent quality. Such distinguished favours call for the gratitude of the inhabitants of the United Sates to the great Author of Nature; especially when these blessings of nature are connected in the same year with deliverance from anarchy and with the establishment of a wise free and just government.  ID33,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,11,inform,Extract of a letter from a gentleman in America to his friend in Greenock . No doubt Sir you have been expecting this some time a remittance in money for your goods; but as part of them is still on hand I could not properly answer you in cash or bills ; however if you will accept of wheat in return it shall be immediately sent you ; for our wheat crop has been so plentiful that we can supply you with many thousand bolls of an eceeding fine quality ; and to my knowledge there are several ships loading for your market at present.  ID34,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,11,inform,The American Congress having declared it to be the interest of the United States to encourage agriculture by the cultivation of large plantations and to purchase their merchandize from Europe have in consequence considerably lowered the duties on such merchandize. They have also resolved to sell four or five millions of acres of land instead of two millions which they sold annually in the States; the produce of which will son suffice to prevent the necessity of circulating paper money any longer.  ID36,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,14,inform,Orders are sent to Plymouth for the Echo sloop of war Capt. Drew lately arrived from Newfoundland and now lying in the Sound to get ready for sea and proceed with all possible dispatch to New York–to acquaint the American Merchants that the British ports are open for the importation of American wheat :–It is to be hoped this salutary measure will reduce the present high price of wheat and flour.  ID44,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,inform,Advices from Baltimore in Maryland say that all the wheat and flour that could be purchased was actually contracted for throughout that fertile province on the 10th of October last for the French market and it was thought the same man–uvre had taken place at New York Philadelphia and Rhode Island.  ID51,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,25,inform,By letters from America dated the 5th ult. we learn that wheat is so great a crop all over the Provinces that it has fallen at Virginia to [?] a bushel. At Philadelphia it is 7s. 6d. paper currency about 3s. 8d. Sterling per bushel;–which has reduced the price in France in from 48s. to 42s. 2d. and it is 20s. per quarter lower in Holland than it was four months ago. Two ships laden with American wheat have already arrived at Bristol where the cargoes were immediately purchased by the dealers. Large orders are sent to America for wheat of which there has been a prodigious crop.  ID52,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,25,inform,The Americans have refused every kind of supply of grain to the French without the ready money. M. de Mirabeau's scheme of receiving the debt of the United States due to France proves an abortion.  ID55,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,07,inform,In consequence of the order of the Privy council the merchants of Bristol have sent large orders to America for wheat where the crop has been the greatest ever known.  ID71,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,10,04,inform,Extract of a letter from New York Aug. 3. Our harvest is over westward and through the southern counties of this State. This week will finish it in the northern and I am confident we have not had so fine a crop since 1774 and all gathered without a drop of rain which will render wheat fit for exportation in OCtober. The Summer grains are also abundant and those on the ground especially Indian corn equally promising. Should Europe require wheat at even two thirds of the prices given last year we shall draw a very large balance from them in specie. The public debt of this country having in course of a few days been funded brought many foreigners into deep speculations which reduced bills of exchange to par.  ID78,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,26,inform,By letters from the New York Packet dated October 6 from Philadelphia we learn that there has been a very fine harvest in the Southern States and that the wheat has been wonderfully productive. A very large quantity had been bought up for the Spanish markets. The quality of European goods imported the last season was immense goods selling for considerable loss ; and such will always be the case when the Merchants in England anticipate a ray of fruitfulness of the American Soil.–The appearance of a Spanish war had given them great prospects of commercial advantages and a seven years war is what the Americans were all earnestly wishing for.  ID102,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1802,07,01,inform,New South Wales The following particulars respecting this flourishing colony will not be unacceptable to our readers :– We are informed by Lieutenant Grant who is lately arrived from New South Wales of the flourishing state of that colony ; he left Port Jackson in November last when the crops were very luxuriant and beginning to be cut down without having suffered that year from the floods. Governor King had opened a communication with Otaheite for the purpose of supplying the colony with pork in which he had been singularly successful his Majesty's armed ship Porpoise having made one trip and the Norfolk brig having sailed on the same employ previous to Mr Grant's leaving Sydney. The most friendly understanding exists between the natives of Otaheite and the settlement of New South Wales. We are happy to hear that the latter country is longer in want of a staple commodity the article of coals of an excellent kind being found in abundance in Hunter's River together with plenty of wood well qualified for the masting of shipping. Mr Grant made his passage to the Cape of Good Hope round Cape Horn in the brig Anna Josepha loaded with spars for masts and coals which latter sold immediately at the Cape at 36 rix dollars per ton (nearly 6l. sterling.) Governor King had formed a small settlement at Hunter's River for the purpose of working the coal which is of the same nature with that of Newcastle. Mr Grant entered this river in the Lady Nelson in order to obtain the survey of it. He penetrated in his boats nearly seventy miles up the same accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Paterson without being able at that time to discover its source. A wood resemblingsustic had also been found. Mr Grant in his passage from England to Port Jackson in the Lady Nelson a vessel of only 60 tons burthen with three sliding keels and built on Captain Schank's construction was the first that passed through the straits which separate Van Diemens Land from New Holland and sailed along a great extent of coast to the westward of any land before seen by those who had visited that country going into no higher latitude than 39. 30. fourth ; and observes that the fourth cape of New Holland lies in 39. 2. fourth. He found those he sailed along bold with very deep water wherever he attempted to land ; and in general he had with a very moderate offing from 50 10 45 and 30 fathoms water fine land and sometimes shells. By order of Governor King he returned into those straits and obtained the survey of the coast from Wilson's Promontory to Western Port with the survey of that harbour which is well sheltered and capable of containing many sail of shipping. There is abundance of wood easily to be got and plenty of water ; though the latter is rather difficult to be procured on account of the distance and from several shoals lying in the way which render it necessary to take advantage of tide. Mr Grant gives a very favourable report of that part of the country.  ID117,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1816,01,15,inform,New South Wales A journey into the interior of New South Wales across the Blue Mountains performed by his Excellency Colonel Mac quarrie Governor of the settlement. From the official account dated Sydney June 10. 1815. The Governor desires to communicate for the information of the public the result of his late tour over the Western or Blue Mountains undertaken for the purpose of being enabled personally to appreciate the importance of the track of country lying westward of them which had been explored in the latter end of the year 1813 and beginning of 1814 by Mr George William Evans Deputy Surveyor of Lands. To those who know how very limited a track of country has been hitherto occupied by the colonists of New South Walves extending along the eastern coast to the north and south of Port Jackson only 80 miles and westward about 40 miles to the foot of that chain of mountains in the interior which forms its western boundary it must be a subject of astonishment and regret that amongst so large a population no one appeared within the first twenty-five years of the establishment of this settlement possessed of sufficient energy of mind to induce him fully to explore a passage over these mountains ; but when it is considered that for the greater part of that time even this circumscribed portion of country afforded sufficient produce for the wants of the people whilst on the other hand the whole surface of the country beyond those limits was a thick and in many places nearly an impenetrable forest the surprise at the want of effort to surmount such difficulties must abate very considerably. The records of the colony only afford two instances of any bold attempt having been made to discover the country to the westward of the Blue Mountains. The first was by Mr Bass and the other by Mr Caley and both ended in disappointment; a cirumstance which will not be much wondered at by those who have lately crossed these mountains. To Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth Esqrs. and Liutenant Lawson of the Royal veteran company the merit is due of having with extraordinary patience and much fatigu effected the first passage over the most rugged and difficult part of the Blue Mountains. The Governor being strongly impressed with the importance of the object had early after his arrival in this colony formed the resolution of encouraging the attempt to find a passage to the western country and willingly availed himself of the facilities which the discoveries of these three gentlemen afforded him. Accordingly on the 20th of November 1813 he entrusted the accomplishment of this object to Mr George William Evans deputy surveyor of lands the result of whose journey was laid before the public through the medium of the Sydney Gazette on the 12th of February 1814. The favourable account given by Mr Evans of the country he had explored induced the Governor to cause a road to be constructed for the passage and conveyance of cattle and provisions to the interior ; and men of good character from amongst a number of convicts who had volunteered their services were selected to perform this arduous work on condition of being fed and clothed during the continuance of their labour and being granted emancipations as their final reward on the completion of the work. The direction and superintendence of this great work was entrusted to William Cox. Esq. the chief magistrate at Windsor ; and to the astonishment of every one who knows what was to be encountered and sees what has been done he effected its completion in six months from the time of its commencement happily without the loss of a man or any serious accident. The Governor is at a loss to appreciate fully the services rendered by Mr Cox to this colony in the execution of this arduous work which promises to be of the greatest public utility by opening a new source of wealth to the industrious and enterprising. When it is considered that Mr Cox voluntarily relinquished the comforts of his own house and the society of his numerous family and exposed himself to much personal fatigue with only such temporary covering as the bark hut could afford from the inclemency of the season it is difficult to express the sentiments of approbation to which such privations and services are entitled. Mr Cox having reported the road as completed on the 21st of January the Governor accompanied by Mrs Macquarrie and that gentleman commenced his tour on the 25th of April last over the Blue Mountains and was joined by Sir John Jamieson at the Nepean who accompanied him during the entire tour. The following gentlemen composed the Governor's suite: Mr Campbell Secretary ; Captain Antill Major of Brigade ; Lieutenant Watts Aide decamp ; Mr Redfern Assistant-Surgeon ; Mr Oxley Surveyor-General ; Mr Mehan Deputy Surveyor-General ; Mr Lewin Painter and Naturalist ; and Mr G. Evans Deputy Surveyor of lands who had been sent forward for the purpose of making further discoveries and rejoined the party on the day of arrival at Bathurst Plains. The commencement of the ascent from Emu Plains to the first depot and thence to a resting place now called Spring Wood distant twelve miles from Emu Ford was through a very handsome open forests of lofty trees and much more practicable and easy than was expected. The facility of the ascent for this distance excited surprise and is certainly not well calculated to give the traveller a just idea of the difficulties he has afterwards to encounter. At a further disstance of four miles a sudden change is perceived in the appearance of the timber and the quality of the soil the former becoming stunted and the latter barren and rocky. At this place the fatigues of the journey may be said to commence. Here the country became altogether mountainous and extremely rugged. Near to the 18th mile (it is to be observed that the measure commences at Emu Ford) a pile of stones attracted attention. It is close to the line of road on the top of a rugged and abrupt ascent and is supposed to have been placed there by Mr Caley as the extreme limit of his tour. Hence the Governor gave that part of the mountain the name as Caley's[?] Repulse. To have penetrated even so far was at that time an effort of no small difficulty. From henceforward to the 26th mile is a succession of steep and rugged hills some of which are almost so abrupt as to deny a passage altogether ; but at this place a considerable extensive plain is arrived at which constitutes the summit of the western mountains ; and from thence a most extensive and beautiful prospect presents itself on all sides to the eye. The town of Windsor the river Hawkesbury Prospect Hill and other objects within that part of the colony now inhabited of equal interest are distinctly seen from hence. The majestic grandeur of the situation combined with the various objects to be seen from this place induced the Governor to give it the appellation of the King's Table Land. On the south-west side of the King's Table Land the mountain terminates in abrupt precipices of immense depth at the bottom of which is seen a glen as romantically beautiful as can be imagined bounded on the further side by mountains of great magnitude terminating equally abruptly as the others and the whole thickly covered with wood. The length of this picturesque and remarkable track of country is about 24 miles to which the Governor gave the name of the Prince Regent's Glen. Proceeding hence to the thirty-third mile on the top of a hill an opening presents itself on the south-west side of the Prince Regent's Glen from whence a view is obtained particularly beautiful and grand–mountains rising beyond mountains with stupendous masses of rock in the fore ground here strike the eye with admiration and astonishment. The circular form in which the whole is so wonderfully disposed induced the Governor to give the name of Pitt's Amphitheatre (in honour of the Right Hon. William Pitt) to this offset of branch from the Prince Regent's Glen. The road continues from hence for the space of 17 miles on the ridge of the mountain which forms one side of the Prince Regent's Glen and there it suddenly terminates in nearly a perpendicular precipice of 676 feet high as ascertained by measurement. The road constructed by Mr Cox down this rugged and tremendous descent through all its windings is no less than three-fourths of a mile in length and has been executed with such skill and stability as reflects much credit on him. The labour here undergone and the difficulties surmounted can only be appreciated by those who view this scene. In order to perpetuate the memory of Mr Cox's services the Governor deemed it a tribute justly due to him to give his name to this grand and extraordinary pass and he accordingly called it Cox's Pass. Having descended into a valley at the bottom of this pass the retrospective view of the overhanging mountain is magnificently grand. Although the present pass is the only practicable point yet discovered for descending by yet the mountain is much higher than those on either side of it from whence it is distinguished at a considerable distance when approaching it from the interior and in this point of view it has the appearance of a very high distinct hill although it is in fact only the abrupt termination of a ridge. The Governor gave the name of Mount York to this termination of the ridge in honour of his Royal Highness the Duke of York. On descending Cox' Pass the Governor was much gratified by the appearance of good pasture land and soil fit for cultivation which was the first he had met with since the commencement of his tour. The valley at the base of Mount York he called the Vale of Clwyd in consequence of the strong resemblance it bore to the vale of that name in North Wales. The grass in this vale is of a good quality and very [?]dant and a rivulet of fine water runs along it from the eastward which unites itself at the western extremity of the vale with another rivulet containing still more water. The junction of these two streams forms a very handsome river now called by the Governor Cox's River which takes its course as has been since ascertained through the Prince Regent's Glen and empties itself into the river Nepean ; and it is conjectured from the nature of the country through which it passes that it mut be one of the principal causes of the floods which have been occasionally felt on the low banks of the river Hawkesbury into which the Nepean discharges itself. The Vale of Clwyd from the base of Mount York extends six miles in a westerly direction and has its termination at Cox's River. Westward of this river the country again becomes hilly but it is generally open forest land and very good passage. Three miles to the westward of the Vale of Clwyd Messrs Blaxland Wentworth and Lawson had formerly terminated their excursion ; and when the various difficulties are considered which they had to contend with especially until they had effected the descent from Mount York to which place they were obliged to pass through a thick brush-wood where they were under the necessity of cutting a passage for their baggage horses the severity of which labour had seriously affected their healths their patient endurance of such fatigue cannot fail to excite much surprise and admiration. In commemoration of their merits three beautiful high hills joining each other at the end of their tour at this place have receieved their names in the following order viz. Mount Blaxland Wentworth's Sugar Loaf and Lawson's Sugar Load. A range of very lofty hills and narrow vallies alternately form the track of country from Cox's River for a distance of 16 miles until the Fish River is arrived at ; and the stage between these rivers is consequently very severe and oppressive on the cattle. To this range the Governor gave the name of Clarence Hilly Range. Proceeding from the Fish River and at a short distance from it a very singular and beautiful mountain attracts the attentions its summit being crowned with a large and very extraordinary looking rock nearly circular in form which gives the whole very much the appearance of a hill fort such as are frequent in India. To this lofty hill Mr Evans who was the first European discoverer gave the name of Mount Evans. Passing on from hence the country continues hilly but affords good pasturage gradually improving to Sidmouth Valley which is distant from the pass of the Fish RIver eight miles. The land here is level and the first met with unencumbered with timber. It is not of very considerable extent but abounds with a great variety of herbs and plants such as would probably highly interest and gratify the scientific botanist. The beautiful little valley runs northwest and south-east between hills of easy ascent thinly covered with timber. Leaving Sidmouth Valley the country becomes again hilly and in other respects resembles very much the country to the eastward of the valley for some miles. Having reached Campbell River distant 13 miles from Sidmouth Valley the Governor was highly gratified by the appearance of the country which there began to exhibity an open and extensive view of gently rising grounds and fertile plains. Judging from the height of the banks and its general width the Campbell River must be on some occasions of very considerable magnitude ; but the extraordinary drought which has apparently prevailed on the western side of the mountains equally as throughout this colony for the last three years has reduced this river so much that it may be more properly called a chain of pools than a running stream at the present time. In the reaches or pools of the Campbell River the very curious animal called the Paradox or Water Mole is seen in great numbers. The soil on both banks is uncommonly rich and the grass is consequently luxuriant. Two miles to the southward of the line of road which crosses the Campbell River there is a very fine rich track of low lands which has been named Mitchell Plains. Flax was found here growing in considerable quanities. The Fish River which forms a junction with the Campbell River a few miles to the northward of the road and bridge over the latter has also two very fertile plains on its banks the one called O'Connel Plains and the other Macquarrie Plains both of considerable extent and very capable of yielding all the necessities of life. At the distance of seven miles from the bridge over the Campbell River Bathurst Plains open to the view presenting a rich track of champaign country of 11 miles in length bounded on both sides by gently rising and very beautiful hills thinly wooded. The Macquarrie River which is constituted by the junction of the Fish and Campbell River takes a winding course through the Plains which can be easily traced from the high lands ajoining by the particular verdure of the trees on its banks which are likewise the only trees throughout the extent of the plains. The level and clean surface of these plains gives them at first view very much the appearance of lands in a state of cultivation. It is impossible to behold this grand scene without a feeling of admiration and surprise whilst the silence and solitude which reign in a space of such extent and beauty as seems designed by Nature for the occupancy and comfort of man created a degree of melancholy in the mind which may be more easily imagined than described. The Governor and suite arrived at these Plains on Thursday the 4th of May and encamped on the southern or left bank of the Macquarrie River–the situation being selected in consequence of its commanding a beautiful and extensive prospect for many miles in every direction around it. At this place the Governor remained for a week which time he occupied in making excursions in different directions through the adjoining country on both sides the river. On Sunday the 7th of May the Governor fixed on a site suitable for the erection of a town at some future period to which he gave the name of Bathurst in honour of the present Secretary of State for the Colonies. The situation of Bathurst is elevated sufficiently beyond the reach of any floods which may occur and is at the same time so near to the river on its south bank as to derive all the advantages of its clear and beautiful stream. The mechanics and settlers of whatever description who may be hereafter permitted to form permanent residences to themselves at this place will have the highly important advantages of a rich and fertile soil with a beautiful river flowing through it for all the uses of man. The Governor mut however add that the hopes which were once so sanguinely entertained of this river becoming navigable to the Western Sea have ended in disappointment. During the week that the Governor remained at Bathurst he made daily excursions in various directions ; one of these extended 22 miles in a south-west direction and on that occasion as well as on all the others he found the country chiefly composed of vallies and plains separated occasionally by ranges of low hills; the soil throughout being generally fertile and well circumstanced for the purpose of agriculture or grazing. The Governor here feels much pleasure in being enabled to communicate to the public that the favourable reports which he had received of the country to the west of the Blue Mountains have not been by any means exaggerated. The difficulties which present themselves in the journey from hence are certainly great and inevitable but thsoe persons who may be inclined to become permanent settlers there will probably content themselves withvisiting this part of the colony but rarely and of course will have them seldom to encounter. Plenty of water and a sufficiency of grass are to be found in the mountains for the support of such cattle as may be sent over them ; and the tracks of fertile soil and rich pasturage which the new country affords are fully extensive enough for any increase of population and stock which can possibly take place for many years. Within a distance of ten miles from the site of Bathurst there is not less than 50000 acres of land clear of timber and fully one half of that may be considered excellent soil well calculated for cultivation. It is a matter of regrets that in proportion as the soil improves the timber degenerates ; and it is to be remarked that everywhere to the westward of the mountains it is much inferior both in size and quality to that within the present colony ; there is however a sufficiency of timber of tolerable quality within the district around Bathurst for the purposes of house-building and husbandry. The Governor has here to lament that neither coals nor limestone have been yet discovered in the western country ; articles in themselves of so much importance that the want of them must be severely felt whenever that country shall be settled. Having enumerated the principal and most important features of this new country the Governor has now to notice some of its live productions. All around Bathurst abounds in a variety of game ; and the two principal rivers contain a great quantity of fish but all of one denomination resembling the perch in appearance and of a delicate and fine flavour not unlike that of a rock cod. This fish grows to a large size and is very voracious. Several of them were caught during the Governor's stay at Bathurst and at the halting place on the Fish River. One of those caught weight 17 lb ; and the people stationed at Bathurst stated that they had caught some weighing 25 lb. The field game are the kangaroos emus black swans wild geese wild turkies bustards ducks of various kinds quail bronze and other pigeons &c. &c. The water mole or paradox also abounds in all the rivers and ponds. The site designed for the towns of Bathurst by observation taken at the Flag Staff which was erected on the day of Bathurst receiving that name is situated in latitude 33. 24. 30. south being also 27 1/2 miles north of Government House In Sydney and 94 1/2 west of it bearing west 20. 30. north 83 geographic miles or 95 1/2 statute miles ; the measured road distance from Sydney to Bathurst being 140 English miles. The road constructed by Mr Cox and the party under him commences at Emu Ford on the left bank of the river Nepean and is thence carried 101 1/2 miles to the flag staff at Bathurst. This road has been carefully measured and each mile regularly marked on the trees growing on the left side of the road proceeding towards Bathurst. The Governor in his tour made the following stages in which he was principally regulated by the consideration of having good pasturage for the cattle and plenty of water :– 1st stage–Spring Wood distant from Emu Ford 12 miles 2d stage ditto–Jamieson's Valley or 2d depot distant from ditto . . . . . . . . . . 28 3d ditto–Blackheath distant from ditto . . . 41 4th ditto–Cox's River distant from ditto . . .56 5th ditto–The Fish River distant from ditto . 72 6th ditto–Sidmouth Valley distant from ditto . 80 7th ditto–Campbell River distant from ditto . 91 8th ditto–Bathurst distant from ditto . . . 101 1/2 At all of which places the traveller may assure himself of good grass and water in abundance. On Thursday the 11th of May the Governor and suite set out from Bathurst on their return and arrived at Sidney on Friday the 19th Ult. The Governor deems it expedient here to notify to the public that he does not mean to make any grants of land to the westward of the Blue Mountains until he shall receive the commands of his Majesty's Ministers on that subject and in reply to the report he is now about to make them upon it. In the mean time such gentlemen or other respectable free persons as may wish to visit this new country will be permitted to do so on making a written application to the Governor to that effect who will order them to be furnished with written passes. It is at the same time strictly ordered and directed that no person whether civil or military shall attempt to travel over the Blue Mountains without having previously applied for and obtained permission in the above prescribed form. The military guard stationed at the first depot on the mountains will receive full instructions to prevent the progress of any persons who shall not have obtained regular passes. The necessity for the establishing and strictly enforcing this regulation is too obvious to every one who will reflect on it to require any explanation here. The Governor cannot conclude this account of his tour without offering his best ackowledgements to William Cox Esq. for the important services he has rendered to the colony in so short a period of time by opening a passage to the new discovered country and at the same time assuring him that he shall have great pleasure in recommending his meritorious services on this occasion to the favourable consideration of his Majesty's Ministers.  ID121,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1817,07,21,entertain,Emigration to America. [ Extracted from No.15 of Cobbet's Register published on Saturday 12th instant ]. Cobbett's arrival in America&c. On Wednesday evening the 27th March we embarked on board the Importer D. Ogden master bound to New York where we arrived on the 5th of May with about 40 steerage passengers farmers and tradesmen who were fleeing from ruin and starvation. In all respects that can be named our passage disagreeable and upon one occasion very perilous from lightning which struck the ship twice shivered two of the masts killed a man struck several people slightly between two of whom I was sitting without at all feeling the blow. Some of our fellow-passengers have found great disappointment ; and it is stated in some of the public papers here that many hundreds have during the last year accepted of the offer of our Consul at New York to go and settle in Canada. You know that I have never advised any body to emigrate. I have always said that it is no place for manufacturers ; no place for men to live without work ; no place for a farmer who does not work himself ; no place in short for any one who is not able and willing to work at the ordinary sorts of work ; but for such men there is every where a plentiful happy and easy life. None should come however who have any views of idleness ; and even for the industrious poor I see no reason why they should expend their last shilling and undergo all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage in order to save those who eat the taxes the expence of their share of poor-rates ; a man and his wife and a child or two cannot come under the expence of 35 guineas at least. A single man 20 guineas before he gets into work again ; and as I always said I never would if I were in the place of such a man expend my earnings on a sea voyage and endure all its hardships in order to remove one eye sore out of the way of corruption. Besides there is the climate which is not so good as ours though it is not bad and people often live to an old age. The country is good but it will easily be conceived that new face an entire new scene a separation from every friend work done in a quite different way from it is in England ; it will easily be conceived that all this makes such a dislocation in a man's mind as to make him very unhappy for a while. Then he cannot expect to find work the first day. He must ask first at any rate. Englishmen are sheepish ; and they are sure to find rascals enough here to foster their disgust merely for the sake of serving the cause of corruption at home. In short I advice nobody to emigrate but I will truly describe the country and the people. As to emigrating with a view of settling and farming in the new countries it is neither more nor less than downright madness. It is what our English farmers know nothing at all about ; it is what they are not at all fit for ; and the far greater part of all such spe culations end in disappointment if not in ruin and premature death. I hope that our beloved country will shortly be fit for an honest and industrious man to live in ; but if any farmers come with money in their pockets my advice is not to give way either to enthusiastic admiration or to instant disgust. But to stop a little ; to look about them ; to see not only after good land but a good market for its products. The western romance writers tell us that the land in the Ohio is too good ; but Mr Mellish in his valuable book tells us that beef and pork sell for three halfpence a pound. An excellent country for people who want to do nothing but eat. – Give me Long Island where the land is not too good ; but where beef and pork sell for about eightpence a pound (I speak of English money); where good hay sells for five pounts a ton ; and where there is a ready market for every species of produce. One thing above all ; if an English farmer (I mean by English people of the whole of the United Kingdom) comes here with money in his pocket let him resolve to keep it there for a year and then he will be sure to do well. – All that I see around me here is well calculated to attract the attention and to please the sight of one like myself brought up in the country always greatly delighted with and somewhat skilled in various pleasing and healthful pursuits. The The people are engaged busily in planting their Indian corn. The cherry trees of which there are multitudes planted in long avenues or rows or round the fields have dropped their blossom and begin to show their loads of fruit. The apple and pear orchards in extent from one to twenty acres on each farm are in full and beautiful bloom. The farms are small in extent ; no appearance of want amongst the labourers who receive in the country about two shillings and threepence (our money) a-day with board and lodging and which board consists of plenty of excellent meat and fish of all sorts the best of bread butter cheese and eggs. That you may form some idea as to prices of living I will state a few facts which have already come within my own knowledge. We are at present at an inn thirteen miles from New York. It is on the road to that city. Scarcely an hour in the day passes without a carriage of some sort offering for going thither and to go by the regular stage costs three shillings. Mind I shall always speak in English money when I do not speak of dollars. We lodge and board in this inn have each a bed-room and good bed have a room to sit in ourselves ; we eat by ourselves ; and it really is eating. – We have smoked fish chops butter and eggs for breakfast with bread (the very finest I ever sa) crackers sweet cakes ; and when I say that we have such and such things I do not mean that we get them for show or just enough to smell to ; but in loads. Not an egg but a dish full of eggs. Not a snip of meat or of fish ; but a plateful. Lump sugar for our tea and coffee ; not broke into little bits the size of a hazle nut but in good thumping pieces. For dinner we have the finest of fish bass mackerel lobsters ; of meat lamb veal ham &c. ; asparagus in plenty ; apple pieces (through in the middle of May). The supper is like the breakfast with preserved peaches and other things. And with all this an excellent cyder to drink with the kindest and most obliging treatment on the part of the landlord and landlady and their sons and daughters we pay no more than 22s. 6d. a week each. In England the same food and drink and lodging at an inn would cost us nearly the same sum every day. But there are two things which no money can purchase any where. The first is no grumbling on the part of the landlady except on account of our eating and drinking too little ; and the other is that Mr Wiggins has no fastening but a bit of chip run in over the latch of the door to a house which is full of valuable things of all sorts and about which we leave all our things much more carelessly than we should do in our own house in any part of England. Here then are we able to live at an inn one of the most respectable in the whole country at the rate of fifty pounds a year while the pay of a common farming man is not much short of that sum.  ID122,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,01,inform,Emigration The authenticity of the following details of the miseries endured by some German emigrants proceeding from Amsterdam to America is we are told guaranteed ; otherwise they are almost too shocking to admit to belief : Libson Nov. 4 We have just been witnesses here of an event which has renewed those gloomy reflexions which the friends of humanity have indulged ever since the commencement of the emigration from Germany and Switzerland to America. We have deplored the error which led so great a number of unhappy persons to expartiate themselves in the hope of finding a happier lot upon the shores of the new world. But it is less to the blindness of the victims of this error than to the abominable speculations of cupidity that we are to attribute these numerous emigrations. the misery of the people of Germany and Switzerland occasioned by a superabundance of population and by the bad harvests of late years serves for aliment to the avarice of certain men who seek to establish criminal projects upon bases almost as obnoxious as those of the former slave trade. Such calculations deserve the attention of Governments and it is with this view that we think is our duty to make known the fate of an expedition of this kind fitted out at Amsterdam last August. But we shall first transcribe from the original the article of the charter party relative to the power reserved by the Captain over the persons of the passengers as inlcuding stipulations which are most characteristic of the nature of that odious traffic :– We passengers promise to fulfil faithfully the following conditions:– With respect to the price of the passage above stipulated for so much as we have not yet paid we engage to gain by our labour in America what we owe and we who owe the whole amount of our passage are bound if required and if we are unable to find better conditions to hire ourselves for four or five years in order to pay for our passage ; and we who have only paid for a part of our passage equally promise to let ourselves out to work for the same time for the sum we still owe. We promise besides we passengers men or women fathers or mothers children and families here assembled the children for their parents the parents for their children the brother for his brother and the sister for her sister when we shall find an opportunity to employ ourselves in America to engage ourselves in service and to answer for one for the other one for all the others whether he be of our family or not so that the price of the passage be diminished or augmented as much as shall be necessary until we all and our families have employment and the captain be no loser by us ; knowing very well that we passengers who have children a family brothers and sisters ought all to sumbit to our wives or husbands our children our brothers our sisters being sent separately to whatever place in order to gain in private service profession or labour or in any manner that shall be deemed best the price of our passage ; and in order that we may not in any case refused the engagements proposed to us or contract others without the permission not knowledge of the capain it is agreed for those who have not yet paid for their passage for those who still owe part and for those who cannot find an engagement that they must consent to me the captain carrying them to such place in America as it shall please me and wherever I may find it expedient to proceed or wherever it may suit me to sail. These horrible conditions were signed by 300 passengers. They had contracted with the Captain of a Dutch ship which was to proceed first to Baltimore. She in the worst state when she sailed from Amsterdam and in defiance of the clauses of the contract by which the Captain had engaged to feed them properly during the voyage he had not even embarked the necessary quanitity of provisions ; for after 62 days navigation the leaks had so gained upon the ship that she was in danger of sinking and famine had already made frightful ravages. It was at the end of that time and in this deplo rable condition that she was forced into Belem near Lisbon. Long before her arrival on our coasts the passengers had been reduced to the greatest misery not more by the small quantity than by the bad quality of the provisions. The water was gone and sea-water was their only drink. So much had they been wasted that forty had already died of famine. Among the rest there were a great many sick some of who have died since their arrival in Portugal. The situation of the vessel had at first given great alarm to our Council of Health who apprehensive of contagion were for an instant fearful that it would be necessary to force her out to sea. That would have been a misery so much the more formidable because the ship was not in a state to keep the sea and all must infallibly have perished. Happily this was deemed unnecessary and a quarantine was ordered. The Regency of Lisbon determined that provisions and other succours should be furnished at the expence of the State. All the Consuls were most active and benevolent in affording assistance. Such was the result of the expedition. Many others have no doubt answered as little the expectations of those who seduced by deceitful promises have emigrated to America in search of happiness which they could not find abandoning their country their parents and their friends. In July a Hamburgh ship with 106 Swiss passengers was at Lisbon in nearly the same distress with the Dutch ship. It is said here that there is a company in Holland which has numerous agents to seduce men to emigrate. It heaps them pell mell on board ships and if they reach their destination they are soon con vinced of the fallacy of all their hopes. It would be a desirable thing for papers in countries where these emigrations are excited to insert the article relative to the charter party given above in order that the simple and credulous may see what they have to undergo.  ID139,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,01,inform,Leeds April 19.–We have been somewhat alarmed here to-day though no bad consequences have followed by a most numerous assemblage of croppers cloth-dressers and other artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep com ing in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley Armley Holbeck and all the neighbouring towns and villages and it is computed that at one time there were full three thousand of these distressed people assembled chiefly in Briggate. As many of them marched into the town with great sticks in their hands they created some little alarm but their conduct was uniformly peaceable; their complaints were not loud though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and Magistrates with the whole of the Civil Power were in rea diness to act as circumstances might require; but fortunately there was not the slightest occasion for their interference. By far the greater number of the assemblage dispersed by noon and returned to their respective homes. Several respectable gentlemen went among them to ascertain the motives of their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it does not appear that they have the least disposition to commit any breath of the peace ; but in fact the people know not what to do in their present state of distress. I understand that an active subscription is going to enable a number of these poor men to proceed to Canada; and others are said to have expressed their wish to be sent to Botany Bay provided they can obtain the sanction of Government. The case of these people is a very perplexing one ; for their numbers augment daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories. Chester April 19.–John Bagguely John Drummond and Samuel Johnson convicted of sedition on the 15th inst. were this day after an adrdress from the Chief-Justice (Mr Serjeant Copley) sentenced to two years' imprisonment and to find security for their good behaviour for two years each in L.500 himself with sureties in L.100 each. We are sorry to hear that great number of the agricultural poor are out of employ in Monmouthshire and that the amount of wages diminishes as works get scarcer. Emigration to America still continues; but it is for the most part of a description of person who have afforded employ to others rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some property with them. Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States there are twenty six persons belonging to one family (Quakers of the name of Thistlewaith) lately residing in Meadow lane Leeds. These industrious and enterprising individuals are gone with an intention of carrying on the woollen manufacture (in conjunction with others) on an extensive scale either at Philadelphia or some other more eligible site in its vicinity. Several other families are preparing to emigrate from the same neighbourhood as well as from Dewsbury Bradford and other places in the vicinity. It is true these extensive emigrations may in some degree contribute to relieve our overburdened population ; but they must likewise tend in an equal ratio to impoverish the nation ; as every individual and family who emigrate setting aside the pecuniary wealth they carry with them take what is of far more consequence to a commercial nation–their talents and industry–articles at present of comparative small value in the country. The very heavy impost which is at present levied upon authors and publishers by being compelled under the existing Copyright Act to deliver eleven copies of every book published to certain public libraries is likely to be repealed by a Bill to be brought into Parliament in a few days. The body of evidence taken before the Select Committe of the House of Commons last year forms a most interesting display of the state of literary property in this country. Saturday last Mr Stuart and Mr Allsop were returned for the Borough of Camelford. Yesterday the Grand Jury for the County of Middlesex found two Bills of Indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury against five of the principal witnesses produced in behalf of the petitioner who were examined before the Select Committee appointed to try the merits of the election fo Penrhyn. Extraordinary Legacy. –A very singular cause is now depending before the Court of Session in Scotland respecting a legacy to the amount of upwards of fifty thousand pounds bequeathed by the late Earl of F. (who died at Berlin) to a foreigner who was one of his domestic servants. The payment of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the late Earl on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consideration ; and from its novelty the case is of course the subject of much conversation in the Northern Metropolis. The arguments and pleadings in this extraordinary suit in which the most eminent counsel of the Edinburgh Bar are engaged display much classical as well as legal learning ; but no judgement has yet been pronounced by the Court. From the magnitude of the sum in dispute it will probably be finally determined by an appeal to the House of Lords.– Morn. Chron. Town Hall Southwark. –Thomas Wing was brought up by Reeve the Marshalman and examined before Sir John Earner[?] the sitting Magistrate charged on suspicion of robbing his employers Messrs Sentance and Flint grocers NO. 300. Borough High-street. The prisoner's detection was caused in the following singular manner :–He was porter to the prosecutors and was frequently about the shop ; a large house dog having seen him take money from the till which he tied in his pocket handkerchief followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a shed near the stables and then he came into the shop and appeared quite restless pulling every person by the skirt[?] and apparently wishing them to follow him. At length Henry Heydon the apprentice having occasion to go to the stable the dog followed him and having drawn his attention to the heap of rubbish under which the money was buried began to scratch at it till he brought the booty to view ! The apprentice brought it to his master who counted and found it to contain 12s. in copper coin. After marking it he desired the boy to place it in the same spot which he did and soon afterwards finding that it was removed he asked the prisoner some questions about it but he declared his ignorance of the whole transaction. Reeve the Marshalman was then sent for who on searching the prisoner found some of the marked ballpence[?] in his pocket.–Remanded. Bank Committee. –The Opposition Journals last wek asserted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House of Commons intend to report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of paying in specie. That is the Bank shall pay next January in gold bars at the present price of gold L.4 1s. per ounce any quanitity of notes not being less than sixty or a hundred pounds' worth and that in two years afterwards they shall pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold L.3 17s. 10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's plan goes farther. It recommends that the Bank shall never pay in coin but in bars of gold at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall at all times buy gold when offered at L.3 17s. and sell it when demanded at L.3 17s. 10 1/2d. If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the Restriction Committee intend to report in favour of payments in bullion at the market price ; and should Parliament adopt that plan ; then there will be a very great saving to the nation in the expense of coinage the waste of &c. All the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in foreign commerce will be answered as well by payments in gold bars as by payments in coins and the danger of a domestic run on the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic as in 1797 will be completely prevented. This is indeed at all times the only danger to which it is exposed. A run for coin on the Country Banks would instantly fall on the Bank of England and would cramp if not dry upthe currency throughout the empire producing the greatest confusion. Now if the Opposition Journals be correct the currency will be placed in perfect security at perfect ease. Nothing will be able to disorder it. If persons will hoard specie they must purchase gold bars or foreign coin or content themselves with silver. In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the amount of L.800000 each year and then the value of gold was rather below the standard price. In the year 1817 we imported to the amount of six millions and in the year 1818 we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. During the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have an abundant harvest or two and little importation of corn become necessary gold will again fall very low. The Bank will then be able to pay to buy gold to the full extent of Mr Ricardo's plan and to place their notes on a firm unquestionable foundation. The finances of the continent and of the world indeed–the sources and circulation of money will during peace gradually become steadier and better known. The East Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quantity of specie while Spanish America in consequence of her troubles yields far less than usual. It would be madness to fly in the face of all these circumstances by compelling the Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may be desirable to limit the issue of bank notes to some certain yet liberal amount. We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the Committee ; but if some rumours be true we augur favourably of it. It[?] is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee and stood alone in voting against the Report. Thus then the Report cannot be in favour of a very sudden or decided plan for the resumpion of cash payments or Mr Tierney would not have voted against it ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable prospect of a rational scheme for that resumption or the other five or six Opposition Members of the Committee would not have voted for it. – Courier. Grand Pigeon Match three Gentlemen of the Midgham Club against thrice of All England took place on Monday on Farnham Downs at twenty-one birds twenty-one yards distance from the gun for 150 guineas aside charge unlimited. Messrs Adams Russel and Holt were selected from the Crack Club against Messrs King Short and Keans. The sports were as follows ; Mr Adams killed nineteen birds and the remaining two were severely hit. Russel killed eighteen but lost one three yards out of bounds and Mr Holt bagged sixteen making a grand total of fifty-two from sixty-three. The Club was at first backed to win but the England shots were now backed freely at six to four as they were considered safe eighteen bird men. Mr King killed twenty but lost two out of bounds. Short missed his first three which brought betting to two to one onn the Club but he killed the next seventeen and missed the last bird. Mr Keans had seventeen to tie and eighteen to win and he was back at five to four and at two to one after killing eleven birds in succession. He however missed the seventeenth and had to kill the other four to win. He succeeded and the prize was won by once bird. It was altogether the most interesting match of this sort known for years. Letters from Petersburgh of the 15th ultimo mention that Prince Gustavus of Sweden son of King Gustavus IV. has obtained permission from the Emperor his uncle to proceed to England for the purpose of completing his studies at Oxford. Reports speak highly of the virtues and talents of this unfortunate young Prince who excites universal interest and sympathy in the north of Europe. In these feelings we must largely share for we cannot easily forget the associations with which the name of Vasa was connected not the services rendered by two Sovereigns of that Illustrious House to the cause of civil and religious liberty. It is said that a great Potentate whose generosity and magnanimity are proverbial has settled upon Prince Gustavus an allowance of L. 2000 Sterling per annum during the residence of the latter in England and that on the return of his Royal Highness to the Continent he is to espouse his cousin a Princess of Hesse Cassel who if rumour be correct has lately refused a matrimonial alliance with the new Swedish dynasty. Papers arrivedon Saturday from New York and Boston to the 15th ult. The National Intelligencer in an article occupying five columns under the head of Strictures on Mr Lacock's Report on the Seminole War defends the sanguinary proceedings of General Jackson. This production is said to have excited a great sensation throughout the United States being supposed to express the sentiments of the Executive. The General had left Washington for his residence in Tenessee. By an arrival from Aux Cayes intelligence was stated to be received that Sir G M'Gregor's troops had deserted him owing to the want of funds for their subsistence.  ID186,Glasgow Herald,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1821,02,05,inform,Emigration. The following is an extract of a letter dated Louisville August 12th 1820 from a Scotchman who has been long settled in America to his friend a Scotch Farmer who rents 500 acres of land in the County of Middlesex. The circumstances in which this country is placed at present are truly melancholy when compared to what they have been ; yet still it is a better country to live in than Britain. It is not easy to make money by farming at present in the United States for the want of a market; and I am of opinion that things will not mend in this respect for some years for all are sellers and none buyers. All kinds of produce are selling or rather offered for sale at one-third of what prices were two years ago. Land of course has fallen in the same ratio. The best of cleared land within from 5 to 10 miles of this town is offered for them from 10 to 20 dollars an acre. You will thence conclude that this is a favourable time to purchase – and that for a man who has a little money and a large family able and willing to labour with their hands this is a most excellent country as he can easily raise on this cheap land all the necessaries and many of the luxuries of life. He will find it difficult to get gold or silver or even our own bad bank notes; but a man cannot be badly off with more beef mutton pork and grain than he can dispose of. He has no rent to make up by term day: his taxes are next to nothing and although he may grumble to have to turn his pigs into his corn field to save the expense of reaping it or to see his apples rotting under his trees by barn-fulls because he has not room or use for them yet still these are beatable distresses compared to those of the poor farmers in our native land and as I suppose in England. To the wealthier farmer the change is not beneficial or desirable. It is true that if he stays long in Britain he will soon become less wealthy; yet still he would for some time regret the change. He would miss many things made necessary by habit; he would find his servants more lazy and less obedient ; and he would even experience pain because the modes of farming he is accustomed to will not do here; but when he gets over these things he will find the advantage of the change. To say nothing of the difference of the Government and the satisfaction of chusing one's own rulers there are many desirable things here. I estimate as the greatest the ease of providing for one's family. A man may with very little exertion leave to all his children land enough to make them independent. Hence that sickening anxiety about the future fate of a family is little known here.  ID188,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1822,10,19,inform,On Monday 14 instant the ship Andromeda of London James Muddle master sailed from Leith Roads for New South Wales with 67 passengers all of whom are very respectable people.

The quantity announced for sale to-day was nearly 200 bales consisting of about 100 bales of New South Wales wool 50 bales of Van Dieman's Land wools &c. The New South Wales wool was first put up and went off very briskly at prices averaging from 1s 4 1/2d to 1s 10d per lb. which quotations are higher than those last obtained. The Van Dieman's Land wools were sold by order of the Van Dieman's Land Company being a portion of the last arrivals from the Company's flocks. They met a very ready sale and the average prices obtained were from 1s 5d to 2s 1d per lb. The arrivals from Germany and other places this year are expected to be very great.  ID227,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1833,05,29,inform,Trade Wool –The accounts received in Lond from New South Wales to the 8th of January state that the produce of the last year's clip of wool in Australia will be greatest than that of the preceding year and the the quality has also considerably improved. From Van Dieman's Land it is now ascertained that the supply this year will be short but the general quality is very superior. In the course of about a week or ten days large arrivals of wool are looked for from New South Wales and the private contract business is expected to be very active. The public sales of wools went off on Friday very well and at full prices. The arrivals of this week have consisted of about 708 bales of which about 292 bales were Van Dieman's Land wools and the rest German. There is a steady demand and as it is understood that the manufacturers are short of stock the anticipations are that trade will son be greatly improved. York Wool Market May 23.–The market commenced here for this season this day with only a small show of wool and not many buyers. The holders asking very high prices caused part to be left unsold. The following are the prices ; Hogs from 18s to 19s ; Hogs and Ewes 16s 6d to 17s 6d ; Locks 11s to 12s 6d per stone of 16lbs. Bradford Market –The supply of Merinos in the markets on Thursday evening was by no means equal to the demand–all qualities in six quarter wide Merinoes were eagerly bought up and in some instances a farther advance was obtained ; three quarter wide Merinoes run much in demand but a very scanty supply ; the advance on six quarter wide Merinoes is from 4s to 6s per piece compared with what was given at the beginning of the year and three quarter wide are proportionably higher. Unless a reduction takes place in the price of wool the manufacturers state they must have a further advance. Rochdale Flannel Market. –The market today was very lively for this season of the yar ; low goods both for white and for dyeing were of very ready sale and in some instances a little advance was obtained ; several sales were effected in fine qualities and if the demand proves permanent the prospect for the coming season is very promising. Liverpool Cotton Market. –There has been but a limited inquiry for cotton during the week ; the sales are only about 10000 bugs at declining prices.  ID232,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1833,09,25,inform,The Wool Trade. –The whole of the London public sales of Colonial and other woold having now been gone through the wool trade is in a more settled state and transactions by private contract are conducted on a more extensive scale. The total amount of the late sales the last of which took place on Tuesday was 4000 bales and the colonial wools were taken by the manufactures at the extreme advance realized at the previous sales in July. In some cases indeed quotations from 2d to 3d per lb. in advance were obtained. The sales on Saturday was most fully attended and increased boldness was observed. The colonial wools offered on that day fetched excellent prices. Some few bales were also offered forming a part of the second clip of wools in the new colony on the Swan River. They were much better in quality than those last received. Some German lambs' wool also commanded attention and sold as high as 3s 10d to 4s per lb. The sale on Tuesday (the last of the series) was not quite so fully attended as those of last wekk but according to quality full prices were obtained. The sale consisted of 437 bales New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land wool 96 bales of Portugal wool 54 Spanish and 72 bales of Cape German Russian and other wools. The best fleece of Amsterdam offered fetched 2s 10d to 3s 2d and seconds 2s 3d to 2s 7 1/2d per lb ; the best Portugal 1s 2d to 1s 11d ; the best Spanish 2s 5d to 2s 8d ; the best Cape 1s 4d to 1s 8d ; the best Van Diemen's Land 1s 8d to 1s 10d ; and the best German 2s to 2s 3d per lb. The result of these sales is to establish a much firmer market for wools of all descriptions than previously existed. The arrivals of wool are limited and this week only 575 bales of German wool and abotu 375 bales of Neapolitan wool have been entered at the custom house.  ID308,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1841,12,29,inform,Theatre Royal. –The Pantomine we observe is postponed till Friday. Meanwhile the theatre is crowded nightly the public being admitted at second price from the commencement of the performances. Music Hall. –We stated about two month ago that in connection with other improvements in the Assembly Rooms a plan was under consideration for erecting a Music Hall. We are now happy to announce that at a meeting of the proprietors of the Rooms last week full pwers were given to the Directors to take the requisite steps for carrying the design into execution. The desire so long felt by the cultivators of music here will soon be realisd by the erection of a splendid hall constructed with a due regard to the accommodation both of professional men and the public and with a minute attention to the most recent improvements by which full effect is secured to musical performances when conducted on a grand scale. By what may be called a propitious coincidence Mr Bishop the new Professor of Music arrived in Edinburgh on the very day when this resolution was come to. Martin's Paintings. –The exhibition of these celebrated paintings in this city has already we believe attracted many visitors. They are truly wonderful creations and possess a power and grandeur of which the engravings so familiar to the public convey but a faint conception. In contemplating the Deluge the spectator is so [?] [?] [?] the scene that he is apt to overlook the details; but these will be found on inspection to be among the most interesting features of the picture. The groups of perishing beings are exquisitely wrought while everything is made to contribute to the terrific grandeur of the catastrophe. The other two pictures–Pandemonium and the Rivers of Bliss are smaller in size but equally indicative of the high poetic genius of the artist. Nothing could be more striking than the contrast these pictures present to each other–the one fearful beyond expression the other exhibiting a heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the eye rests with delight. There are several other valuable paintings in this collection amongst which is The Offering Up of Isaac a Rembrandt in fine preservation. Gordon's British Diorama. –This beautiful exhibition opened on Saturday last and has we understand been crowded with visitors ever since. It will be seen by Mr Gordon's advertisement in to-day's paper that the view of the Tower of London during the recent conflagration (to which we alluded in our last) has now arrived and is being exhibited along with the other views. Broughton-place Congregation.–We understand that the call given by BroughtonPlace Congregation to the Rev. Mr Croon Sanquhar to be colleague to the Rev. Dr. Brown has not been accepted owing to the strong claims which the affectionate people among whom he presently labours have to continuance of his services and his unfitness as he alleges for a charge so laborious; a result which we learn has caused among the members of Broughton-Place extreme and general regret. Cooke's Equestrian Amphitheatre Leith. –Mr Cooke has generously handed over to the Provost for the benefit of the Destitute Sick Society the handsome sum of t15; being the free proceeds of Friday evening's entertainment which took place under the patronage of the Provost and Magistrates. Captain Ross' Discoveries. –Extracts from Captain Ross' despatches have been published in a Parliamentary paper. From the map which accompanies the paper we gain a more distinct idea of his track than the previous article copied from the Athenean[?] afforded. South Victoria Land which he discovered extends in latitude from 70 1/2 south to 79 how much farther is unknown; and in longitude its eastern coast lies between 163 and 171. Its position is directly south from New Zealand and at the distance of 1500 geographical miles. The length of the part seen was fully 500 miles. It was girt with a border of ice many miles in breadth which rendered it inaccessible. The passage southward was closed at latitude 78 by a barrier of ice 150 feet high which was traced for 300 miles east from Victoria Land. Icebergs were encountered in numbers after they passed parallel of 63 and pack ice at 66. The land rose in lofy peaks from 9000 to 12000 feet in height perfectly covered with eternal snow; the glaciers descended from near the mountain summits project many miles into the ocean and presented a perpendicular face of lofty cliffs. They could not reach the mainland but landed on an island which they found to consist of volcanic rocks. On 28th January in latitude 77 1/2 longitude 169 E. they discovered a magnificent volcano emitting smoke and flame in a splendid profusion and named it Mount Erebus. An extinct one near it was named after the other vessel Mount Terror. At the distance of less than half a mile from the ice cliffs which barred their progress southward they had sound ings with 318 fathoms. These cliffs no doubt reached the bottom and including the 150 feet above water must have had an elevation fo 2000 feet of thereabout. The observations on the dip and declination induced them to place the South Magnetic Pole in latitude 76 and east longitude 153; and they considered its position as well ascertained as if they had reached it though their nearest approach to it was a point 160 miles from it on the east coast of Victoria Land. The pole is probably within that region though this cannot be positively affirmed as its western boundary is unknown. The highest latitude they reached 78. 4. They were therefore only 12 degrees from the pole and about 4 degrees nearer to it than Captain Weddel[?] the most successful of their predecessors. The Non-intrusion Disclosures. –In the Advertiser of yesterday there is a letter from J. M. Hog Esq. of Newliston and another from the Rev. Dr Simpson of Kirknewton both expressing their extreme surprise at the letter of Mr Hamilton (which appeared in our last) and strongly disclaiming all connexion with it on the part of the General Assembly's Committee. Sabbath Observance–The Sweetie Case. –We understand that the Government of Prussia thinking that the mode of keeping the Sabbath in that country was in some respects too lax recently sent over a person to this country to learn whether our practise in Britain would not furnish hints for improvement. Unluckily the very first specimens of our piety which met him were the sweetie case and that of the poor man Key who was excommunicated for burying his child on Sunday. These will of course figure in the very front of the officer's report as the natural fruits of our system and we may guess what their effect will be in reconciling the Germans to a stricter observance of Sunday! We can moreover inform Butters' prosecutors that the fame of their exploits has already travelled by the aid of the Teutonic newspapers to the uttermost parts of Germany to the infinite amusement of the Swabian farmers the Saxon miners and the shepherds of the Riesengeberge. Key's case is no doubt destined to enjoy equal celebrity. Airdrie–Anti-Corn-Law Conference. – On Monday last the members of the United Secession Church Airdrie favourable to a repeal of the Corn and Provision Laws met in compliance with the request of the Committee taking the active management of the Conference to be held in Edinburgh on the second week in January next on that subject when they unanimously appointed their pastor the Rev. Matthew M'Gavin A.M. Mr John Craig Waddell proprietor and Mr James Forrester merchant in Airdrie to represent their sentiments at that meeting which is looked forward to with great interest by the liberal portion of the inhabitants of the burgh. The Rev. Mr Taylor with Messrs Adam Nimmo contractor and John Young bookseller will represent the Independent congregation; and Mr Thomas Muir pastor of the Baptist church will represent that body on that occasion. Kirkcudbright–Address to the Dean of Faculty –We learn that at a meeting held on the 17th current of the Clerks and Procurators of the Steward and COmmissary Courts an address was voted to Alexander Wood Esq. on his appointment to the office of Dean of Faculty and his retirement from that of Steward of Kirkcudbright. Distress in Paisley. –We understand that the Bookbinders of Edinburgh purpose to give a Grand Musical Melange in a few days the proceeds of which are to be handed over to the committee for the distressed weavers in Paisley. Musselburgh. –Mr Wilson Treasurer to the Honest Town has by the hands of the district committeesm collected from the contributors to the Prince of Wales fund nearly t100; and the committees have already distributed 130 tons of coals to the necessitous families in the neighbourhood. Presbytery of Dalkeith–Case of Mr Monroe. –This Presbytery met on Tuesday the 21st current. At a former meeting an agent appeared for Mr Monroe presentee to Fala and laid on the table of Presbytery a presentation in his favour to the parish of Fala. It having been objected that the presentation and some other papers relative thereton bore that Mr Monroe was presented merely to the parish of Fala and not to the united parishes of Fala and Soutra the agent made his appearance again at the meeting which was held on Tuesday with a supplementary presentation and also a letter acceptance from Mr Monroe. The agent when asked admitted that he had not with him a Presbyterial certificate; and he stated that he would not ask the Presbytery to sustain the presentation with relative papers at that meeting. But he intimated that he intended to appear at the next meeting which is appointed to be held on the 22d of February and he expected to be able to show that the Presbytery should then sustain the presentation and relative documents. Splendid Meteor. –On Tuesday evening about eight o'clock a meteor of unusal size and splendour was witnessed in this quarter. The evening was very clear the sky being without a cloud and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly a dazzling blaze of light burst from the sky illuminating Benlomond and the distant hills the Curse around Craigforth and indeed the earth and air on every side as far as the eye could reach with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The phenomenon appeared like a ball of fire of an oblong shape and apparently almost twice the size of the moon having at the time somewhat of the same silvery appearance as that luminary but flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to dazzle the eyes. A tail of fire somewhat resembling that of a rocket but composed of the most beautifully varied colours streamed behind it for a short distance adding much to its spendour and giving the whole an appearance at once singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it disappeared it assumed a red glowing appearance and then burst for an instant enveloping the earth and sky in a blaze as bright and dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared to pass from the south to the north inclining towards the earth. To the eye it seemed to burst and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another meteor of the same kind but much less in size brilliancy and splendour was observed falling in a quartr rather farther to the south a few minutes previously. It is a coincidence worthy of notice that a meteor of the same nature with that first described in the above was seen at the same hour in Glasgow.– Stirly Journal. Glasgow. –The collection made on Sabbath afternoon last by the Rev. Mr Macfarlane's congregation Nicholson Street Glasgow amounted to t46 7s. 6d. This sum is the more praiseworthy when it is considered that this congregation has within a few months subscribed among themselves nearly t1000 for the erection of their beautiful place of worship to be called Erskine Church of which they are erelong to take possession. The Unemployed in Paisley.–The number of unemployed in Paisley has last week decreased by 43. In Kilbarchan and Barrhead they were still on the increase. The following is the official report of yesterday for Paisley and Barrhead :– Paisley. Males 1865 Dependants 4662 –6527 Females 1680 Dependants 3360 –5040 Total 11567 Barrhead. December 17 287 ... 23 346 Increase 59 – Paisley Advertiser. The Paisley Manufacturing Committee. –This Committee continue to carry on their operations with energy and zeal. The amount of the fund now exceeds t8000 and is still on the increase. They have given out about 700 webs already and are as busy as possible preparing more. Unable to get a sufficiency of webs warped in Paisley they have sent for assistance in this respect both to Glasgow and Johnstone. A good deal of work has this week been given to warpers winders and heddle-casters. They have taken much more spacious premises in Gilmour Street in order that they may the more easily supply both town and country weavers. It is desirable that the implement fund should be somewhat enlarged as the other funds of the Committee are not trenched on for that purpose – Ibid. Ducal Generosity.–After the late county meeting at Hamilton at which addresses were voted to the Queen and Prince Albert his Grace the Duke of Hamilton and several of those who had attended the meeting visited the jail. One respectable looking female attracted his Grace's attention; and on inquiry he was told that she was the widow of a respectable wood merchant now deceased and had been confined for upwards of a year at the instance of a law agent in Edinburgh for costs incurred in a suit in the Court of Session. His Grace immediately caused the truth of the poor woman's story to be investigated and on being satisfied of the facts he caused the debt to be paid by his factor and procured the woman's liberation who has thus through his Grace's generosity been restored to liberty and to the superintendence of her young family.– Reformers' Gazette. Presentation. –A number of the members of the United Secession Church Airdrie met in their vestry on the evening of Wednesday the 22d inst. when Councillor Brown in name of the congregation presented the Rev. M. M'Gavin A.M. their pastor with a handsome pulpit gown and cassock as a mark of their respect and esteem; after which a number of the influential members of the congregation entertained him to supper supper in Mr Witherspoon's King's Arms Inn– Mr Daniel Gray collector Coltness Railway in the chair and Dr Clarkson croupier–when the evening was spent in the most friendly happy and intellectual manner. A Rescue.–Last week while the Duke of Hamilton was riding along the wood leading from Hamilton to Bothwell he heard the screams of a female and on looking towards the place whence the cries came he perceived a stout Irishman belabouring a woman in a most unmerciful style. No sooner did he observe this than he rode up to the scene of cruelty dismounted from his horse knocked the savage down rescued the woman and sent her home rejoicing with more money in her pocket than it may have been her lot to possess for a long time. When we recollect that his Grace was born so long ago as October 1767 and so is in his 75th year we cannot sufficiently admire his gallantry humanity and intrepidity– Glasgow Chronicle. Town Council. –The usual meeting of Council did not take place yesterday in consequence of the Christmas holidays. House of Industry. –We understand that Miss Grace Bailie had left a legacy to the Edinburgh House of Industry of ten pounds sterling. Old Church.–The Lords of her Majesty's Treasury have officially intimated to the parties interested their intention to adhere to the original arrangement made with the Town Council for altering the Assembly Aisle and rendering it fit to be permanently used as a place of worship for the accomodation of one of the city congregations. Prince of Wales Fund. –In the table of sums subscribed in the different Wards of Police published in our paper of Saturday last that indicated for the 26th Ward was t120 12s. 9d. Mr Lindores the General Commissioner requests us to state that the sum subscribed in his Ward was t275 12s. 9d. and that the difference between the two sums is the amount of the very handsome subscriptions by the Banks in St Andrew Square and which were drawn by the Treasurer. Presentation of Plate. –On Friday afternoon about fifty citizens entertained Mr William Donaldson of the Albion Cloth Company to an elegant dinner and dessert in the Turf Hotel Princes Street for the purpose of presenting him with a testimonial of their esteem subscribed for by the members of the Celtic Lodge and other private friends. Mr William Wright hat manufacturer was in the chair supported on the right and left by the guest of the evening Mr Pritchard of the Theatre-Royal and other gentlemen. Mr Dick of the Albion officiated as croupier. After the usual loyal and preliminary toasts had been given the chairman called for a bona fide bumper for the toast of the evening and after passing a handomse eulogium on those various qualities of their guest which had endeared him to all his friends neighbours and acquaintances far and wide presented to Mr Donaldson in the name of the subscribers a very elegant and massive silver tea set of the value of t50. Mr Donaldon's health was then proposed and drunk with warm and friendly enthusiasm. The presentee replied to the compliment in modest and appropriate terms. The company spent an exceedingly happy and convivial night; the chairman and croupier taking care that there should be no flagging in the jovialty. The toasts were suitable to the occasion. Mr Mackenzie's instrumental band played appropriate airs to the various toasts and sentiments; and vocal music from amateurs was never wanting; the guest himself being a host in that department. The following inscription is neatly engraved on the various pieces of playe :–To Mr William Donaldson R.W.M. of the Lodge Celtic of Edinburgh and Leith from a number of Masonic and other Friends.–24th Dec. 1841. Theft and Recovery of a Pony. –At a late hour on Sunday night a gentleman residing in the southern part of the town dismounted from his pony at his own gate and proceeding inwards leaving the animal to follow as he was wont to do to the stable. On looking about he observed a young man whom he supposed to be his son take the reins and mount the pony. Shortly afterwards the son came into the house and the question of Where is the pony? soon convinced the parties that it was stolen. They immediately proceeded in search and while the gentleman was giving information at the Police-Office his son discovered the pony with a rider on the North Bridge. He immediately seized the reins and made a clutch at the thief; but the latter very adroitly threw himself off at the opposite side ran down the Fleshmarket stairs and escaped. Providential Recovery. –One day last week a fine little child about five years of age belonging to one of the villagers at Ratho having dandered[?] away with another little play-fellow like himself to a little distance from the house fell into a deep well. His companion was found standing weeping at the edge. The apparently dead body of the little one being got out was taken home and all hopes of its recovery given up when Dr Pringle and excellent young gentleman who is presently assistant of Dr Craig at Ratho made his appearance and by applying himself with indefatiguable perseverance succeeded in recalling the apparently extinguished spark. The next the little romp was as lively as ever. Mungo Park. –A public meeting was held in the town hall of Selkirk on Monday the 26th current the Chief Magistrate in the chair; when various resolutions were adopted with the view of erecting a monument or other permanent mark of respect for the memory of this celebrated traveller. Thimble-Riggers. –A band of thimble-riggers from Edinburgh have for several weeks past been infesting the roads in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. They are six in number and one of them an old man of rather respectable appearance is generally in advance of the party and having got into conversation with a passenger on the road and the others running up and desiring the old man to try his luck; he does so and winning a trifle he easily persuades the person with whom he has been ingratiating himself to try also and he is soon robbed of his whole spare cash. Information having on Wednesday last been given to the Procurator-Fiscal at Pollokshaws and the gang were on the new Kilmarnock Road he immediately despatched two rural police officers in pursuit of them. On the officers coming up to the gang they separated and ran off but the officers captured two of them (the old man and another) who were safely lodged in Pollokshaws Jail; and having been brought before two of the Justices and several person having sworn to being defrauded by them of their money they were sentenced tothirty days' imprisonment in Paisley House of Correction with hard labour as rogues and vagabonds; and an active look-out is made by the police for the remainder of the gang. Stoppage of Payments by the Town of Paisley. –Partly on account of the great depression of trade and partly on account of a run raised by the circulation of malicious and false statements regarding the affairs of the community of Paisley theTown Council at a meeting on Wednesday evening ordered the Chamberlain to susspend receipt or payment of deposits in the meantime but to proceed with all possible despatch in realizing the outstanding debts due to the community for the regular payment of the interest on the money borrowed and other current engagements of the burgh. It is pretty generally known that a small portion of the would-be-political leaders of the town who have not the influence to get themselves placed in municipal authority have for a good number of years endeavoured to embarass the party in power by attacking the credit of the community. The unfavourabout state of trade and the leniency of the Council in not enforcing during the last year the exactions on the owners of property for entries &c. falling due caused a deficiency of nearly t300 in the usual amount of revenue. This simple circumstance was taken advantage of though nothing was lost thereby and statements prejudicial to the town's credit were placed in the hands of every credito that could be found by the individuals referred to and thus uncalled for alarm raised. In addition to this the adherents of the same party in the Council during the last five days gave currency to another statement which they knew to be quite untrue about the late Provost having commenced to secure himself by drawing a thousand pounds when the fact was he had not drawn out a penny. From the position to which which the affiars the town are now driven a full and public exposure of these matters will soon be submitted to the creditors. The Council have been negotiating for such a loan of money as will pay off those who are dissatisfied which in the ordinary state of the money market they would long since have obtained though at present that is difficult. As regards risk to the creditors from the best informed quarters we are assured there is none. More than one-third of the whole debts of the town are due to the Bank and the members of Council or their immediate friends and fully a half of the debt against the river is due to the same parties. This we should conceive the strongest proof that could be adduced of the confidence of those who should best know the state of the town's affairs.– Glasgow Chronicle. Disgraceful Trick.–At a late wake in the country a short way from Crieff a waggish fellow tied a cord secretly to the neck of the corpse and while a number of young men and women present were going on merrily with some sport the wag pulled the cord when corpse started up in the bed making the clothes to fly off; the whole party rushed to the door crying for mercy upon them and knocking each other over in the hurry when at length some people came to their assistance who afterwards discovered the cause of their terror.– Perth Courier. The Church Question. –Long ago Dr Chalmers let out the secret of the clerical movement by declaring that very little of Non-intrustion would satisfy him and his friends provided the independent power of the Church were secured. Now this liberum arbitrium does nothing at all for Non-intrusion; but it does a great deal for Church Independence. It confers no privilege on the laity; but it adds immeasurably to the power of the clergy. It is in fact the very worst part of the claims that have been advanced by the Church; and its effects would simply be to sacrifice the lay Non-intrusionists on the one hand and clerical Moderates on the other. It means literally uncontrolled power to the Church The General Steam Navigation Company's ship Monarch Captain Fraser arrived at Granton from London on Monday evening at half-past nine o'clock. Election of a Minister for Old Monk- land. –The election of a minster took place at Old Monkland Church on Thursday the 23d inst. and the right of patronage being vested in the Heritors and Kirk-Session the election might be considered a popular one. About 150 voters attended the meeting and a decided wish having been expressed by it is understood the whole of the heritors that no candidate known to be connected with the Non-intrusion party in the Church should be chosen the meeting acting upon this principle unanimously agreed to elect the Rev. Mr Johnston Greenock as minister of the parish. Considering the number of voters the unanimity that prevailed among the electors it is believed is without precedent and stongly marks the sentiments and feelings of a large and very populous parish on the present proceedings of the dominant party in th Church. Mr Johnston was proposed by General Pye Douglass of Rosehall seconded by Mr M'Caul of Daldowie and unanimously elected.– Reformers' Gazette. Destructive Fire. –About three o'clock on the morning of the 25th curt. an alarm of fire was given at Balmangan Mill in the parish of Rerwick. The premises are occupied by Mr Kissock and despite the great exertions of himself servants and neighbours the work of destruction proceeded with a degree of rapidity that rendered it impossible to save a single article. The flames in their fury having charred the rafters the roof fell in with a loud crash; and before long the entire mill with the exception of the side walls became an unbroken mass of ruins. The building contained a considerable quantity of grain and oatmeal the property of the tacksman all of which was unforunately destroyed. As the premises were found quite safe a very few hours previously suspicion of incendiarism have naturally arisen but no clue thus far has been found attaching guilt to a single individual. The fire if wilful implies the blackest malice and it is sad to think that any one could have been so wicked as to destroy what thousands are in want of and would gladly toil for if they only knew how–daily bread– Dumfries Courier. Hamilton. –Some influential persons in Hamilton and the neighbourhood have subscribed to build an Episcopal chapel in that town. We have been informed that all the requisite arrangements have been made for carrying the views of the subscribers into effect. This is one effect of the conduct of the rebellious majority of the General Assembly. Many of thsoe now friendly to the scheme never dreamed of espousing Episcopacy till they have been driven in disgust from the Church of their fathers by the conduct of their ministers; men who exist in their offices by law and yet set that very law at defiance in virtue of which they hold offices and draw their temporalities as they cantingly term their good things which alone induce some of them at least to remain members of the venerable Establishment. Who would have believed some years ago that Black Prelacy was about to be established within sight of Bothwell Brigg!  ID319,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,05,02,inform,Nassau New England March 12. The red bugs which did so much injury to the cotton last year have again made their appearance but not in such numbers as was first expected. The hops in many States of America have been particularly productive. A letter from Great-Ogreechee in Georgia dated December 9th says since the completion of the treaty with the Creeks all has been very quiet unless we except some ill-natured state - bickerings and heart-burning amongst ourselves chiefly occasioned by a few influential men who find themselves great losers by a general act of common justice towards the Indians. These however we expect will subside by degrees; notwithstanding the formidable combination in a certain part of the State. As to the Creeks Siminoles and other nations adjoining our Western frontier nothing is clearer than that so far from being injurious to us they may henceforward be made useful to the real interests of this State provided the faith of treaties be observed.

Wednesday Dec. 8. The SPEECH of George Washington Esq; President of the Congress on??? the ??? Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives I N meeting you again I feel much satisfac tion on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary. In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of 3000000 of florins towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in Holland.–As well theexchange with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information. Since your last sessions I have received communication by which it appears that the district of Kentucke at present a part of Virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honour to both the par ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you. It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity. These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended. The disturbed situation of Europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge in means and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil. Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection. The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom whether improvement of a judicatory system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom whether im provements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts be not desirable through all the States. The patronage of our commerce of our merchants and seamen has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect. The establishment of the Militia of a Mint of Standards of Weights and Measures of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favourite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents. Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives. In perusing the various and weighty business of the present session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.

United States Dec. 8 1790.  ID368,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,07,25,advertise,LANDS in AMERICA for SALE. THESE two adjoining TRACKS of LAND in the County of FAYETTE and State of KENTUCKY. The one track consists of 7000 acres and is divided into 15 plantations of 500 acres each; eight of these plantations are still unsold and are now offered at the low price of 137l. being only 5s. 6d. per acre. The other track counsists of 3086 acres and is to be sold in one lot at 5s. 6d. per acre. There is a fine stream of water running through these two tracks of land which communicates with the great river Ohio so that Mills may be erect. In Fayette County is Lexington where the Courts of the State of Kentucky are held and where all public business is transacted Lexington is in the neighbourhood of these lands and Fayette county is the nearest and most convenient for Philadelphia Baltimore City of Washington &c. The soil of Kentucky is deep and black and lies upon a bed of lime-stone and coal. THe natural grown of the country are large walnuts honey poplar and sugar trees. The surface is covered with blue grass clover and wild rye grape vines running to the tops of the trees. Shrubs and plants grow spontaneously and afford a beautiful blossom of a rich and exquisite fragrance. Cotton and sugar are manufactured to advantage. wheat barley oats flax and hemp yield abundantly; indeed it is assumed that there have been raised 100 bushels upon one acre but the common produce is from 40 to 60 bushels an acre. Owing to the peculiar richness of the soil and fine climate of the country no part of America has been to repidly settled. The returns made to Congress upon 1st May 1792 state them at 76 000. In March 1793 there were upwards of 100000. And from their astonishing increase since they may be estimated at 200000. Eleven years ago Kentucky lay in a forest but now she exhibits an extensive settlement divided into seven populous counties in which are a great number of flourishing towns and contains more inhabitants than are in Georgia Delaware and Rhode Island States. There are about 70 churches in Kentucky and mostly PResbyterians. There is a College; and Schools are established in every town. There is a Printing-office; a Weekly Gazette published. There are Paper Mills O??? Mills???ing Mills Saw Mills and a great number of Grist Mills. Considerable quantities of Sugar are made from the Sugar Trees. Salt-works are in every part of the country and the inhabitants are supplied at a low price. The taxes upon land are very low. Any person who goes from Europe becomes an American Citizen on his arrival in this new State and is entitled to be elected to any office in the Commonwealth. For farther particulars apply to MR. John Granger writer to the signet; David Niven writer Glasgow; or to Mr. John Finlayson writer Cupar Fife;  ID384,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,09,28,inform,The American Congress have laid on port duties which may be deemed moderate in several particulars when compared to those of most of the European kingdoms and cities and in many instances are much less than heretofore imposed by the Provincial Assemblies. This may be hugly prudent in a republic which is courting commerce for her ports and for such a variety of articles the native products of that extensive region to give in return for fabrics not yet manufactuted among themselves. Their tobacco corn iron hemp flax lumber & are inexhaustible sources of wealth and their fisheries very considerable.  ID386,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,11,13,inform,Extract of a letter from a gentleman at Dumfries in Virginia to his correspondent in Glasgow dated 3d October 1789. Yesterday morning we had a frost by which a very considerable part of the growing tobacco twenty miles from the rivers was killed then the Mercury was at 35 to a northern exposure in the open air; this morning it stood at 27 and every tender vegetable in the gardens here is destoryed.  ID388,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,09,07,inform,From some late communications it is evident that as much sugar may be made on the new lands in the States of New-York and Pennsylvania as will supply the whole United States and perhaps in a little time furnish an article of exportation. The profits of the manufactory of sugar when made by private families will be greater than when made by large works. A boiler which will cost only 16s. will be the whole expence that will be necessary to carry on this business and the sugar may be made at a season of the year when no work can be done upon a farm. The price of it when sent to Philadelphia will be twice as high as the same quantity of wheat. The sugar trees may be made to yield their juice without being injured and when they decay fresh ones may easily be cultivated in the soil upon which they now grow. When we consider the value of sugar its general and wholesome use in diet and above all that it has hitherto been obtained at the price of the lives and liberty of our African brethren we cannot help congratulating our fellow citizens upon the prospect of manufactories of that article being established among us whereby immense sums of money will be saved to our country and what is more our country freed from the guilt of encouraging the detestable traffic in human creatures. Several hundred sugar-kettles we hear are now making in New Jersey for the use of the the New England settlers of the Susquehannahand Delaware.  ID391,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,09,23,inform,???annah of New York arrived here on Thursday with a cargo of staves ???e of six weeks. ???re received here from New York per ???atest crops this year of corn and flax [rem]embered for years past; that there ??? demand at the American market for ??? and that trade in general was very ???ishing.
