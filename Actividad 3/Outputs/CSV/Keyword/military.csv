The French General after the and endeavoured to bring over a part of the military to his side against the people : He began with subalterns several of whom took a certain oath of attachment which he administered to them ; but when he came to the Major that officer declined saying he had already engaged himself on the side of the people. Incensed at this reply he reviled him in very opprobrious terms and at last laid his cane upon him ! Frustrated in his attempts upon the infantry he made his next application to the regiment of artillery but with as little success. They informed him that themselves and Culverins were stationed there for the protection of the people and for them only should be used. Driven to the last shift his distress suggested the sorry expedient of having recourse to the people of colour who here form a considerable corps. By a small dose of flattery these people so readily to be caught by a little seeming attention promised to stand by him ; and did so as long as they usually stand firm to any thing–that is till their fears for their own persons became an object of more weighty concern–they then abandoned him. The humiliating familiarities to which he descended to this motley rabble were truly disgusting. He embraced them; called them his enfans and cher amis and practised all the dirty condescensions which those only who are conversant in the praise-worthy art of cajoling can form any conception of. The effect of this conduct was as might be expected insolence–one of this banditti presumed to strike a grenadier–this incensed both the military and the peopl–the consequence was their doughty leader was laid hold of when his trusty defenders left him to his fate. He wa sput into confinement and had the pleasure of beholding from the windows of his prison him whom he had inspired with the insolent temerity to strike White suspended on a gibbet. The inhabitants of St. Pierre then assembled to confer on the measures to be taken on this occasion when ten deputies were chosen to bring the deposed Commander to that part of the island for trial and twelve Judges were chosen to preside at that very important tribunal. Thus stood matters on Thursday last at which time a rumour prevailed that the Marquis de Bouillee had suffered death by the extraordinary and ingenious method of being put between two planks and severed in pieces by a cross-cut saw.  ID76,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,22,entertain,On Tuesday afternoon the six Cherokee Chiefs visited the Cathedral of St. Paul's which they explain with an equal degree of curiosity and amazement. They were asked whether they would not attend the evening service which they readily complied and seemed particularly delighted with the organ. The Cherokee Chiefs having made us an offer of 20000 men gratitude obliges us to make them some acknowledgement whether we accept their offer or not.–We can very well spare them the members of the Halter Club–all our housebreakers highwaymen pick pockets swindlers Faro and E O Table keepers–and all their accomplices to an amazing number. Such a collection would be a truly valuable present.–Among them are found dispersedly all the qualities of able Generals–skilful Financiers –able Negotiators active Citizens–and men highly expert at a Coup de Main. Were we to add the Pugilistic tribe–the Cherokee Chiefs might on their return to their own country enter into a boxing war against their enemies–with a certainty of the most brilliant success. Trading Justices and Lawyers they would perhaps be glad to have ; and it is the opinion of most people that a few thousands of the latter description of men might be spared.  ID104,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,08,29,inform,Montreal July 4 This city has been for a few days past in a state of agitation occasioned by an event which has taken place at Pointe Claire ; and as this matter will be clothed no doubt in all the dress of misrepresentatation by our neighbouring enemies from the information they may receive of it we consider it a duty we owe to the community at large in this country to state the circumstances as they occurred in a fair open and candid manner. By the late militia law 2000 young men are to be drafted from the general militia of the province for three months to be properly trained and of course a certain proportion of this number is to be furnished by each particular district. Some those drafted from the Parish of Pointe Claire refused to march to Lapraire for the purpose of joining the division stationed there ; in consequence of which Major Leprohon belonging to this particular battalion was sent on Tuesday last with 22 attendants to apprehend these refractory persons as deserters. They apprehended four with some opposition ; and on their way to town with them they were followed by a considerable number of persons who rescued one prisoner and threatened that they would next day proceed to the depot at Lapraire and bring away by force from thence the young men of the parish who were there on duty. Accordingly on Wednesday a large body of these people assembled at La Chine with the intention of carrying their threats into execution. Thomas M'Cord Esq. one of the Police Magistrates about four o'clock in the afternoon left town accompanied by the light infantry of the 49th regiment and a detachment of the royal artillery with two field-pieces under the command of Major Plenderleath and took post on a point opposite to the insurgents (consisting of about 400 persons 87 of whom appeared to be armed) and at the distance[?] of about two acres. Mr M'Cord with some other respectable citizens pointed out the impropriety of their conduct and the fate that would unfortunately await their perseverance ; urging them by every persuasion to disperse and return peaceably to their horses and obey the law. They replied that they did not consider the militia bill as fully passed–that they were informed it had not received the Royal sanction ; and that although it might have passed the House of Assembly where it originated it had not obtained the approbation of the other branches of the Legislate ; that the law if really enacted had not been promagated amongst them and that they were not properly made acquainted with it ; as such they could not pay obedience to it. Under this false and unfortunate impression these deluded people persisted ; but at the same time declared with shouts of Vive le Roi that if the Government wanted their services at any time they were ready one and all to come forward with their lives in the defence of their country and that they would prove themselves in the hour of danger to be faithful subjects to a Government to which they were firmly attached by every principle. Finding however that they still persisted in their determination on this particular object Mr M'Cord in his Magisterial capacity read the riot act to them and ordered them to disperse ; which not being complied with a round shot was fired by the artillery but elevated above injury which was returned by the insurgents in a spirited fire with ball deserving of a better cause. The troops then fired a volley with ball and grape but still too much elevated to do any harm which was also returned by another discharge from the mob upon which a few direct shots were fired at them (it being nearly dark) by the military which made them disperse and one man was found killed and another wounded it is feared mortally.  ID105,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,10,03,inform,Upper Canada York July 28. Yesterday at an early hour his Honour Isaac Brock Esq. administering the Government of Upper Canada and Major-General commanding his Majesty's forces therein arrived at this place from Fort-George and accompanied by a numerous suite proceeded to the Government Building at four p.m. when he opened the present extra session of the Legislature and delivered the following speech to both houses :– Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislature Council and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly The urgency of the present crisis is the only consideration which would have induced me to call you together at a time when public as well as private duties elsewhere demand your care and attention. But Gentlemen when invaded by an enemy whose avowed object is the entire conquest of this province the voice of loyalty as well as of interest calls aloud to every person in the sphere in which he is placed to defend his country. Our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it ; they have evinced by the promptitude and loyalty of their conduct that they are worthy of the King whom they serve and of the constitution which they enjoy ; and it affords me particular satisfaction that while I address you as Legislators I speak to mean who in the day of danger will be ready to assist not only with their counsels but with their arms. We look Gentlemen to our militia as well as to the regular forces for our protection ; but I should be wanting to that important trust committed to my care if I attempted to conceal (what experience the great instructor of mankind especially of legislators has discovered) that amendment in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient. It is for you to consider what further improvements they still may require. Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly From the history and experience of our mother country we learn that in times of actual invasion or internal commotion the ordinary course of criminal laws has been found in adequate to secure his Majesty's Government from private treachery as well as from open disaffection ; and that at such times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws restraining for a limited period the liberty of individuals in many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the particulars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion of the province might justify me in the exercise of the full power reposed in me on such an emergency yet it will be more agreeable to me to receive the sanction of the Houses. A few traitors have already joined the enemy–have been suffered to come into the country with impunity–and have been harboured and concealed in the interior ; yet the general spirit of loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of this province is such as to authorise a just expectation that their efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing– The disaffected I am convinced are few–To protect and defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations is an object worthy of your most serious deliberations. The speech concludes with a call for supplies. Proclamation The unprovoked declaration of war by the United States of America against the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and its dependencies has been followed by the actual invasion of this province in a remote frontier of the western districts by a detachment of the United States. The officer commanding that detachment has thought proper to invite his Majesty's subjects not merely to a quiet and unresisting submission but insults them with a call to seek voluntarily the protection of his Government. Without condescending to repeat the illiberal epithets bestowed in this appeal of the American Commander to the people of Upper Canada on the administration of his Majesty every inhabitant of the province is desired to seek the confutation of such indecent slander in the review of his own particular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian subject who can truly affirm to himself that he has been injured by the Government in his person his property or his liberty? Where is to be found in any part of the world a growth so paid in prosperity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled not thirty years by a band of veterans exiled from their former possessions on account of their loyalty not a descendant of these brave people it to be found who under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment superior to what were possessed by their ancestors. This unequalled prosperity would not have been attained by the utmost liberality of the Government or the persevering industry of the people had not the maritime power of the mother country secured to its colonists a safe access to every market where the produce of their labour was in request. The unavoidable and immediate consequence of a separation from Great Britain must be the loss of this inestimable advantage and what is offered to you in exchange? To become a territory of the United States and share with them that exclusion from the ocean which the policy of their Government enforces ; you are not even flattered with a participation of their boasted independence ; and it is but too obvious that once exchanged from the powerful protection of the United Kingdom you must be re-annexed to the dominion of France from which the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms of Great Britain at vast expence of blood and treasure from no other motive than to relieve her ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire of France was the stipulated reward for the aid afforded to the revolted colonies now the United States ; the debt is still due and there can be no doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consideration for commercial advantages or rather for an expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over the commercial world. Are you prepared inhabitants of Canada to become willing subjects or rather slaves to the despot who rules the nation of Europe with a rod of iron? If not arise in a body exert your energies co-operate cordially with the King's regular forces to repel the invader and do not give cause to your children when groaning under the oppression of a foreign master to reproach you with having too easily parted with the richest inheritance of this earth–a participation in the name character and freedom of Britain. [The proclamation concludes with a declaration that should the Americans refused quarter in consequence of Indians being found in Canadian ranks that a severe and rigorous retaliation will take place.] Isaac Brock Major-Gen. and President Head-quarters Fort George July 22 1812.  ID106,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,10,03,inform,Quebec Papers Provincial Parliament of Lower Canada Legislative Council –Aug 1. This day at two o'clock his Excellency the Governor in Chief went in the usual state to the Legislative Council Chamber and being seated on the Throne the Gentlemen Usher of the Black Rod was sent to command the presence of the Assembly which being come up the Honourable Speaker of the Assembly said– May it please your Excellency His Majesty's faithful subjects the representatives of the province of Lower Canada have passed a bill intituled An Act of facilitate the Circulation of Army Bills. Their loyalty and the happiness of this province in being connected with and powerfully protected by the British nation are the basis of their constitution and the just grounds which gave rise to the formation of the militia and the firm determination to defend this country against the unexpected and unjust war that the United States have lately declared ; they are therefore under the greatest obligation to your Excellency for having communicated to them your wise precautions on the means to ameliorate and insure for several years the punctual payment of the army by circulating bills the reimbursement of which is guaranteed in England. To give them greater credit the bill limits the sums necessary and moreover provides for the interest the advantages accruing therefrom and even for the payment of the principal in specie in this province which has become expressly bound for the same at a fixed period to any person whatever who from the state of his private affairs would prefer such payment. In full confidence that under the present and any unforeseen circumstance your Excellency is invested with all necessary authority the representatives of the province and their constituents rely on the wisdom already experienced of your administration and in the name of the Commons of Lower Canada I have the honour to present this bill to your Excellency humbly requesting thereto his Majesty's assent. His Excellency was pleased to signify the Royal assent. His Excellency then addressed both Houses and the Provincial Parliament was prorogued to the 16th of September.  ID109,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1813,10,07,inform,(From the Quebec Mercury.) Attack on Fort Schlosser. Head-quarters Kingston July 13. By accounts from the army under Major-General De Rottenburg dated the 9th instant the following particulars have been received of a bold and successful attempt to surprise the American post at Fort Schlosser. In the night of the 4th instant a party consisting of Volunteer Thompson and six privates of the 49th regiment under Ensign Winder and thirty-four of the militia the whole under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Clarke of the Lincoln militia crossed over in boats from Chippawa to Fort Schlosser which they reached a little before day-break and completely surprised the guard consisting of two Lieutenants one serjeant and eight privates whom they made prisoners together with three civilians and three of our own subjects found in the Fort.– The party remained in the Fort about one hour loading their boats form the public stores and wharf and brought with them one brass six-pounder 57 stand of arms two and a half kegs of musket ball cartridges 6 bulwarks of musket proof curtains for boats one gun-boat two batteaux 20 barrels of salt 17 casks tobacco eight barrels of pork and one barrel of whiskey with a number of spades oars and axes ; a small party of the enemy had collected as the last boast pushed off from the shore and several shots were fired but the boats returned to Chippawa with their prisoners and the articles they had captured without a man being hurt on this service. Further accounts have also been received from the army highly creditable to the Indian warriors serving with it. On the 8th instant a party of the King's regiment and a body of Indian warriors were sent to endeavour to recover a considerable quantity of medicines and surgical instruments which had been buried near the Fort George when our troops retired from it. A skirmish ensued in consequence between the Indians and the enemy in which the latter lost one officer and 20 men killed and 10 taken prisoners–the whole of the medicines and instruments were brought off by the party of the King's; the only loss sustained being three Indians wounded. Captain Norton led the Indian warriors with great spirit ; and much credit is due to Captain Merrit of the Provincial dragoons for reconnoitering the spot where the medicines were deposited and conducting the party to it. A few nights ago the barracks at Gravelly Point burnt by our gun-boats and more than 100 barrels of pork flour and other articles brought away from thence together with a very fine Durham boat–500 oars colleced and partly loaded in her for Sacket's Harbour being destroyed. Attack on Black Rock Head-quarters Kingston July 15 1813. G. O.–His Excellency the Commander of the forces has received a dispatch from Major General De Rottenburg reporting a successful attack upon the enemy's post and dockyard at Black Rock at daybreak on the morning of the 11th inst. by detachments of the King's and 41st regiments together with Liutenant Fitzgibbon's party of the 49th and about 40 militia the whole amounting to 240 men under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp. The enemy's position was carried by a spirited attack without the loss of a single man. Several large boats loaded with stores and provisions and three field pieces a twelve and two six-pounders were brought away ; a vessel and all the naval store-houses and barracks have been burnt. Unfortunately before the evacuation of the post was completed a strong reinforcement of the enemy aided by Indians pressed this small detachment by which Captain Saunders of the 41st and 15 men were killed ; Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp Lieutenant Montpesson of the 41st and 15 rank and file wound ed. The wounded were brought over. Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp has received three wounds severe but not considered dangerous. By his Excellency's command Edward Baynes Adjutant-General British Expedition to Plattsburgh The following is an extract of a letter from a respectable citizen at Burlington dated Aug. 1. 1813 An express arrived at Burlington on the 30th July with intelligence that the British had left the Isle au Noix with a force consisting of the two armed sloops of 11 guns each and four gallies of one gun each and 100 batteaux full of men and had progressed within one mile of the town. The camp was instantly alarmed and the troops under arms but no enemy appeared. Next day we learnt that about 1000 troops under the command of Colonel Murray had landed and took possession of Plattsburgh without opposition there being no force to oppose them except the militia of the town and vicinity who being only 400 in number retreated as the enemy advanced. The arsenal belonging to the State Pike's encampment barracks at Serenac cantonment and every building belonging to the United States were immediately burnt. The enemy obtained both provisions and stores. The loss cannot be less than 50000 dollars. The enemy left Plattsburgh on the 1st and are understood to be proceeding this way ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? On General Dearborn invading Canada and taking possession of Fort George he sent off to Greenbush as prisoners of war the following respectable inhabitants : Messrs Edwards Murehead Dickson Lyminston Lawe two Kerrs M'Ewan Parson Addison Howell Heron Green Baldwin Clinch Jones Ball Decoe and John Crook. Messrs Lawe M'Ewen and the two Kerrs were wounded on the 27th June. General Dearborn expected that the inhabitants would have joined the Americans. General Dearborn resigned the command of the Niagara army on the 23th June on account of indisposition. General Lewis says in his dispatch to Secretary at War that he did not think the General would ever again be fit for service ; that the unfortunate events of the war had deranged his understanding ; and that thought sometimes in a state of convalescence he uniformly relapsed when military topics were alluded to. General Lewis having been nominated to command at Sacket's Harbour is succeeded at Fort George Niagara and on the Canadian frontier by General Boyd. The Indian chief Tecumseh has seized the favourable moment of the diversion by our shipping in Virginia for surround Fort Meigs with 2000 warriors. He had deprived the garrison of all the possibility of receiving supplies. General Clay who commanded there had written urgently to General Harrison for assistance. The latter was collecting his army to march to his relief. Sir James Yeo after the retreat of the enemy's army at Fort George swept the American side of Lake Ontario. He landed a body of troops at Great Sodus and took the whole of the provisions consisting of several hundred barrels of pork and flour and burnt the buildings. The British loss was a serjeant and four privates of the Royal killed. At Genessee River he inflicted the same loss on the enemy taking 500 barrels of pork and 1700 bushels of corn. The provisions were delivered to General Vincent. Four companies of the Royals were embarked on board the fleet to serve as mariners There were at Quebec on the 22d July 1000 American prisoners of war captured since the commencement of the campaign. At Beaufort there were 50 officers including three General. In consequence of the conduct of the American Government and of the officers the latter are no longer permitted to return home on parole. The Melpomene frigate with De Meuron's regiment from the Mediterranean arrived in the river St. Lawrence on the 20th July. James Gready private in the 8th or King's regiment and Terence Hunt private in the 6th foot were in the latter end of June tried by Court Martials for deserting to the enemy and being found in arms and were publicy shot at Kingston Canada pursuant to their sentence. It appears from the Quebec papers and from the general orders issued by the Commander in Chief in Canada that on the late defeat of General Wilkinson on the banks of the Miami river the American military chest containing 15000l. Sterling was among the property captured by the British. Captain Waugh of the 103d regiment died at Chamely on the 2d July. General Hampton has arrested Colonel Clark the late commandant at Burlington for a defalcation of about 50000 dollars.  ID113,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1814,09,12,inform,[Extracts of Letters from Quebec and Montreal.] Quebec July 15. The commercial world is flourishing here but in political matters I am sorry to say we are sadly in the back ground. The old defensive system is still adhered to and I fear much with all our reinforcements we shall do little good till we have another commander in chief. There is now a great body of regular troops in this country and a handful of brave fellows have recently been almost sacrificed par la petite guerre at Chippawa whilst in the lower province there are at least 10000 regulars doing nothing. Some of the officers of the regiments lately arrived from France do not conceal their sentiments– On inspecting one of the regiments the other day our chief took occasion as usual to make some remarks on the cut of the men's clothes when the Colonel commanding stepped forward and told him plainly that such systems were now completely exploded–that he had had the honour of serving very lately under a much more celebrated General that it was probable he would ever serve under again–that his men had been accustomed to fight not to dance ; and if such was the plan he was called on to follow he should certainly retire from the service. Such language you may suppose was not very pleasing to our Governor ; but I am happy to find that we now have military men amongst us who are not afraid to speak out ; as it appears the numberless representations of civilians are not much attended to. Montreal July 14. I consider this country now as perfectly secure against any attempts that the Americans may make not withstanding the system of our chief does not seem to be changed. He has received a great many more troops this year than he had any idea of and does not seem pleased at having so large a force unhis command as the country will now look to him for some offensive operation against the enemy. He has done nothing the whole summer but parade about 6000 men at Chambly where he makes them march past him twice a-week bowing and scraping instead of employing them where they ought to be. You will have heard of an American army of about 6000 under General Jacob Brown having crossed the river at Fort Erie when General Rial with a force of 1500 only gallantly assailed them but was overpowered by numbers and sustained considerable loss. I inclose a general order published yesterday about this unfortunate business whereby you will find that our loss has been great. Upon this frontier the Americans have hardly any force and it appears very singular indeed that so great a body of men as are now on the other side of the river from Sorel to Isle Aux Noix at least 10000 men should be left for the purpose of parade when they are so much wanted in the upper province. I sincerely hope that some investigation will take place into this business as it is really disgraceful to think that such an enemy should be able to make an attack upon us with impunity.  ID114,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1814,10,15,inform,Quebec Sept. 10. The Americans to the number of 900 men landed and at tacked Fort Michillimackinac in Lake Huron on the 4th August. They were repulsed by the British garrison. The American fort la Prairie du Chiens has been taken by the British. This place was considered as of great importance to the enemy. Major General Conran of the Royal has had the misfortune to break his leg by a fall from his horse. This officer had just arrived to join the army on the Niagara frontier when he met with this accident. On the 31st August the British troops broke their encampment at Odell Town near Lake Champlain and proceeded immediately to take possession of the position which the American army had just abandoned at the village of Champlain. This army was commanded by General Izard and are said to have proceeded partly to Plattsburgh and partly to Sackett's Harbour on Lake Ontario. The British troops now at Champlain are commanded by Major Gene rals Brisbane Power and Robinson and consist of the 13th 49 88th Meuron's regiment Canadian chasseurs &c. &c. The 79th[?] or [?] Glasgow Lowland regiment are now quartered at Cornwall in Upper Canada. The 4th[?] battalion of the 1st or Royal Scots are stationed at Quebec. The 3rd[?] 104th flank[?] companies 103d 8th or King's 100th regiment de Watteville [?] battalion of 1st or Royal Scots and 41st flank[?] companies are with the army under Lieutenant General Drummon on the Niagara frontier Upper Canada. The 37th and 57th regiments are at Montreal. On the 15th of August the British troops under Lieutenant General Drummond assaulted Fort Erie. The attack was made in three columns under Colonel Scott of the 103d regiment Lieutenant Colonel Drummond 104th regiment and Lieutenant Colonel Fischer of de Watteville's. The two former were directed to scale the fort and the latter to get possession of a small hill named Snake-Hill which the Americans had fortified and being situated only about eight hundred yards from Fort Erie was of consequence to us. This latter column failed in their object ; but the two columns destined for the fort carried the same in a most gallant manner and obliged the enemy to retire into two stone block-houses inside the fort when their own guns were turned against them. At this time a most unfortunate explosion took place which blew up the magazine and battery and with them a number of our brave soldiers ; and the consternation caused by this was so great and we were obliged to abandon our conquest and retreat to our original position with great loss of both officers and men. The large ship-building by the British at Kingston on Lake Ontario is to be launched the second week in September– also will carry about 100 guns. The battalion of royal marines commanded by LieutenantColonel Williams and which has been stationed lately at Isle au Noix and parts adjacent have been broken up and distributed among the fleets on the Lakes. The Staff of the battalion proceed immediately to Halifax from Quebec in the Ceylong armed-en [?] ship. The Junon frigate Captain Upton has arrived from Halifax at Quebec with money for Government. The crew of this vessel is to be employed on the Lakes. A brig which sailed from Cork under convoy of the Antelope of 50 guns has arrived at Quebec.–The Antelope and the ships under convoy are hourly expected. It is said that there are on board the ships of the latter about 4000 troops chiefly detachments and reinforcements for the regimentsin Canada. Captain Dowale of the royal navy now commands the fleet on Lake Champlain.  ID116,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1814,12,08,inform,Canada Papers Montreal Oct. 29 The express from Upper Canada which arrived yesterday morning confirmed the highly satisfactory reports of the preceding day that the enemy had precipitately retreated on the 19th instant from before Chippawa after destroying a quantity of provisions and heavy baggage ; and that on the 21st they had passed over to Buffaloe a great part of their force and were blowing up the works at Fort Erie. Further accounts from Kingston have been received this morning to the 26th instant when the official report of the enemy's retreat from Fort Erie after the destruction of the works had not reached that place but there was no doubt of the fact. Major-Genera de Watteville commanded the corps pressing on the enemy ; the master of a mail which arrived at Kingston on the 25th in twenty-four hours from Fort George further confirms the previous intelligence and reports that several hundred prisoners were taken before the Americans effected their escape across the river. On the 18th the British came up with his rear guard and in a sharp action thirty of the Americans were left on the field wihtout a casualty happening on our side. This was at Chippawa Creek.– The enemy then fled with the utmost precipitation to Fort Erie and began the destruction of his fortifications. A military courier from Kingston arrived this morning brings no additional news of importance.– Sir James Yeo had returned to Kingston with the sick of the army of Niagara on board. We again sailed for the head of the Lake. A private letter from Niagara of the 10th instant says that a severe action took place the day before near Chippawa ; our loss is stated at 10 killed and wounded. That of the enemy is supposed to be very considerable ; a field piece made to bear upon one of his columns did great execution. Another letter denies any loss in killed but makes the wounded 25 or 30. Montreal Nov. 5. From Upper Canada we have received nothing of importance. The report of the whole American armies have crossed the Niagara was a mistake as the last accounts from that quarter mention that General Brown was still in possession of Fort Erie. Quebec Nov. 3. We are in expectation of some further details of the operations on the Niagara frontier by this day's Montreal post ; but they had no arrived at one o'clock. The evacuation by the enemy of our territory on that frontier is a striking illustration of the importance of the command of the lake. The enemy did cross over to our side till the moment his fleet was ready to assume the superiority. The re-appearance of our fleet effected what could not be done by the expence of so much blood and treasure. (From the Quebec Gazette) The American Government has published the pa pers relating to the late negotations at Ghent. We confess that we have seen these papers with feelings of some satisfaction and much regret ; satisfaction that we can now say that the honour of the British Government is pledged to do something for British interests in North American and regret that that something is so little. The Indians are to be made independent of both nations. This is perfectly just and would under certain cirumstances greatly add to the security of these provinces. The Lakes are to be exclusively British. On these subjects we must be permitted to ask how long they would be permitted to remain so how long the Indians would retain their independence in the event of another war if the communication with them should be in the power of the enemy ? The sole communication for military purposes with the Indians and the Lakes is by the river St Lawrence from Montreal to Kingston and from Niagara to Fort Erie ; and the Americans are to be permitted to remain in possession of one of its banks ! The enemy has hitherto been prevented from interrupting this communication by the thinness of the settlements of their side the consequent badness of the roads and difficulty of supplying a large force. The possession of th southern bank of the St Lawrence between Montreal and Kingson and the power of supplying themselves and operating on that frontier by the roads now existing and from Lake Champlain has been worth a large force to them during the whole of the war ; it has caused us to parcel our force to support the line of communication between Lake St Francis and Kingston and keep a great proportion of it to protect the base of that line in the vicinity of Montreal. The position of Canada relative to the United States with its present boundaries is an extraordinary one ; so much so that intelligent military men have pronounced it incapable of defence much beyond Quebec. The miserable state of the enemy's preparations the superiority which we then had on the Lakes the good disposition of the inhabitants and the prudent conduct of the commander of the forces alone saved it. The waste of means in protecting and conveying supplies by a communication of five hundred miles adjoining the whole way to the enemy's frontie is conceivable only to those whom experience has made acquainted with the fact or who are habituated to reflection ; and whenever the communication of the Lakes becomes interrupted the supply of any force further advanced on the line becomes utterly impracticable. The enemy derives his supplies either by the Lakes upon which an army can effect nothing or from a settled country a long way in his rear protected by his army a country covered with woods and a militia more effective than the best troops in such a country always ready for the protection of their property and their houses– Under such circumstances the weakness of an army beyond a certain point is to be counted by its numbers. We scruple not to say that whenever that part of the State of New York extending to the St Lawrence between Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain shall be fully settled the whole of Upper Canada must fall to the United States the Lower Canada will not be defensible but at an expence of means far beyond its value. We had much rather see the Americans confirmed in the possession of Sackett's Harbour Presqu-ile Detroit and Michilimackinac than in the possession of the tract of country just mentioned. Great Britain will always have the means of establishing a superiority on the Lakes whenever she chuses to exert them but she never will be able to drive the Americans out of that frontier when once fully settled supported as they will be by the immense population of the back parts of the State of New York and adjoining States. From the United States Papers Urbanna Sept. 25. An express has arrived from Detroit to General M'Arthur in six days in which Governor Cass says– A state of things has arrived in which your presence with the force at your disposal is essential to the security and preservation of the country. The Indians have recommenced hostilities on every side of us ; they are murdering the people and breaking up the settlements. There is now a large force of them in the immediate vicinity of this place most probably within a mile of it with the avowed purpose of attacking the town. We have no force adequate to the defence of the country and none of description proper for the pursuit of the Indians– My opinion is that you should hasten on with the mounted men with all possible expedition. The express came by water the land communiation being entirely cut off. Albany Oct. 25. The Legislature of this State adjourned yesterday after a session of four weeks. The principal laws passed are: An act to authorise the raising of troops for the defence of this State. An act to encourage privateering. An act to authorise the raising of a corps of sea fencibles. An act to provide for the repayment of certain sums of money advanced by the Corporation of the city of New York for the defence of the State and for other purposes. An act to prevent the apprehension of British deserters. An act to authorise the raising of two regiments of men of colour. An act authorising additional pay to be made to the volunteers and for paying the militia called into service by the State authority. An act to aid in the apprehension of deserters from the army and navy of the United States. The first act authorises the Governor to call into actual service 12000 men for the term of two years provided the Government of the United States shall have declared their intention to pay clothe and subsist them at their expence. The privateer bill authorises associations to incorporate themselves for the purpose of fitting out privateers. The following resolution introduced by Mr Monell passed both Houses of our Legislature unanimously on Saturday:– Resolved unanimously–That the House of Assembly of the State of New York view with mingled emotions of surprise and indignation the extravagant and disgraceful terms proposed by the British Commissioners at Ghent–that however ardently they may desire the restoration of peace to their country they can never consent to receive it at the sacrifice of national honour and dignity–that they therefore strongly recommend to the National Legislature the adoption of the vigorous and efficacious measures in the prosecution of the war as the best means of the bringing the contest to an honourable termination and of transmitting unimpaired to their posterity their rights liberty and independence. The following is a private letter which was brought by the Liffey : Montreal Nov. 5. 1814. Sir George Prevost reached Kingston on the 10th October where his presence has been of the utmost importance. Chauncey resigned his blockade of that place on the 8th and retired with his squadron to Sackett's Harbour. Our fleet which was ready for the Lake in a few days after Sir George's arrival sailed for Niagara on the 16th with 500 of the 90th and a supply of provisions and stores for the right division and arrived off Fort George on the evening of the 18th. Having landed this reinforce ment Sir James returned to Kingston on the 24th. The enemy at Fort Erie having been joined by General Izard's army making a force of 7 or 8000 men advanced upon General Drummond and attacked our positions upon the Chippawa on the 15th instant ; but having met with an opposition unexpected by them and making no impression retired on the 16th and 17th to Black Creek from whence they advanced one of Izard's brigades 1500 men on the 19th with a view of our turning our right and attempted to cross the Chippawa about six miles from its mouth where they were met with by a corps of about 1000 troops under Colonel Meyers who faced them most manfully ; they skirmished the whole day in which the Glengarries supported their high character and in the evening Jonathan finding himself foiled and unable to bring up his artillery from the horrid state of the roads retired again to the main body at Black Creek. Our casualties on this occasion were triflin– those of the enemy were said to have been considerable though he refrained from exposing himself to our fire in the open ground. We had two field-pieces there and whenever the enemy showed a column out of the wood a well-directed discharge soon obliged them to return to their shelter. By this time our fleet being announced gave alarm to the enemy and they commenced a precipitate retreat to Fort Erie. They were purused on the 20th and 21st by our advance under Major-General Watteville close to Fort Erie where he found them occupying the high ground which General Drummond had not left many weeks before and could push no further. At the date of the last accounts from General Drummond Jonathan still maintained his post from which it will require a few columns of fresh troops to dislodge him but as they are now on their way to join the right dividion I trust I shall in a short time have the pleasure to acquaint you of the complete expulsion of the enemy from the Niagara frontier. It is said that for want of sufficient shelter a part of General Izard's force had crossed to Buffalo and that they had passed over some heavy artillery and stores leaving at the fort such a force as they conceived capable of defending it. Sir James brough down with him the skeleton of the 1st battalion of the King's regiment and the remains of the two flank companies of the 10th. He sailed again on the 1st inst. taking with him about 1200 men comprising the 37th a brigade of artillery a 9pounder and detachments from the 6th and 82d regiments and a large supply of provisions and stores. The five hundred of the 9th regiment who marched to York would be crossed to Niagara in the brigs ; the 9th 850 strong were to have been embarked in the fleet but Sir James could not take them. The Royals 41st 89th and 100th exhausted corps return to Kingston by this trip of the fleet which I fear was scarcely able to make another this season. The St Lawrence has proved a noble ship and one and all seem delighted with her. The frigate in frame arrived at Kingston where she has been laid down and lengthened to make her the size of the Prince Regent. The keel of a 74 is also laid down there. The Americans are said to have commenced upon two more ships of the class of the Superior. Letters from Michilimacinack to the 19th October state that the capture of the two schooners will be attended with the most important benefits in the security of that post and the territory dependent upon it. Captain Rocheblave with the detachment of the 81st under Capt. Wardrop and artillery arrived there on the 14th October without any casualty among the troops ; and Mr M'Kenzie with his brigade would arrive about the 21st. The two schooners had made a trip to Nottawasage for provisions and supplies and would attempt another before the navigation closed. A reinforcement had been sent under Capt Bulgar to Praire du Chain. The arrangements necessary for reinforcing and supplying General Drummond's army being completed and the attack upon Sackett's Harbour being deemed impracticable this season Sir George returned last evening to this place ; his journey to Kingston has certainly had the effect of inducing General Brown with a considerable part of his force to move to Sackett's Harbour and has thus left General Izard so much weakened at Fort Erie that I have little doubt of the result of an attack upon him. I am sorry to see that the malice of a certain party here has been at work at your side of the water ; it has increased tenfold since the expression of the public sentiment in favour of his Excellency by the addresses which are now preparing and which I can assure you is the real and unsolicited voice of the people. I am happy to find that General Kempt is going to England as he will afford true information upon the state of the country and be able to exposethe falsehoods which have been circulated respecting recent events.  ID119,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1816,11,21,inform,Canada Papers. Montreal Oct. 5. On the afternoon of Saturday last the specie seized on board the Lake Champlain steam-boat amounting to upward of 12000 dollars arrived at his Majesty's cash-office here under the escort of the 19th light dragoons from St John's. At length we have authentic accounts relating to the expedition of Lord Selkirk ; they are very important as many ex parte details have been published - his taking Fort William by storm making all the partners of the North West Company prisoners &c. ; but the cause of the expe dition has never been explained. The Canadian Courant puts it in a very clear point of view:– Mr Robert Semple the Governor-General The Hudson's Bay Company on the Red River towards the close of the year 1815 took possession of two establishments belonging to the North West Company which had obtruded themselves on the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company. The North West traders then altered their route going into the Upper Country by circuitous ways by which much delay took place ; and in order to try Mr Semple they sent two cartloads of provisions by the former track in June last with a guard of fifty men ; the advance twenty-two of the number fell in with one of the natives whom they took forward with them to prevent discovery. The rear-guard passed within four miles of the settlement ; they were perceived by the Governor and were attacked by a party from the garrison consisting of about thirty soldiers ; an engagement took place stated on the 19th of June. Mr Semple and 21 of his men were killed ; the rest of his forces returned defeated to the fort ; it is on this account that the expedition of Lord Selkirk was undertaken. The manner of Lord Selkirk's conducting the expedition we do not justify nor indeed can we form any opinion on the subject without further authentic details ; it is however but justice to say that the Hudson's Bay Company have rights and are a chartered Company ; the North West Traders though we believe a most respectable body are only an Association of Merchants.  ID120,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1816,12,16,inform,Canada Lord Selkirk We have been favoured by a Gentleman in this city with the following interesting and authentic communication on the subject of the dispute between Lord Selkirk and the Gentlemen of the North West Company: Extract of a Letter from Montreal dated 6th October 1816. In the newspapers which I sent you you will see some accounts of the disturbances which have taken place in the North West between the North West Company and Lord Selkirk's colonists. The latter have been obliged to leave the Red River after having had 22 of their men including Governor Semple killed by a party of half-breeds the spurious offspring of the North West Company. As yet have not had an accurate statement of that melancholy transaction. Lord Selkirk's party state that these half-breed with some of the North West Com pany servants came to destroy the settlement and that Mr Semple with about 25 of the Colonists went out to meet them to know what could be their intentions when those rascals commenced firing on them and massacred all but three who were fortunate enough to make their escape. The North West people's account is that these half-breeds with some Indians were bringing down provisions from the upper part of the Red River to the entrance near Lake Winipie and as the Colonists had the command of a great part of the river they were obliged to pass in the rear of the settlement which being observed by Governor Semple who was on the look-out for them he settled out of his Fort with 25 men and a [?]-piece to take from the Indians the provisions which were intended for the North West Company ; that the result[?] was an engagement which terminated in the defeat of the Colonists of whom twenty-two were killed. Lord Selkirk [?] from Montreal for the Red River about the latter end of June when[?] three or four officers and about 150 men of De Men[?]'s regiment which had been disbanded and when he arrived at Fort William on Lake Superior hearing the fate of his Colonists he[?] immediately issued a warrant against Mr M'Gillivray for high treason conspiracy and murder and subsequently warrants against all the partners of the N. W. Company who were at F William [?] formal possession of their establishment there and sent Mr M'Gillivray with about ten others prisoners to Montreal with all their papers [?] a number of packs of Beaver and other Furs and several bales[?] of Merchandise which he found in possession of the North West Company belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company. The Police Officers in Montreal were several days examining the papers and about four or five days after the arrival of Mr M'Gillivray and the others they were admitted to bail to appear to take their trial at the next criminal court or any court of Oyer and Terminer which may be appointed. Stuart (the ci-de vant Solicitor-General who was dismissed by Sir James Craig and at whose instance an ineffectual attempt was lately made by some misguided members of our House of Assembly to impeach Chief Justices Sewell and Monk) is one of Lord Selkirk's counsel and spoke at great length and what his friends and admirers call very eloquently strongly opposed their being admitted to bail but all would not do and they were accordingly bailed ; Mr M'Gillivray in sureties of t1000 and the others in t500 sums inconsiderable enough advering to the high crimes and misdemeanours with which they were charged. In the Montreal Herald you will see a very learned and (as our neighbour Jonathan would say) a lengthy communication signed Montius[?] setting forth the rights which the Hudson's Bay Company by their charter possess over the Countries which they have granted to Lord Selkirk and the power vested in him of appointing Governors and other Officers to superintend and regulate the Colony. Being a masterly production it will no doubt makes its appearance in a pamphlet and when it does I shall send you one in case the papers should miscarry. It is uncertain whether the Earl will remain in the North West during the winter or come down to Montreal ; if the latter he must be down[?] soon[?] as the season for water-travelling will shortly close. Montreal is now divided into two parties one favouring the Lord and the other the North West Company ; and with the exception of the friends of the latter strongly in favour of his Lordship.  ID124,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,19,inform,New York and other American papers have been received to the 20th December: – In the house of Representatives on the 9th Mr Johnson brought forward a series of resolutions relative to the military establish the principal of which is the following: – That the military peace establishment of the United States shall consist hereafter of eight thousand men including the corps of invalids. Provided that the corps of engineers the General Staff and Ordnance Department shall be retained as at present established. Provided also that no part of the army shall be disbanded in consequence of said reduction but the same shall be effected by permitting vacancies as they occur to remain – That it is expedient to provide by law for an additional national armoury to be located on the western waters. That it is expedient to organise by law a corps of invalids to be composed of one thousand men. The following resolution relative to foreign seamen was also proposed and adopted without opposition : Resolved. That the Committee of Commerce and Manufactures be instructed to inquire into the expediency of providing by law for the apprehending and securing foreign seamen deserting from foreign vessels while in the ports of the United States contrary to their engagements to serve on board such vessels.  ID127,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,07,16,inform,Canada Papers from Upper Canada contain the draft of a petition to the Prince Regent founded on the resolutions adopted in the province of Niagara where some discontent has been manifested. The first part is as follows:– To his Royal Highness George Prince of Wales Regent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland &c. the humble Address of the Inhabitants of Upper Canada May it please your Royal Highness The subjects of your Royal Father dwelling in Upper Canada should need no words to give assurance of their loyalty if the whole truth had reached the throne of their Sovereign. His subjects have reason to believe that the truth has not been told. During three years of war Upper Canada was exposed to the ravages of a powerful and inveterate foe. The Government of the United States had been long concerting the invasion of this province. Hostile preparations against it had been long masked under other designs ; and at last the accumulated torrent of violence burst on the defencless children of the British empire. Nor were they assailed by the weapons of war alone ; an invidious proclamation preceded those host of the enemy forgetful of honour regardless of humanity and daring to seduce the subjects of Britain from their true allegiance. The subjects of Britain remained dauntless and firm. It was not for their property that they rose against their invaders ; the invader would have spared to them their property. They flew to arms in defence of the rights and sovereignty of Britain. Twice has the American standard been planted in Upper Canada while yet but a handful of British troops aided the native battalions wave the laurel of victory over the protrate intruders on their soil. The second year of war saw Canada contending with yet little assistance from the parent state. The second year of the war saw her sons confirmed in their virtue and still more determined to resist. Wives and children had fled from their homes ; the face of the country was laid waste and the fire of revenge was sent forth to consummate distress and misery ; still was the spirit of the people unextinguished still did it burn with patriotism and loyalty. By the third year every risk of conquest was at an end for now the British aid poured into the provinces and peace was proclaimed when war was no longer to be feared. It is now more than three years since there was an end of war but strange to say these years of peace have manifested no appearance of affection or care from the mother country to the Canadas. Commercial treaties have been made altogether neglectful of British interests here. Government transactions which used to give spirit to trade and are at a stand; troops are withdrawn ; fortifications are suffered to go to ruin ; and rumours are abroad too shocking to be repeated in the Royal ear. May it please your Royal Highness to listen calmly to the complains and grievances of the people of Upper Canada who are fully assured that your Royal Highness has been kept ignorant of most important truths ; who are well assured of the generous disposition of your Royal heart and of your desire that British subjects should every where share equally you paternal regard an affection. It was a matter of much provocation to the people of the province to see even during the war which afforded such striking proofs of their loyalty and valour reports went home highly rating the merits of regular troops while the tribute due to Canadian levies were unfairly set down may the principles of the most loyal subjects here were often stigmatised by British officers ignorant of human character and still more so of circumstances which affect it in this part of the world. It was not so with the immortal Brock. He justly appreciated Canadian worth and his memory will happily long cherish in the minds of the Canadian people a due regard for the genuine spirit of a British solider at once generous and brave. The loyal inhabitants of Upper Canada would disdain to notice the misrepresentations of individuals so contrary to notorious truth if these had not obviously conspired with other causes to lessen the regard which should subsist between British subjects here and at home to influence the conduct of Ministers towards the general interests of the province. The loyal subjects of his Majesty in Upper Canada suffered grievously during the war in their property and many were bereft of their all. A solemn investigation on this subject took place ; the claims of the sufferers were authenticated and there was every reason to expect that recompence would immediately follow ; yet nothing has followed but delay and insult. Surely if there is among mankind a single principle of justice that is one that the individuals of a nation ought not partially to bear the weight of public calamity. Surely individuals who have exposed their lives for Government should not be disgusted with finding Government regardless of those very principles which it is intended to sustain. The people of this province are well aware that their fellow subjects at home are pressed hard with taxations and far it is from their wish that relief should be afford from thence. Canada contains within itself ample means of exonerating Government from the claims of sufferers by war ; and it is within the fiat[?] of your Royal Highness to remove by a signle breath the evil now justly complained of. Millions of acres of fertile lands lie here at the disposal of your Royal Highness upon the credit of which under proper management not only the fair claims of loyal sufferers could be instantly advanced but vast sums could be raised for the improvement of the provinces and the increase of revenue to Britain. Another grievance manifesting the neglect of Government to the concerns of Upper Canada is equally notorious and must be still more abhorrent to the general feelings of your Royal Highness. The young men of this province who were armed in its defence had for their spirited conduct the promise of their commanders that land would be granted them as a reward for their services as soon as war was terminated ; and after this promise was universaly confided in the Parliament of Upper Canada passed an extraordinary law in the face of established British principles that militia should pass beyond the frontier. With these promises and in obedience to this law the militia passed beyond the frontier with alacrity ; yet since the peace the greater part of them had been denied the pledge of their extraordinary services and the land is unjudtly withheld. The petition further states that such ingratitude such dishonour such errors in policy could not exist without extraordinary influences and it recommends most important changes equally for the glory of the throne and benefit of the subject. It says that the scandalous abuses came some years ago to such a pitch of monstrous ingratitude the the home Ministers wisely imposed restriction on the Land Council of Upper Canada. It seems however that all this was insufficient and that confusion on confusion has grown out of this unhappy system. Upper Canada it is now said pines in comparative decay and that discontent and poverty are experienced in a land supremely blessed with the gifts of nature. It is insisted that the immediate interference of his Royal Highness might do much to remove the evils which spring from the system of patronage and favouritism and it asserts that the interposition of the British Parliament is more imperiously required. It concludes as follows:– Deeply penetrated with these sentiments and most seriously inclined to have changes speedily effected the loyal subjects of Great Britain dwelling in Upper Canada now take the extraordinary step of sending home Commissioners to bear this to the throne and humbly intreat your Royal Highness to give ear to the details which it will be in their power to relate: above all that your Royal Highness would immediately send out to this province a commission consisting of discreet and wise men men of business and talent who shall be above every influence here and who may be instructed to make inquiry into all the sources of evil.  ID144,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,06,02,inform,Colonial Intelligence Advices have been received again from the Cape of Good Hope of 6th March which are several days later than those acquired formerly. Of the rising of the Caffres there remains no doubt although it does not appear that Government have as yet received official information regarding it. The private accounts state that two valuable officers had lost their lives and also a great number of men. The Governor himself in order by his presence the sooner to suppress the Caffres had with a competent force proceeded to the interior. Great inconvenience was experienced for the want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not this been the case it was believed that in a very few days tranquility would have been restored. We are sorry to state that another hurricane has taken place in the Isle of France ; it commenced on the 25th January and has done great mischief to the shipping and also to the plantations of that ill-fated Island. A Dutch mail has arrived with papers to the 19th inst. At Batavia two of the leaders of the late disturbances have been tried and execute and that degree of tranquility which terror produces has been restored. In the administration of their colonies in the east the conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and oppressive ; and it is to be regretted that the extensive and fertile island of Java should have been surrendered to their rapacity. During the short time that it was in possession of this country various important improvements were introduced into its domestic administration ; the practise of torture according to the humane and enlightened maxims of British jurisprudence was abolished ; new and better modes of collecting the revenue were adopted ; and a spirit of mildness and of regard for the interests of all the various classes of which the population is composed was evinced which made the British Government highly popular. Considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants for the safety of the Queen Charlotte Jamaica packet. She sailed from Jamaica the 29th March and had a great quantity of specie on board. No things have since been received of her. Several vessels sailed since her departure and have arrived safe.

If we look at the previous strength of the army of this extended Empire the small increase in question will not only excite no alarm but it will be considered absolutely necessary for ordinary purposes.

The gold coins are eagles half eagles and quarter eagles. The first is exactly five and forty shillings English money or ten American coin. The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half and quater which makes the courie of exchange simple and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive that ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle. There is besides one more silver coin which is called a Dime and is the tenth part of a dollar. The copper coin is called a Cent and is the tenth part of a Dime. Six of the ships of war which were voted by Congress in November last are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next and will complete a fleet of??? hundred guns. The city of Washington which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground near the banks of the Potamac possessing a delightful water prospect together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city. From the President's house to the Capitol run two great pleasure parks or malls which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol as well as those of the President's house are of the finest marble.

The emigrations from the different nations in Europe to that country are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually.
