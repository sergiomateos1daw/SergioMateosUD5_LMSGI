The negroes there had conceived an idea that the Parliament of England had set the English negroes free ; where upon those on several of the most considerable estates assembled together to the amount of 4000 and retired to the mountains declaring they would no longer be slaves ; saying that they had as good a right to be free as the negroes in the English islands. What has been the event is unknown ; but some reports say that they had arms and had resisted the military and the militia ; and that 400 had been taken and condemned to die. It is a little singular that such an alarming spirit of discontent should first make its appearance among the French negroes if they are (as has been assented by several writers) so much more civilized so much better treated than those of the English islands. God knows what bloodshed may soon follow from the mistaken humanity of some well meaning but ill informed leaders among you.  ID37,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,14,inform,The West India merchants who were in the utmost anxiety for the arrival of the packet from the West Indies have been most agreebly relieed from their apprehensions. The account of the insurrections in Martinique which we received through France and which has been since confirmed in the National Assembly naturally alarmed them for the British islands. We are happy to inform our readers that the packet brings no intelligence whatever of tumult of insurrections. We have not heard even that the letters bring any account of the conspiracy in Martinique ; a circumstance which can only be accounted for by the little communication which exists between the islands at this season of the year.  ID40,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,14,inform,Extract of a letter from Dominica Sept. 6. This day week the most diabolical design that that ever was formed was discovered in Martinico : It was an insurrection of the negroes who were that night to have set fire to the large and beautiful town of St. Pierre ; while the white people were all in confusion and striving to escape the flames they were to be butchered indiscriminately man woman and child.–The combustibles were laid in upwards of 100 houses consisting of hemp dipped in turpentine. The plot was not discovered till five o'clock in the evening when a negro belonging to an old lady stung with remorse on thinking that he must murder the woman who brought him up form a child disclosed it to her. The Troops being thereupon assembled 40 of the negroes were taken armed with a hanger and a long knife the insturments which were in a few hours to have put a period to the existence of upwards of 5000 people. All the inhabitants have been under arms ever since as they are afraid the negroes will attemp to release the 40 who are in gaol.  ID53,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,04,inform,Extract of a letter from CarricouGrenadaSept. 5. By a vessel which arrived here yesterday from Martinique we are informed that there is an insurrection of the slaves in that island ; at one periot it was supposed that there was not less than ten thousand of them assembled in one body and there are now above four thousand encamped in the neighbourhood of St. Pierre's. The business it is said has originated from an idea they have got that all the slaves in the British colonies are to be liberated and they are resolved to be upon the same footing.  ID81,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,29,inform,DOMINICA. St. Pierre Martinico Sept. 11 This Colony is in a perfect state of anarchy ; is so much that we have had thoughts of quitting the island and going to Trinidad taking the negroes with us. Unless some speedy and effectual succours arrive the colony is utterly ruined. The greater part of the colonists this day assembled at Gros-morne.–The grenadiers who were in the fort of Trinity with twenty three officers of the regiment were glad to make their escape.– There are 1500 men in the FOrt Bourbon many of whom are from Dominica Guadaloupe and other colonies an supposed to have been sent by Martinico refugees.–The firing of cannon is heard incessantly ; at this rate the magazine of powder will soon be consumed. The Municipality of Fort Royal have been obliged to promise and sign whatever the insurgents have been please to dictate.–The soldiers run about the streets and oblige the inhabitants to give them money.–Imagine in short a scene of confusion and terror and you will then have some idea of the persent [?] of Fort Bourbon and Fort Royal. The town of St. Pierre swarms with strangers who come here from all parts. M. Chabrol Colonel of the regiment which has been sent here together with a company of Chaffeurs has been appointed comandant o the NAtional troops. The women confident that it is in his power to re-establish tranquility prostrate themselves before him strew the ground on which he walks with flowers and affectionately embrace him.– He seems willing to comply with their wishes. The Colonial Assembly sits at Gros-morne guarded by an army of 4000 men under the command of M. Dumoise appointed by the General. We are assured that the insurgents are arming four privateers with which they mean to attack Trinity. Some soldiers attempted to penetrate among them but were repulsed by the Mulattoes.  ID341,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,02,22,inform,From the Jamaica Royal Gazette. Kingston Nov. 28. By late arrivals from Hispaniola we learn that the people are in quietness but still armed; and that the Governor who had been suffered to remain but the Intendent only having fled is perfectly submissive to the will of the people. For several days last week the weather at the north side and in some of the Liguanea Mountains blew in most alarming gusts and the cold is said to have been peculiarly sever; some plantain trees have been thrown down but we have yet heard of no material damage. The sloop Resolution has brought into port a part of his Majesty's 10th regiment of foot consisting of a serjeant and 29 privates having received them from on board the ship Commerce Foot from London off the East End on Thursday last the Commerce being destined for Savanna la Mar. Dec. 26. Late on Thursday evening his Majesty's ship Amphion Captain Nichols returned to Port-Royal from the Spanish American coast. The Amphion was bound to Carthagena but was prevented by the jealousy of the Spaniards from entering that port. Accounts are said to be received by her that a revolt has taken place amongst the Indians in that quarter and that the Spaniards are demolishing the fortifications throughout the country which it has cost them so much labour and expence to raise; so appre hensive are they of the numbers and force of the malcontents should they possess themselves of any of those strong holds. We learn from Georgia that the treaty with the Indians to negotiate with Commissioners were appointed by the President of the United States has been broken off; and that Mr. M'Gillivray and his warriors have declared that nothing short of a cession of the territory between the rivers St. Mary and Altamaha will satisfy them; adding that no equivalent can be given to the Georgians for relinquishing their claim to the district in question as it is founded in usurpation. The views of Mr. M'Gillivray in making this requisition are evident as it is known that he wishes to establish a sea-port at St Mary's as well for thecommercial emolument as for the civilization of his countrymen by an intercourse with foreign States.  ID387,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,09,07,inform,Spes addita suscitat iras Hope inflames resentment. Vengeance against the injuries we have inflicted on the Negroes when they are inflamed with the hope of emancipation will be livelier than gratitude for freedom to which they are entitled in justice. The insurrections among the slaves in the French West India islands form a dismal presage of what we may expect in our own. We have managed this business not like men of sense concerned in a general welfare of the British empire but with the pedantry and precipitation of school boys.  ID401,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,12,inform,A singular revolution has taken place at Martinique. The Governor Viscount Damas with the troops had taken possession of St. Pierre's; having established peace as they concluded they retired to Fort Bourbon; the patriots again at ??ed have suprised and taken the fort. The governor has escaped with a company of grenadiers and it is reported he is since joined by about five hundred people of colour.
