They were upon landing at Sheerness from the Retribution put on board the Tottenham which was engaged to land them at their place of punishment. The number on board that ship on leaving Sheerness was between 2 to 300 many of whom were diseased and infirm. Their condition has been rendered most intolerable from an unaccountable delay that has taken place. The ship Tottenham had not proceeded farther than the Downs when she lost her rudder by some accident or other. She returned to Sheerness where she now lies and where she is likely to lie for some time upon the pretence that the loss she has sustained is a justification for delay however protracted. The unfortunate inmates have been led to expect that some important mitigation of their sentence has taken place ;–so that between the suspense and the terrible species of confinement to which they are subject their suffer ings are hardto be described.– Observer. The Hon. Lieut.-Colonel Erskine. –It is with the greatest concern we have to mentioned the death of Lieut.-Colonel Erskine Lord Erskine's youngest son on his passage to Ceylon. He served throughout the campaigns in Spain as a Captain of Light Infantry in the 51st regiment and behaved with great gallantry in the battle of the Pyrenees where being shot in the thigh he was sent home by the Medical Board and on his recovery was placed by the Duke of York on the Staff of the Army in the Adjutant-General's Department when the Duke of Wellington took the command in Flanders. He was in the battle of the 16th of June and afterwards on the 18th at the battle of Waterloo where his station placed him in the dangerous position of being attendant on the Duke around whom almost every officer was either killed or wounded. Amongst the rest this brave young man had his left arm carried off by a cannon-ball which passing along the other laid bare the whole of it by which he lost the use of two of his fingers but that arm was saved. When the cannon-shot had thrown him from his horse and as he lay bleeding upon the groun in this mangled condition the Prussian musketry and trumpets being heard at a distance he seized his hat with his remaining shattered arm. and waving it round him cheered his companions in the midst of the dying and the dead the Duke of Wellington being then close by him who desired he might carried to his tent. It must be some consolation to his afflicted family that he must have distinguished himself in the opinion of his great Commander as he was immediately recommended by him for the rank of Major though a very young officer and in a year afterwards to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel with the appointment of Adjutant-General in Ceylon and if he had then fortunately sailed for India his life might probably have been saved ; but his disposition being as affectionate as it was animated he could not be persuaded to leave Mrs Erskine who was pregnant and remaining here during the winter the cough with consumptive symptoms arising from his wound laid too deep a hold on him to derive benefit from the voyage and he died on his passage to India. Colonel Erskine was only 25 years of age and has left three sons and a daughter and an infant a few months old. The marriage of the Duke of Clarence with the rich heiress Miss Wykeham is said to be finally arranged ; and from what we observe it is not likely to suffer any delay from the late domestic calamity. it is said that the Prince Regent has given his own personal assent ; but whether it has passed through the constitutional forms and that the Royal Assent in Council has been given we do not pretend to know. It must have that sanction to secure the Lady the right for herself and heirs of succeeding to the Throne. On this interesting subject it cannot be forgotten that King in Council refused his assent in three former instances. The refusal of the Princess Royal of Denmark arrived in town on Monday or Tuesday last week. On Wednesday it was communicated to his Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence and on Thursday he set off to Brighton offered his hand to Miss Wykeham and was a thriving wooer. Colonel Henry Fitzclarence the son of the Duke of Clarence lately deceased was a young man of uncommon energy of character and of talents and acquirements. In the affair of the 10th Light Dragoons he displayed a spirit of independence and manliness the most honourable. He was an admirable linguist and as we understand was about to return to England with the view of being employed in the Diplomacy for which he was peculiarly qualified.  ID133,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,10,13,inform,Colonial Intelligence Death of The Duke of Richmond. By the Henry arrived in the rive from Quebec we have advices from thence of the 4th September three days later than the last accounts. They confirm we regret to say the intelligence received at Lloyd's on Friday of the death of the Duke of Richmond at Montreal where he had arrived on his return from inspecting the new settlements in Upper Canada. His body had been brought from Montreal to Quebec where it was lying in state at the time the Henry sail ed. His daughter Lady Mary Lennox continued in the most afflicting state and great fears were entertained for her recovery. Lady Sarah Lennoc his Grace's second daughter is married to Major-General Sir Peregrine Maitland. They accompanied his grace to North America and have remained there since he entered upon his Government. His Grace was the lineal descendant of the first Duke of Richmond natural son of King Charles II. by a French Lady who was created by his Majesty Duchess of Portsmouth and by Louis the Fourteenth Duchess of Aubigny in France. His titles were Duke of Richmond Early of March (English honours) ; Duke of Aubigny (French Honour) ; Duke of Lennox Early of Darnley and Baron Methuen of Torbulton (Scots Honours). The title of Aubigny was confirmed in March 1816 by Louis XVIII by causing the estate of Aubigny to be assigned to him and granting him the honours of the Louvre as enjoyed by his Grace's ancestors. He was a Lieutenant-General in the army Colonel of the 35th regiment of foot Gonervor of Plymouth Governor of Upper and Lower Canada and their dependencies Lord Lieutenant of the county of Sussex and High Steward of Chichester. –His Grace was born in 1764 succeeded his uncle Charles the late Duke in 1806 and married in 1783 Charlotte daughter of Duke of Gordon by whom he had issue seven sons and seven daughters all of them now living except his third son Henry Adam R. N. who fell overboard the Blake as she was sailing into Port Mahon in 1812 and was drowned. His Grace was distinguished early in life by a duel with His Royal Highness the Duke of York. He was of an open candid generous temper and of plain and unaffected manners qualities which were particularly conspicuous in Ireland when Viceroy of that country. His Grace is succeeded in the Peerage his eldest son Charles Earl of March now Duke of Richmond. This young Nobleman in the army has seen much active service under the personal auspices of the illustrious Wellington being one of his Grace's Aides-de-camp and was one of the Representatives in Parliament for the City of Chichester which seat of course becomes vacant. He was lately married to the eldest daughter of the Marquis of Anglesea and has issue a Son now Earl of March. The following is extracted from the Quebec papers: Quebec Thursday Sept. 2. This Province has again been visited by one of those afflicting dispensations of Providence which by separating by the hand of death the ruler from the people covers whole communities with mourning. An express arrived here yesterday morning from Montreal with the afflicting intelligence chief that his Grace the Duke of Richmond Governor in Chief of these Provinces had died on his way from Kingston to Montreal at the moment that he was hourly expected to join his family there from which he had separated in good health at Kingston one the 20th to complete by visiting the new Settlements the long and arduous journey in which he has been engaged. This melancholy and utterly unexpected intelligence spread with the greatest rapidity and impressed a deep gloom throughout the city. The flag on the citadel and on all the vessels in the port was hoisted half-mast exhibiting every where the signals of public mourning. His Grace's body immediately after his death was conveyed to Montreal. It reached this city last evening in the steam-boat Malsham and was removed this forenoon to the Castle with the usual military honours and followed by his Grace's Staff the principal Civil and Military Officers in the City and Garrison and a great concourse of mourning inhabitants. September 5. His Grace's remains were conveyed from Montreal to Quebec in a steam-boat. At ten o'clock one the morning of the 2d of Sept. they were removed from the vessel and placed upon a hearse upon the King's Wharf at Quebec from whence it was conveyed to the Chateau of St. Louis where they lay in state until four o'clock on Saturday the 4th September when they were removed to the place of internment in the Cathedral Church at Quebec. On the corpse being brought out the collar and insignia of the Order of the Garter with his Grace's military and other appointments being placed on the coffin the whole of the troops presented arms. On its being placed on the hearse the troops rested on their arms reversed. The procession then moved forward. It was composed of all the principals persons attached to the public military and civil departments. The military band filed off at the door of the Cathedral Church-yard and conducted it up the centre aisle when it was played on a platform the mourners remaining by the body. A signal was then given when the body was deposited – 15 guns being fired. Extract of a letter dated Quebec Sept 5 :– When I wrote the first side I did not expect so soon to communicate the melancholy event of the death of our Governor the Duke of Richmond who was attacked on his route from Upper Canada with symptoms of hydrophobia which terminated his mortal career at six miles from the settlement of Richmond. He was perfectly sensible of his situation and gave himself up from the first spasm which attacked : it was occasioned by a bite of a tame fox at Sorel on his way to Upper Canada about three months since. His death at this juncture is looked on as very unfortuante for this country as he possessed the entire confidence of Government and was about completing a plan of defence for the Canadas which when executed would establish a water communication with our extreme points perfectly free from interruption in case of a war with the States. We are happy to learn further that no part of his Grace's family was so dangerously ill as was at first reported. They are only in that situation which might be expected from so severe an affliction. Colonel Wilson had succeeded the late Duke of Richmond as Governor-General of both Canadas being the senior Officer on that station. Sir Charles Saxton and Major M'Leod Aides-deCamp to his Grace the Duke of Richmond have gone to Lake Winnipeg clothed with special powers to investigate the causes of the unhappy dissentions which are said to have been lately renewed in that quarter between the North West and Hudson's Bay Company. By the new act regulating the commercial intercourse between the province of Upper Canada and the United States the duties on the importation of manufactures and provisions from the States are considerably reduced on [?] of the enumerated articles although on nails snuff manufactured tobacco and spirits they are riased. The ad-valorem[?] duty is reduced from 10 to 5 per cent. Buffalo Aug. 4. On Friday came[?] on before the Court of King's Beach at Niagara the trial of Robert Gourlay Esq. for a misdemeanour in not obeying the orders of the Magistrates at Niagara in December last. Mr Gourlay was found guilty and banished the province. From the Quebec Gazette of 26th August: This morning about 9 o'clock Lieut. Birch of the royal navy put a period to his existence by shooting himself through the head. We are informed that Mr Birch had for sometime previous to his death laboured under a melancholy state of mind.

The Committee who in the execution of their functions travelled through the greater part of Lower Canada conclude their Report by putting on record a testimony they justly conceive to be honourable to the character of the inhabitants of the country through which they passed. Although many hundreds of persons from all parts of their respective Counties attended the Agricultural Meetings which were frequently of four or five hours duration there did not occur at any of them a single instance of intoxication disorderly conduct or personal altercation. The Grand Jury at Nassau New Providence have brought in a bill against Sir Gregor M'Gregor charging him with aiding and abetting piracy by issuing commissions in the Bahamas to subjects of Power in unity[?] with Spain. A letter from Sierra Leone dated the 9th of March says– It is with the deepest regret I inform you that notwithstanding the liberality of Great Britain and the faith of Treaties the coasts swarms with slave vessels dragging thousnads of its miserable inhabitants into endless captivity. A few days ago arrived here the Union of Liverpool : the Supercargo states that during his stay in the river Calabia not less than eight vessels averaging 500 slaves each had sailed for the Spanish Colonies. We have received Gibraltar Chronicles to the 10th ult. from which we learn that in consequence of the rapid increase of the fever at the Isle de Leon his Excellency Governor Don had issued a Proclamation on the 2d ult. announcing that all communications with Spain (except through the customary process of quatine) would close at sun-set on the following evening. Notice was also given to such of the labouring classes as had not passed the fever that they would be provided with tents and encamped on the neutral ground for their better security against infection should it unhappily appears in the fortress. They would not be suffered to proceed to town and follow their callings during the day but heir return to the encampment at night was peremptorily enjoined. We are happy to learn however by the latest advices from the British fortress that the garrison and inhabitants were not at all infected with the disease.  ID135,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,01,20,inform,Colonial Intelligence York (U.C.) Nov 4. Lord Selkirk vs. North West Company. On Friday the 30th of October the Court of Oyer and Terminer proceeded to try the gentlemen accused as necessaries to the murder of Robert Semple Esq. and others at Red River on the 19th of June 1816 and the trial was rendered extremely interesting by the disclousure which took place of many extraordinary circumstances connected with the Hudson's Bya and North West Companies which for some time past has excited so much of the public attention in this Province. The gentlemen tried on this occasion were Messrs. Alexander Mackenzie Hugh M'Gillis Simon Fraser John Macdonald and John M'Laughlin } accused as accessories after the fact. and Mr John Severlight accused as an accessory before and after the fact. It appeared in evidence that the North West Company had been upwards of thirty years in possession of trading posts called forts at different points on the Red River in the Indian Territories and it is well known that for a century before the North West Company the Canadian for traders had been in the constant practise of resorting to that country which was visited for the first time by traders of the Hudson's Bay Company about twenty-five years ago. It was put in evidence that for many years afterwards both companies carried on their trade to Red River without interference in each others pursuits and without any disturbance in the country ; and it was explained that the principal object of the trade being to collect provisions (enlisting chiefly of the dried flesh of the buffalo which abound in the plains) and the country producing abundance for the supply of both parties the same causes of dissention did not exist as at trading stations where the fine furs are obtained in small quantities and where rival traders would at all times be likely to dispute about the divisions of them. The Red River country therefore remained quiet and undisturbed until the arrival of the Earl of Selkirk's Colonists and Servants and the attempts made by their leaders to prevent the usual supplies of provisions from being obtained by the traders. The proclamation of Miles Macdonnell the soi-disant Governor of Ossinibour prohibiting the exportation of provisions from Red River was the first document produced for the defence at the recent trials. It was proved that under this assumed authority several acts of violence were committed by Mr Macdonnell and his followers. Trading posts and buildings were forcibly entered depots of provisions seized the river (the only outlet from the country) blockaded by batteries mounted with cannon and the trade of the North West Company wholly interdicted before any acts of retaliation were attempted on their part and even before they took any precautions for their own defence or for ensuring the safety of their provisions on which depended the existence of their trade and the lives of their people. Mutual and continual acts of aggression and retaliation appeared to have exasperated the minds of both parties and to have rendered them so suspicious of the designs of each other as to be always on their guard and prepared for defence. In short it appeared in evidence that the country remained in a state of private war which at length ended in the battle of the loch of Jane 1816. The particulars of this unfortunate affray were fully investigated in the trial of Bouche and Brown for murder as principals. The statements on both sides are already before the public and the acquittal of the prisoners shows sufficiently that the jury considered Mr Semple and his party to have been the assailants. On the trial of the alleged accessories the cirumstances which led to the meeting of the hostile parties were made out in the evidence to the following effect viz : – In March 1816 Mr Colin Robertson with an armed party acting under the orders of Governor Semple who had succeeded Governor Miles Macdonnell at Red River captured by surprise the North West trading post at the forks of the river called Fort Gibraltar and took possession of all the stores and provisions. In the latter part of the following month of May Governor Semple caused the buildings (which were of wood) to be taken to pieces and the materials were floated fown the river in rafts to be used in constructing his new fort which he called Fort Douglas and where (following the examples of his predecessors) he mounted cannon to command the passage of the river built an armed schooner or gun-boat to com plete the blockage and effectually to intercept the provisions and trade of the North West Company. Mr. Alexander Macdonnell a partner of the North West Company who had charge of their provisions at Riviere Qui Appele one of the branches of the Red River became alarmed at these measures of hostility and assembled as many people as he could (half breeds and others) for the protection of the property under his care with which at the usual time he proceeded down the river till he arrived within sixty miles of Governor Semple's fort. He then landed his provisions made dispositions to defend them if attacked and sent a party of his people with a temporary supply to meet the canoes from below apprise them of the blockages and concert with them the means of eluding or removing it. This party under the direction of Cuthbert Grant (a half breed and a clerk of the N. West Company) was ordered to land above Fort Douglas in order to keep out of the reach of the cannon and to carry these provisions in carts at as great a distance as possible from the fort so as to avoid being seen.– This it was fully proved they did ; but a swamp in the rear of the fort compelled them to pass within about two miles of it and being deserted and pursued from then the conflict ensued in which Mr Semple and most of his party were killed. It was further made out in evidence that in the Spring of the year 1816 the agent of the North West Company at Montreal were still in need of more than the usual supply of provisions from the Red River because there had not yet been time to replace the vessels on the lakes and the other means of transport which the Americans had destroyed during the war nor to replenish their stores at Fort William with the usual quantity of provisions from Canada. Having also heard of the seizure of one of their posts at Red River in the fall of the year 1815 and apprehending further aggressions in the spring Mr M'Leod one of the agents with all the partners and clerks who could be spared from Montreal proceeded up the country early in the Spring and on arriving at Fort William received intelligence of the capture of Fort Gibraltar and the blockade of Red River towards which place he immediately proceeded with as many of the partners clerks and servants of the Company as he could collect by the way in order to rescue the intercepted provisions in the defence of which or in their own defence if fired on by Semple's blockading battery it was their avowed purpose to use force if necessary but it was distinctly proved that their intentions and orders issued to their cannonmen were to pass Fort Douglas singing and to proceed up the river for their provisions without landing or molesting any one unless they should be attacked.–They arrived at Red River three days after the battle and Mr M'Leod who was a Magistrate being of opinion that Mr Semple's party had been the assailants and that the half breeds had only acted in self defence did not adopt any measures against them (the half breeds) but on the contrary expressed approbation for their having defended their provisions and gave them the supplies of clothing &c. usually given to all the servants of the North West Company while at the same time he arrest some of the survivors of Mr Semple's party and served subpoenas upon others to give evidence of these transactions in the Courts of Lower Canada. This was the whole of the evidence and the only circumstances which appeared relative to the prisoners were that Mr Sevewright (the alleged accessory before the fact) was with Mr Alexander Macdonnell when he sent off Grant and his party to escort the provisions past Fort Douglas and that the alleged accessaries after the fact arrived at Red River with Mr M'Leod after the battle was over and appeared to consider it as it is now found to have been an affray in which the unsuccessful party were to blame and in which the successful party were not murderers –The Judge who presided at the trial declared in his charge to the jury that there was not a scintilla of evidence against any one of these gentlemen and the jury accordinagly returned a verdict of Not Guilty. It will be recollected that these gentlemen were arrested by the Earl of Selkirk at Fort William in Aug 1815 on the charges of High Treason and Conspiracy as well as Murder–and that the buildings and property of the North West Company at that place were forcibly seized and subsequently retained by an armed force under his Lordship's command. The North West Company represented at the time that these accusations were merely a pretext set up to palliate the preconcerted plunder of their property and destruction of their trade while on the part of Lord Selkirk it was alleged that the crimes committed by the partners of the North West Company were so atrocious as to justify his Lordship's proceedings against them ; and for some time the public opinion remained in suspense as to the real merits of the case. So far as regarded the seizure of property and the interruption of trade the point was decided by the Prince Regent's Proclamation of the 3rd of May 1817 in consequence of which the North West Company recovered possession of their property and re-established their trade ; but that proclamation left the rights of parties and the crimes alleged against the individuals to be investigated and decided upon by the law – and until such investigation could take place much uncertainty necessarily prevailed from the contradictory statements and affidavits which had been laid before the public. The recent trials at York however decided the point as to the alleged murders and the charge of High Treason has never been followed up nor ever mentioned since it served the desired purpose by figuring in Lord Selkirk's Warrant as a pretext for seizing and examining the books and private papers of of the North West Company.  ID136,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,01,04,inform,Reform in Upper Canada It has been already mentioned that Governor Maitland on opening the session of the Legislature of Upper Canada recommended that measures should be taken to prevent the meeting of delegates for obtaining reform in Upper Canada. Accounts from Quebec and Montreal dated the end of November state that in pursuance of this recommendation the Legislature on one of the first days of its meeting appointed a Committee to inquire into the subject who almost instantly came to the following resolution Resolved That it is the opinion of this Committee that some such legislative provision should be enacted as the wisdom of the Imperial Parliament has found it proper to provide to meet similar occasions to put it out of the power of any designing persons to organize discontent. The proceeding appears to have raised the indignation of the Gourlay or reforming party in Upper Canada as will be seen by the following extract :– Montreal November 21. This legislative provision it will be immediate ly perceived is the suspension of the Habeas Corpus act for that was the course pursued in England. We do not believe that there is the most remote necessity for such a measure. We do not hesitate to say that the members have not spoken the sentiments of heir constituents in their echo of Sir P. Maitland's speech with the most humiliating servility ; and we feel convinced that it will not be borne with by the people while they have the control in any way of their representatives. The sentiment therein attempted to be disseminated is an libel on the truly loyal people of Upper Canada. It would sound in our ears like the knell of their liberty if we were not persuaded that its adoption would provoke a spirit of resistance not corporal but mental ; not secret and illegal but open and legitimate which (if the Administration do not take the decision of the question from the people by force and we believe they cannot nor dare not) will serve to purge the constitution of the united province from the injury which it has received by mal-administration.  ID142,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,27,inform,Emigration to America Important Extracts of a Letter from a very Intelligent and respectable Engineer in Louisville dated January 20. 1819. The best time for coming to America I should judge to be in the summer to land in September so as to be able to get here before the weather was too cold. It is safe to settle in the beginning of winter or spring so as to inure to the climate by degrees. The best plan for coming is to take a part of the steerage of a vessel and find your own provisions; you will save more in this way over a cabin passage than would buy a decent farm here. The lands in this neighbourhood raise a crop of wheat and one of corn alternately and improve ; dung is never applied and is said to be hurtful. It is without question what the land here is as good as can be and when to this is added the heat of the summer one ought to be able to raise crops as heavy as they will stand. You wonder at 10 dollars being enough to clear an acre. It is not cleared all the trees under 12 inches are cut down and burned on the ground and the large ones are killed by cutting round the bark. The ground is then prepared for Indian corn by scratching it with a hoe or a kind of shuffle which from the looseness and mellowness of the soil is easily done and in this way sixty or eighty bushels an acre are sometimes raised. – the trees die in a few months and in three or four years fall down one by one and the roots will rot out in seven or eight years. It is a great want of sense in any new settler not to adopt the modes of this country proven to be the best adapted to the state of it by 200 years experience. The Americans of all other people I know of are the most ingenious in adapting the means to the end. I do not know if they have more sense than other nations but they certainly make it go farther. Every tools answers the purpose most effectually. This is evident in their axes. An American will cut down three times more trees and square three times more timber than the best of your wrights could do and not by more strength but by fitter tools. So it is with cutting their grain ; a man will cut down four acres of wheat in a day what what he calls a cradle scythe and lay it as refular for binding as reapers can do. Sixty bushels of Indian corn is the average of Kentucky ; but 25 bushels of wheat is about the average of an acre. It is easier farming here than with you on sundry accounts ; the soil is free few weeds make their appearance and when ploughed down are certainly killed by the hot sun. There are no frosts to injure the crop and no wet weather to destroy it when cut. Hay is made in two days and grain is cut one day and stacked or housed the next. From the shortness and mildness of the winter little provender is needed for the stock. Swine are raised at no expence. They breed and feed in the woods and only want from one to three bushels of corn to fatten for killing when they sell for five cents a lb. In the less settled parts of the country it is the practise to give all the corn to swine and then send them to market. A bushel of corn is equal in nutriment to a bushel of wheat for man or beast.  ID143,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,07,inform,The brig Henry sailed from Cork on Wednesday se'ennight with about two hundred passengers for Aux Cayes to join Sir Gregor M'Gregor who lately landed on the Spanish Main with a small force. General M'Gregor it seems left authority with Colonel Eyre to recruit men for his service and to ship them as he best could. – There are a number of idle gentlemen about Dublin at present and also many in the country who have been captivated with the speculation of embarking in the Patriotic cause and for some time they have appeared in the streets in fanciful uniforms. We understand that Col. Eyre has formed a Committee who treat with such young gentlemen as have the inclination to proceed on the enterprise and have money to pay for such rank as they may wish to possess under M'Gregor. The money thus furnished is made a stock purse to pay the freight of the vessel and hence it is necessary that the greater part of the adventurers should be officers ; for those who are contented with the humble station of privates are not required to contribute and their passage subsistence &c. must be defrayed by the common fund. Mr D'Evereaux from the county of Wexford is also raising men for the same service but under different circumstances. He professes to have authority from General Bo livar to grant commissions and to ship the men he may raise for head-quarters in Venezuela. Mr D'Evereaux has not yet dispatched any men and Col. Eyre has certainly shewn more activity in this respect. – Dublin Journal.  ID145,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,06,28,persuade,Emigration. The increased population of this country as well as the great difficult to which the middling classes of society are exposed in their efforts to procure the ordinary means of sustenance has given rise to the formation of little copartnerships or joint stock companies of individuals who being unable to command capital enough singly to encounter the expences of a new settlement have put their little funds together with a determination to sail for America and there jointly to labour for the general good of the whole until fortune shall so far favour their efforts as to enable them to become independent of each other. By this means much less than the hundred pounds stipulated by Mr Birkbeck as the proper stock for an emigrant to begin with will be sufficient ; and thus a new impetus will be given to that tide of huma beings which is constantly flowing towards the new world. Would it not be policy to give encouragement to these industrious swarms to settle in our own colonies? We have heard with some pleasure in rumour that several parishes have taken into their serious consideration the prudence of establishing a fund for the encouragement of those poor persons who may be dispoed to seek a means of occupation in Canada ; in furtherance of which laudable design an application is to be made to Government for grants of land in desirable siutations especially in Upper Canada where the climate is described to be of the finest description. There is no doubt that many who are now pining in workhouses would gladly accept of such an alternative and who instead of being as at present a burthen to themselves and to society would by their exertions be adding to the importance and stability of our possessions in that quarter as well as opening a new source for the consumption of our manufactures.  ID146,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,06,28,inform,Letter from Mr Morris Birkbeck English Prairie (Illinoia) Nov.25. 1818. Sir – Your favour of 15th June is before me. Presuming you retain a copy of the queries I proceed to answer then in order: – Respecting domestic servants ; what may be the condition of our colony in two years it is impossible to foresee but should it be in your power to bring with you female domestics it would be well to do so ; also a carpenter or two and a few labourers ; if with families so much the better. Written engagements for a term or indentures are not binding unless renewed on this side of the Atlantic. I have not seen any of these documents and can therefore give you no precise directions for them : perhaps a simple engagement from the parties acknowledging as a debt the expence incurred in bringing our might be a sufficient security leaving their wages to be determined here according to the current rates yet to be established by the proportion of supply to the demand which as I remarked above it is now impossible to ascertain. As to the number of labourers or female domestics you would need perhaps six of the former and two of the latter would a safe adventure looking to the colony for an addition should you need it after you are settled – before that you will find a greater number an incumbrance : this is I think all I can say to your first third fourth and fifth queries. All expence of transfer of your family and luggage supposing the latter to weigh ten thousand pounds I should estimate under L.1000 sterling. On this particular subject Mr R. Flower would give you most particular information – The luggage would cost about ten dollars per 100 lbs. So much for your query. To the seventh query – I think L.200 would assist your family in plenty for a year exclusive of wages and clothing. Eighth query – L.3000 would be a good capital for a section or 640 acres and I question your wishing to hold in cultivation a larger tract. Ninth query – I consider our situation not liable to future disturbance from Indians in the event of a war between Great Britain and the United States being covered by increasing settlements to the west north-west and north. Tenth query – The earthquakes mentioned by Bradbury I have heard of from many persons ; but I have not discovered that it has left any impression on the public mind ; on this score for my own part I feel no anxiety about the matter ; Great Britain I suppose in proportion to its dimensions is equally liable to earthquakes. Elenventh query – The route by New Orleans will I have no doubt be preferable to that by the eastern cities. When due precaution against the diseases of the climate are observed I have never failed to recommend it. Twelfth query – The health of my family has not suffered from the climate. One of my sons has been affected with ague. This summer has been more sickly in these parts than any season for seven years past and has afforded me a most encouraging confirmation of the temperature and salubrity of our settlement and has also afforded immeasurable proofs of those facts regarding the sufferings of new settlers to which I have so anxiously invited the attention of the readers of my journal. On the whole provided common sense should be seconded by common industry in the inclosure and cultivation of our colony I think we shall not be visisted by more than our due share of physical calamity. I deferred noticing your second query the subject being connected with the proposal respecting land at the conclusion of your letter. I would strongly recommend your deferring the purchase of land until your arrival. It would be difficult to convey to you the reasons but you would feel the propriety of my advice should you come. I think you would have as good a choice two years hence as now because excellent siutations as yet unsurveyed will then be on sale. I have no eligible offer to make you beyond a section. You inquire concerning venomous reptiles ; they are no source of injury or alarm to us. Insects in new countries often abound to an astonishing degree and are sufficiently teazing to man and beast. Many species yield instantly to cultivation and are heard of no more as plagues ; others will continue until conquered by order and industry. The thermometer ranges from 13 below zero to 89 above ; the extremes are of course of rare occurence and short duration. At Philadelphia I understand it rose this summer 97 and in this neighbourhood in the low river bottoms I believe it might reach that degree. On our praire I think it never reached 89. The smaller streams are rapid and soon dry ; the larger sluggish in the extreme – catfish perch sturgeons abound and many others I believe.

General Maitland assured them he would not depart without adopting measures in their favour and immediately issued a proclamation appointing a commission of payment.

This production is of the same stamp as him other lucubrations abounding with strong and vigorous assertions in place of facts–a well wove sophistry to beguile the superficial reader ; and some of the most egregious errors in colonial policy recommended with a speciousness well calculated to deceive. Having so often stated out dissent from the political proceeding of this reformer it would be deemed intrusive by many of our readers to enter into a refutation of the tenets or an exposure of the absurdities contained in his address. By others we might be supposed as exalting over a prostrate foe. Both imputations we utterly disclaim ; while as men we regret that the mad career pursued by Mr Gourlay has deprived society of the benefits which might have been reaped from his better talents (of which he doubtless has a share) we must as good subjects feel happy that his career has been checked without any bad consequences to society. The following is the present distribution of the forces in the West Indies:– 2d Regiment (or Queen's) –Demerara. 4th Ditto–Head-quarters Grenada five companies; Trinidad three companies ; and Tobago two companies. 5th Ditto–Head-quarters Antigua five companies ; St. Christopher's four companies ; Montserrat one company. 9th Ditto–Head-quarters St Vincent's five companies ; Dominica three companies ; St Lucia two companies. 21st Ditto (Fusileers)–Barbadoes. 1st West India Regiment–Head-quarters Barbadoes six companies ; St Lucia one company ; Dominica two companies ; Antigua one company. 3rd Ditto–Head-quarters Trinidad five companies till further orders.

London 1819. The sufferings to which many individuals have been exposed who have emigrated to his Majesty's foreign possessions unconnected and unprovided with any capital or even the means of support having been very afflicting to themselves and equally burdensome to the colonies to which they have proceeded the Government have determined to confine the application of the money recently voted by Address in the House of Commons to those persons who possessing the means will engage to carry out at the least ten ablebodied individuals above 18 years of age with or without families the Government always reserving to itself the right of selecting from the several offers made to them those which may prove upon examination to be most eligible. In order to give some security to the Government that the persons undertaking to make these establishments have the means of doing so every person engaging to take out the above-mentioned number of persons or families shall deposit at the rate of 10l. (to be repaid as hereinafter mentioned) for every family so taken out provided that the family does not consist of more than one man one woman and two children under 14 years of age. All children ahove the number of two must be paid for in addition to the deposit above-mentioned in the proportion of 5l. for every person between the ages of 14 and 18. In consideration of this deposit a passage shall be provided at the expence of Government for the settlers who shall be victualled from the time of their embarkation until the time of their landing in the Colony. A grant of land under the conditions hereafter specified shall be made to him at the rate of 100 acres for every such person or family whom he so takes out ; one-third of the sum advanced to Government on the outset shall be repaid on landing when the victualling at the expense of the Government shall cease. A further proportion of one-third shall be repaid as soon as it shall be certified to the Governor of the Colony that the settlers under the direction of the person taking them out are actually located upon the lands assigned to them ; and the remainder at the expiration of three months from the date of their location. If any parishes in which there may be a redundancy of population shall unite in selecting an intelligent individual to proceed to the Cape with settlers under his direction not less in number and of the description above-mentioned and shall advance money in the proportion above-mentioned the Government will grant land to such an individual at the rate of 100 acres for every head of a family leaving the parish at liberty to make such conditions with the individual or the settlers as may be calculated to prevent the parish becoming again chargeable with the maintenance of such settlers in the event of their return to this country. But no offers of this kind will be accepted unless it shall be clear that the persons proposing to become settlers shall have distinctly given their consent and that the head of each family is not infirm or incapable of work. It is further proposed that in any case in which one hundred families proceed together and apply for leave to carry out with them a minister of their own persuasion Government will upon their being actually located assign a salary to the minister whom they may have selected to accompany them if he shall be approved by the Secretary of State. The lands will be granted at a quit rent to be fixed which rent however will be remitted for the first 10 years ; and at the expiration of three years (during which the party and a number of families in the proportion of 1 for every 100 acres must have resided on the estate) the land shall be measured at the expense of Government and the holder shall obtain without fee his title thereto on a perpetual quit rent not exceeding[?] in any case of 2l. sterling for every 100 acres subject however to this clause[?] beyond the usual reservations*–that the land shall become forfeited to Government in case the party shall abandone the estate or not bring it into the cultivator within a given number of years. I am Your most obedient servant. * The usual reservations are the right of the Crown to mines of precious stones of gold and silver and to make such roads as may be necessary for the convenience of the Colony. There are already three extensive settlements on the South East Coast of Africa where the finest wheat is produced with little labour namely Algoa Bay St. Catherine's Bay and the new settlement on the Knysua a considerable river which is navigable for large vessels to the Northward. There are also extensive and fertile lands towards Saldanha Bay. As the produce from the new colonists will consist of grain and as the markets of the Cape of Good Hope the Isle of France Brazils &c. will in all probability be soon overstocked the settlers will look to the mother country for a market when an unfavourable harvest renders the import necessary ; and in anticipation of this event the merchants interested in the Cape trade intend we understand to make an application to Government respecting the Corn Laws to put the corn from the Cape of Good Hope on the same footing as grain from the British North American colonies.  ID150,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,07,07,inform,Colonial Intelligence The accounts received on Tuesday from the Cape of Good Hope are to the 17th April which are considerably later than those previously received. Information has just reached Cape Town that a detachment of troops joined by a number of the inhabitants who had been sent to suppress the Caffres had succeeded in driving them back and were compelled to cross the river. The corn districts were in a great measure cleared of the savages and the country-people were returning to their homes where they considered themselves secure from any further attacks at least for some time to come. Letters have just been received via Calcutta from New South Walves up to the end of November. The colony was then all well and several convict-ships (the Marley Glory Mario Isabella and others) had arrived having made the passage out direct in the short period of three months and twenty days and landed all their convicts and passengers in good health. This may be considered as another among many proofs that it is unnecessary to make any stay at any intermediate port. Extract of a letter from Sierra Leone dated January 9 It is with the deepest regret I inform you that notwithstanding the liberality of Great Britain and the faith of treaties solemnly entered into this coast swarms with slave vessels drugging thousands of its miserable inhabitants into endless captivity.

An intelligent Canadian in easy circumstances with whom we conversed and who goes thither with the before-mentioned settlers with all his family says he passed a winter there when engaged in this for trade and reports it to be a fertile country and the climate much milder than that of Canada.

The Caffres have broken out and a very serious war is carried on at present on the borders. It is said that the savages are to the amount of 50000 and a detachment of 6000 attacked Graham's Town on Saturday week about 12 o'clock in the day but were repulsed and 150 left dead on the fiel. They carried off 500 wounded. Orders have been issued in every district of the colony for the young boors to inrol themselves to oppose the enemy. Cape Town May 16.

(From Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.) The Chancellor of the Exchequer has submitted to Parliament the expediency of voting t50000 towards the encouragement of emigration to the Cape of Good Hope. Let it be remembered once for all that it is not because that colony is too thin of inhabitants but that the mother country is too full that this plan is suggested. The question is not how you maintain a surplus peasantry in the land that gave them birth but whether you will stop emigration to the frozen shores of Canada and to the United States or divert and encourage it to the finest colony in the world – We surely have learnt enough of North America to convince us of the degraded and miserable conditions of its people. South African on the other hand has every advantage to repay the sacrifice of quitting the land of our forefathers. The more fully to understand and appreciate these advantages we shall set before our readers a short view of the conditions and facilities of the colony in question. The spring from September to December is the most agreedable season. The summer from December to March is often intensely hot. The autumn from March to June is generally fine and pleasant. The winter is rainy and stormy and for the most part so cold as to make fires very comfortable during the months of July August and September. Most of the diseases that appear among the natives proceed rather from their gross and indolent modes of living than the unheathliness of the climate. The scarcity of water in summer is unfavourable to cultivation ; and for want of industry or materials this defect is not remedied as it is in India by artificial tanks or reservoirs. Whenever however irrigation can be employed either from wells or rivers the most abundant vegetation ensues. Good and abundant water has always been found by digging wells in Cape Town and the vicinity. In the whole colony there is scarcely a river that can be called navigable. Though swollen into torrents during the winter most of them dry up during the summer. All the rivers are well stocked with perch eels and small turtle ; and with a certain distance from the coast they abound with the several fish peculiar to these seas. There is general want of wood in South Africa – At the distance however of 1.5 miles from Algoa bay there is a large forest of a many thousand acres. Some of these trees (taxus elongatus) grow to the amazing size of 10 feet in diameter and to the height of 30 or 40 feet of trunk clear of branches. The wood is useful for many purposes but will not bear exposure to weather. The iron-wood grows to the size of 3 feet in diameter and the trunk straight and very high – The Hassayni wood is a beautiful tree... The Constantia wine is known throughout Europe and to what perfection the other wines of the colony are capable of being brought may very fairly be augured for the great improvement that has already taken place in its manufacture. Heretofore the Dutch farmer and the merchant have regarded more the quantity than the quality of their wine. And when a cargo was once shipped it mattered little to them whether sound or sour it reached its destination. Little care was taken in the growth of the vine ; the branches were permitted to rest upon the groun ; while decayed and unripe grapes stalks and leaves were all promiscuously thrown in the wine-press. The mode also of seasoning the casks with brimstone and the want of good brandy to fit it for foreign markets have all contributed to deteriorate the character and confine the sale of Cape Madeira. These defects have lately been in a great measure remedied. Proper persons have been sent out from Madeira and this country and every care seems now taken to meet and secure the growing demand in European markets. The trifling duty affixed to Cape Madeira in this country has been the means of introducing it into many families which have hitherto used home-made wines. And though the merchants at Madeira have made many remonstrances on this preference it surely is but equitable that encouragement should be given to the stape export of a colony now decidely and we must trust unalterably English. But in addition to wines there are other articles of colonial growth exported to the East Indies Europe and America. Grain wool bides and skins whale oil and bone dried fruits salt provisions soap and candles aloes tobacco. Such are the articles of commerce that might be turned to the best account. – But neither trade nor prosperit of any kind will continue to thrive in this colony under the present mode of administering its government and laws. It has been said that despotism would be the best of governments were the despot virtuous. This may be ; but contituted as human nature is we fear that the purest amongst us needs some control. Control however there is none over the governor at the Cape. He makes and annuls laws at pleasure. He inserts a proclamation in the Cape Gazette and from that moment his fiat becomes the law of the land. He has indeed an adviser in the colonial secretary whose influence does not extend beyond that of mere advice. Strange to add the laws at the Cape are at this moment Dutch laws rescinded and obscured by all the edicts of the different governors of the colony. All pleadings are in writing and were till laterly carried on foribus clausis. In 1797 a court of appeal for criminal and civil cases was established over both of which the governor presides. In India in the West Indies and in Canada there is a governor and a council. These act as checks upon each other. But at the Cape there is no appeal beyond the governor. The taxes however at the Cape under which we groan so painfully in this country are comparatively trifling. European luxuries very justly pay a heavy import duty but their purchase is matter of choice.– This falls not upon the poor not consequently will it fall upon those most likely to emigrate under the provisions of the Parliamentary grant. Noting indeed can be framed with greater care and precautions than the encouragement bedd out in Mr Vansittuart's proposal. A small deposit L. 10. is to be made at the colonial office in Downing Street by each individual. A free passage is to be granted and on reaching the Cape this deposit is to be returned to the settler by the local government. And such is the liberality that has guided the proposed plans it is moreover stipulated that if 100 families should agree to emigrate and their minister with them not only permission will be granted them so to do but provision will be made for him. The separation from country and from kindred is thus softened and it will allay many a sorrowing regret and painful recollection that in distant lands and amongst a strange people the settler may still listen to the voice and instruction of a pastor to whom custom veneration and affection have all united to attach him. It appears that the experiment of a settlement of English has already been made upon a limited plan at Saldanha Bay (the finest harbour in South Africa) : and with such success as to give the best encouragement to a more extensive emigration. Indeed from what we have outselves seen of the colony and its great facilities we have no doubt whatever of the benefits that must arise to the sober steady exertions of the industrious. At the Cape or elsewhere poverty and misery will attend the vicious and indolent but certain we are that there is no country under heaven where the poor may find a safer asylum and where activity economy and good conduct will meet with so certain and full a reward. During the stay of the 93rd regiment of foot (a Scotch regiment) at the Cape many of the privates were known to save the whole of their pay and were thus enabled to return to England with a very hand some little fortune. English servants of all descriptions are in great request and 1.5 sterling a month are no uncommon wages for a tolerable cook. It is nevertheless to beremember that clothes of all kinds are expensive at the Cape as no manufactory is permitted lest it should injure the trade of this country. Still farmers in the country dress very coarsely and cheaply ; and their wives and daughters except on Sunday are humbly clad as themselves. Indeed in so soft a climate as the Cape there is that occasion for multiplicity and warmth of apparel which colder regions require. For three-fourths of the year the best bed is a hard mattress with a single coverlet. There is point which we cannot pass over ; as we think it very intimately connected with the virtue and happiness of the settlers. And that is the education of their children. Nothing is more neglected than this in Southern Africa. The boors (farmers) are ignorant to a degree passing credence. With the minister that is to accompany 100 families it would be highly expedient to send a few sober intelligent men as schoolmasters. Attempts have been lately made to introduce into the colony the Madras system of instruction and a free school upon that plan has been established at Cape Town with considerable success. Still the natives are stubbornly averse to instruction. Their luxurious and bountiful climate supplies them with all the necessaries of human life and beyond this they have neither wish nor ambition. But if knowledge has its fruits ignorance has its weeds. The savage and unparalleled cruelties that have heretofore been exercised towards their slaves and the Hottentot servants by these Dutch boors may very fairly be traced to want of education as a main cause. The unjust limits shown by the Dutch laws to the white man's barbarities have doubtless encouraged their perpetration – Cruelty is not the character of Englishmen and therefore too much care cannot be taken to guard the families of the new settlers against the contagion of the inhumanities that they must see practised around them and how far an early and thorough acquaintance with our duty to God and man will counteract this influence aided a knowledge of common school attainments we need not say. The We have thrown these remarks together more as loose hints for the consideration of our readers than with any idea of furnishing a complete view of so wide and important a subject. We may be induced hereafter to review the question more in detail. The plan itself as confessed by the Chanceller of the Exchequer has at present assumed a very imperfect shape. Americe we have not seen and can only speak from the reports of other. Those reports are sufficiently discouraging. On the contrary all who have seen and described the Cape have united in praising it. Food is cheap and abundant the price of labour is exceedingly high trade is important and increasing many parts of the colony are beautiful and its climate is mild and healthy. There are few countries upon earth where so many components of happiness will be found to concentrate.  ID154,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,10,11,inform,Emigration to the Cape of Good Hope.

The Shipley with dispatches and troops on board was to sail on the first and may therefore be expected daily in this country.  ID156,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,11,10,inform,Colonial Intelligence Spanish Town Jamaica –August 31. The mail will convey to you sufficiently afflicting news of the voyages which the fever is committing amongst us. Part of the 92nd and 50th have made their escape on board the Serapis 64 which has been roofed to and most handsomely and humanely given up by the Admiral for the use of the troops. The loss in men stands about thus: 59th[?] 200[?] ; 92d 120. The 58th and 81st are scattered[?] ; but from all I can learn their loss is not great. The following is a list of the officers and their relatives who have fallen victims in the course of this month : – Lieut.-Colonel Sparrow Deputy Adjt.-General. Lieut.-Colonel [?] 52d regiment. Lieut.-Colonel Hill th[?] regiment. Major Rowe 50th regiment son-in-law of Paymaster Montgomery of the 50th. Mrs Rowe wife of Major Rowe whom she survived but a few hours and daughter of Paymaster Montgomery. Major Montgomery 50th son of Paymaster Montgomery. Mrs Montgomery wife of ditto. Assistant Surgeon Brown 50th son in-law of do. Lieut. Richardson 50th. Lieut. North[?] 50th. Lieut. and Adjutant Lyon 50th. Two Misses Lyon daughter of Adjutant Lyon. Lieuts. R. M'Donald and George Mackie 92d. Ensign [?] [?]th Doctor [?] Medical Staff. Captain and Paymaster Turner 58th. The Misses Baxter daughters of Quarter-Master Baxter[?]. The scenes that have occurred during this awful mortality have been most distressing. It has not been confined to the military for the inhabitants have even out numbered them. The Quebec Mercury of the [?] gives long extracts from the American papers respecting the [?] of a large tract of country by the [?] Indians to the British Government 2748000 acres stretching from the upper part of the midland[?] district towards the lower part of the province in the rear of the old settlements on the Ottawa and not in any manner coming into contact with or approach within many miles of the boundary of Louisiana. Yet upon the supposition that Great Britain is thus extending her Canadian territory the American Papers are loud in their invectives against this country. Letters have been received from Mogadoru[?] dated the 28th September which mention that the plague which had been for some time in the vicinity had at length broken out in that town. We are happy to add however that the deaths at that period were only three or four each day and it was then confined to the Moors ; none of the Christians or Jews having fallen victims to the pestilence. The weather being extremely cold great hopes were entertained that the further progress of the disease would speedily be put a stop to when trade which then at a stand would renew its wanted[?] activity. The whole population of Mogadoru is between 10 and 12000 persons ; by far the greater part of whom consider it contrary to their religious tenets to use any caution to prevent their taking the infection ; and in the event of their having it would not for the same reason have recourse to any means to counteract it.  ID157,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,02,15,inform,Emigration to America [ From the Observer. ] The following letter from a lady who emigrated to America from within four miles of Godalming in Surrey two years back has been handed to us for insertion. During the present rage for emigration we think we are justified in giving it insertion leaving it to those who are interested in its contents to draw their own con clusions. We have reason to conclude that the letter is genuine and is not we believe as many have been which have found their way into the public press the produce of ingenuity on this side the Atlantic: – Philadelphia July 29. 1818 My dear Sir – I have received your welcome letter together with the patterns you were kind enough to forward Although our habits here are in many respects different from those on your side of the Atlantic yet I assure there is a considerable degree of anxiety among our American belles for English fasions ; and the display which your prompt attention to my request has enabled me to make has procured me not alone a great influx of visitors but of business. You ask me to give you my candid opinion of the policy of removing hither with your wife and family. I can have no hesitation in complying with this request ; but at the same time I shrink from the responsibility of your being persuade from any things which I may say to follow my example. It is impossible to disguise from myself and I would not attempt to disguise it from you that many who have come here anticipating prosperity and independence have failed ; but at the same time as far as my humble observation has enabled me to judge I am persuaded that many of those failures have been the result of unpardonable imprudence and the absence of that activity and spirit of perseverance by which persons depending on their own exertions can alone expect to succeed. I have seen many individuals here reduced to very melancholy straits from having left their native shores thoughtlessly without more money than was sufficient to support them for a fortnight. –. This has been dissipated on their landing almost before they had recovered the effects of a long and fatiguing voyage ; and being thus reduced to extremity their spirits have failed and they have at once sunk into a state of apathy and listless despair. Those who have labouring and mechanic trades to follow and will sumbit to degradation as some of them call it of becoming journeymen do tolerably well. With regards to myself I need not recall to your mind the species of drudgery to which I was forced to submit in order to support a decent appearance in London. You often joked me on my enterprising disposition and doubted my resolution to come to this country in search of that independence which I foresaw I could never obtain at home. Here I am however and an hour since I had the pleasure of paying 30 work women the lowest of whose weekly wages I those who take their work home is five dollars! You will start at this and so will Mrs B. It is however no less true than extraordinary. In short I have every reason to be grateful to Providence for having given me the confidence to sufficient to try an experiment which has turned out so fortunately. I have commenced both millinery and dress-making to which I have added the childbed and ready made linen business ; and in every one of branches I am full of orders. My most sanguine hopes have been realized. My capital at the beginning was exactly 1.60 Sterling and a few of those articles of stock which were necessary to make a show. These combined with the attractive titled of Miss P– from London'&c. in a few weeks set me afloat in a surprising manner. I did my utmost to please my customers and in a few months moved from a situation of obscurity to one of the first respectability. I am thus particular because I know you feel an interest in my fate. My brother James who you know is a bricklayer and builder has been equally fortunate.– He has had several contracts and is now building a row of twenty houses besides other jobs of a smaller description. Of the other fiften persons who accompanied us from Godalmbing and its neighbourhood I am proud to say they have all been tolerably successful. The greater part of them you know were farmers and they are now settled in farms of from fifty to five hundred acres from one hundred to one thousand miles from this place. All these hoever came out with small capitals–but none with less than myself–and husbanding their resources and abstaining from extravagance of every description they finally successed in laying the foundation of their own future happiness. We all have our own prejudices in favour of our old habits ; but this must wear off in the course of time?other there is a roughness and absence of what we call good manners about some of the Americans not at all congenial to English taste. They are for the most part however hospitable ; and if you let them have their way and do not thwart their humours are really very kind and disposed to friendly intercourse. You talk to carrying your family to the Western states–to the Illinois country and of commencing farmer and storekeeping there. It is probably that your views may be very correct but I think you may settle nearer to us if not at so cheap a rate at best with a greater certainty of present comfort. Of the Western States I of course can know nothing but by report. The emigration in that direction has been immense but the journey to some has been so long as frequently to produce repentance before the destined goal was reached. We have had several English Scotch and Irish families here on the way to Pittsburgh who I understand were bound for Mr Birkbeck's settlement ; but I have not heard of their arrival. The greater part have gone down the Ohio in arks which you say you have seen described in Birk beck's books. No doubt these people must have to encounter great privations and perhaps some danger ; time and perseverance howeverwill overcome all difficulties and from the natural course of things in the end the great object in view plenty and independence must be attained ; and this as you very justly say is worth a struggle. Upon the whole if you can be content to give up all those luxuries of which an English fireside is the scene ; to abandon the habits of social intercourse to which an English neighbourhood give encouragement ; and to derive happiness from the consciousness of seeing yourself surrounded by an abundance of the necessaries of life alone ; you cannot fail of success. I agree with you that a vast deal of the pleasure of England are counterbalanced by the castant visitation of the tax-gathered. From these at least you will be free here ; and as for society your own family large as it is must be a treasure in itself ; added to which in proportion as wealth increases civilisation must follow. If you could get three or four families with whom you are acquainted to join in your plans and settle in your neighbourhood an additional assuance of success and happiness would be attained. As to capital I think you ought to hav on your landing here L. 500 which with moderate exertions and common good fortune must afford yo uthe means of certain prosperity. I shall however write again in September on this subject when I intend sending for my sister and perhaps the information I may be able to collect in the interim will confirm your plans and induce you to accompany her to this side of the water. I rather think we shall shortly have another cargo from Surrey ; I will let you know every particular in my next as well as send you a list of the things which it will be policy for you to bring with you. Your seven children instead of being a burden to you here will form one of the most prominent sources of your wealth.  ID158,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,01,13,inform,Emigration to Canada. About ten days ago an emigrant arrived from Canada to Paisley and brings very favourable intelligence from that country. He is a native of Scotland ; was some time in the army ; and is going home again as he calls it early in the spring. This person gives the most satisfactory and cheering account of the place and says his chief complaint was the want of society to share in his felicities to be companion of his joys and to exult in his abundance. He adds that one of his principal reasons for coming here at present was hearing of our distressed condition and that he might be able to persuade others to follow his example ; anxious to be surrounded by happy intelligent and social neighbours. His arrival and narrations combined with other circumstances have been the subject of considerable discussion the whole of last week. A strong desire for emigration has been manifested and about 300 have already subscribed their names as a testimony of their ardour to go away. A petition is immediately to be forwarded to his Majesty's Ministers imploring their assistance by way of loan or donation to enable them to carry their wishes into execution. This petition it is said is to be supported by the principal gentlemen of the county and the utmost anxiety will doubtless prevail concerning its success. – Let us hope that Government will see the necessity of attending to the supplications of these people. The Sheriff Depute has been memorialized upon the subject to give his counsel and support in behalf of the measure and it is much to his honour that he has evinced a great disposition to favour the object in view. His office has been appointed for the reception of signatures where the persons experience the greatest kindness in every possible way. It is proper at the same time to mention that a number who were wishing to subscribe as desirous to emigrate have been rejected ; as their circumstances were not of that despairing nature as to warrant an interposition of this kind in their favour. It cannot be expected that those who enjoy a considerable degree of comfort at home or who have sufficient means of their own to emigrate without public aid ought to be included among that number destined to participate in this salutary and benevolent proposition. Some of the fiercer radicals with their accustomed zeal and spleen are busily employed in jeering and deprecating the idea of emigration and telling the people to stay and help in the recovery of their rights. They declare the whole scheme to be a mere farce intended to be played against them in order to destroy the unanimity which they say exists in the nation concerning their grand object. These querulous politicians complain of the climate of Canada and it must be granted that it resembles Italy more than Scotland being hotter in summer and coller in winter than our own island but the country is healthy the soil is fruitful and strong constitutions and longevity are as common there as in any other part of the globe. The same manners language and regulations prevail in Upper Canada as in Scotland and when people have plenty of provisions fuel and warm clothing to resist the effects of heavy snows and intense frosts the objection of cold is less worthy of consideration. – Glasgow Chronicle.  ID159,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,01,24,entertain,Dutch Colonial Law and Negro Fortitude. (From Lavaysse's Account of Venezuela Trinidad Margaritta and Tobago just published.) Stedman after having given a picture of the cruelties practised on the negroes at Surinam relates that on his arrival in that colony a white man was flagged by a black executioner for having stolen some money from the townhouse ; and he remarked that this negro inflicted the punishment with great signs of commiseration. A negro was broken on the wheel for the same crime and he bore that horrible punishment without a sigh. A moment afterwards they prepared to hang another and whilst the hangman was tying the cord round his neck to launch him into eternity he looked steadfastly with a smile of contempt at his judges who were among the spectators of the execution. Having expressed to the persons who were near me (says Captain Stedman) how much I was shocked with the injustice and cruelty of those executions and surprised at the intrepidity of the negroes during the punishment a very decent looking man thus addressed me ; Sir you are newly arrived from Europe ; but if you were better acquainted with negro slaves what you now see would neither excite your surprise nor your pity. It is not long since I saw a negro suspended from that very gibbet by the ribs. The following is the manner in which it was done : two incisions were made in his side in which was passed an iron hook attached to a chain. He lived three days suspended in that manner his head and feet hanging down licking from his bleeding breast the drops of water that fell on it for it rained at the time. The sufferer did not however utter a groan and never once complained. On the third day another negro was flogged under the gallows and having cried from pain the former reproached him for his want of courage: Are you a man? said he to him you behave like a child! – A moment afterwards the soldier who was sentry on the spot taking pity on him dashed out his brains with the butt end of his musquet. I saw another negro quartered the narrator: After his arms and legs were tied to four very strong horses an iron nail was driven under each nail of his hands and feet He suffered that without complaining requested a glass of ru and ordered the executioners to let loose the horses. But that which amused us most continued this monster was the humour of the fellow who when the hangman presented the glass of rum to him that he had asked for told him to drink first as he was very much afraid of bepoisoned and desired him to take care that his horses should not kick him. As for old negroes being broken on the wheel and young women burnt alive nothing is more common in this colony!  ID160,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,01,29,inform,Mr Birkbeck's Settlement A small pamphlet has lately been published consisting of letters and extracts of letters from Mr Birkbeck of which we have been procured a copy. The author's object appears chiefly to have been to counteract the misrepresentations circulated on the subject of the settlement by Cobbett. We read Cobbett's remarks when they were first transmitted to this country and certainly did not think them worthy of the notice here bestowed upon them. His objections to the new settlement helped out as they were misquotation and misconstruction were of very little weight except in so far as they applied to all emigration whatever ; and they had really nothing to render them worth reading but the sarcasm and caustic humour which accompanied them. We should therefore have been better pleased had Mr Birkbeck allowed this restless controversist to wallow in the mire of his own endless contradiction and rather given us some more details regarding the settlement. The Americans are every year pushing forward into the wilderness ; but it is a new thing for a body of our countrymen when withdrawing from a society richly provided with all the accomodations which wants of civilized life render necessary to pass through the settled and cultivated parts of the New World and to retire to the untrodden waste a thousand miles from the sea Though the activity of commerce carries many of the convenienes and even luxuries of life to this remote place still the settlers must find such a difference in their situation as must subject them to go many privations ; and some details shewing how the colonists got over their difficulties how their various wants were supplied and how the feelings and habits of civilized life accommodated themselves to the woods and the wilderness would have been much more interesting than a reply to Cobbett's captious objections. One of the most trying privations of the colony seems to be a want of wives an evil which happily does not affect the mother country amidst all her other sufferings. The evil has probably been aggravated by some of the colonists forgetting to take their wives with them. If matters don't get better in this particular we may expect to hear of some of the adjoining American towns suffering a Sabine spoliation. A cargo of young ladies would evidently be one of the best mercantile speculations ; and as our own city had surplus of ten or twelve thousand females at the last census we have no doubt that some of our enterprising export traders will take the hint and by scouring the boarding-schools complete a choice assortment adapted to the Illinois market. The following extracts the only parts that appear to have any general interest. English Prairie July 13. 1819. My Friends and Countrymen–For your service I exhibited in two publications an outline of the process of emigration from its commencement up to the final settlement. My first opinion of this the spot of our choice and the reasoning on which that choice was grounded are before you ; and sufficient time has elapsed to try those opinnions by the test of experience by which they are confirmed in every important particular. I showed you my own tract through the gloomy forest into a delightful country better prepared for an abode by the hand of nature than the heavy woods by half a century of labour. I built me a cabin and belayed a road to it; for it was my ambition to be surrounded by my old friends and neighbours. In this too I am gratified ; and we are contented with out allotment both as to our present state and future prospects. This small district which two years ago was nearly without inhabitants contains a thriving population of from six to seven hundred persons. We have been blessed with health most unusual for a new settlement or for any settlement of equal numbers in any country ; and no doubt is entertained by us or by any judicious observer of its salubrity. We have several wells of excellent water and many more are in progress. Our soil is fertile beyond my own expectation ; but our exertions have hitherto been chiefly directed to the permanent objects of building and fencing of which much has already been done. We have however collected a stock of hogs and cattle ; and I think acres of corn are now growing than there are indivi duals in the settlement. With regard to pecuniary success the capitalist is commencing his operations or looking around him undecided as to the course he shall pursue ; but the labourer has made an establishment. It is not with him as with the capitalist a state of hope merely from good prospects but of enjoyment from good possessions. Numbers of this class and of mechanics have already realized their little freeholds and are building cabins for themselves. The fruits of their labour are not squandered in dissipation and excess because they have highr objects ; and considering their former depressed condition it is astonishing to me as it is honourable to them that they betry no arrogance in their to independence. In the statements I have published I see little to correct as far as my observation and experience have now proceeded excepting that in my view of the profits of cultivation to early settlers I have not made sufficient allowance in time for the innumerable delays and disappointments inseparable from new undertakings in a new country. A year of preparatory and unproductive exertion should be added to the debtor-side of the account at the outset.  ID161,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,01,08,inform,Proceedings of the Court Lord Provost Manderston having been called to the Chair the Clerk Mr A. Boswell read a very distinct report of the results and general features of the transactions at the Infirmary and Queensberry House Hospital for the last year. The Lord Provost then named a Committee to examine the Treasurer's accounts &c. and report to the adjourned meeting to be held in February next. Mr John Witham junior then rose and requested leave to submit a few observations to the consideration of the Court. He stated in substance that though aware of its not being usual to vote thanks to the Managers until their accounts have been examined he was yet anxious to embrace the first opportunity of expressing his conviction that the exertions of the Managers had at last placed this valuable Institution on a most desirable footing. Although he had not visited the Hospital for the last twelve months he had not ceased to take an interest in its welfare ; and it was with great pleasure that he now stated that whether his inquiries were made of the medical attendants or of recent patients the answers were uniformly satisfactory. The Hospital was favoured with a good Matron between whom and the medical gentlemen the best understanding existed ; and the various salutary regulations of the Managers have led to such a prosperous state of things as justly to entitle them to the gratitude of this Court and the public. Still however he must say that although the Hospital was in a good state yet in his mind Visitors could not fall to afford that assistance to the Managers here and that security against internal abuses which they had done in so many other similar institutions. It was difficult to account for the prejudices which existed against this species of assistance in Edinburgh. At Leeds in addition to visitors of our sex there was a committee of ladies who visisted the female wards and from the joint labours of both classes of visitors many and great advantages had resulted. But in this city we had hospitals for females which are governed by men only without seeking any help from visitors of that sex who are much better qualified to discharge most of the duties. This view of these matters he trusted would yet be attended to.–He must also crave the attention of the meeting to another matter that of the L.11700 for which the city of Edinburgh pays only 4 1/2 per cent. He assured the Court and its Honoured Chairman that this subject was not introduced with the view of touching upon or insinuating any thing respecting the city's affairs. The money he understood was secured on the ale duty ; but why should the Hospital lose one-half per cent of interest? He had once made a calculation according to which the loss from the beginning had amounted to about L.10000. It had been stated that the Magistrates of Edinburgh had always been friendly to the Hospital ; but that was surely no reason for withholding L.59 of interest that whatever former Magistrates had thought on the subject the present would not submit to the idea of depriving the Hospital of any part of its lawful interest. If the ground on which the Hospital was built was alluded to it was plain that town had already got more by the reduced interest than its original value. The town of Edinburgh had also got L.8273 ; 17 ; 3 of invalid money from Government on condition of paying the interest to the Infirmary which inte- rest if paid at two terms in the years should be restricted to 3 1/2 per cent. And as the property tax–which the Town did not retain from the Hospital whether they did or did not pay it to Government–is now at an end he could see no reason for withholding the usual rate of interest. He concluded by suggesting the names of several gentlemen as a Committee to lend out the sum of L.11700 on interest at 5 per cent if the Magistrates of Edinburgh should decline to pay that rate of interest. Mr Alex. Cruishank seconded the motion Col. Crichton regretted that the respectable gentlemen should have introduced such a motion. He seldom visisted the Infirmary but when he sent patients to it ; but he could state that when his servants or workmen have been there from fever the attention they received was in every respect equal to what he and he hoped he was a respectable citizen could command in his own house. But he could mention the testimony of one whose authority was much higher than his own – that of a medical gentlemen of some eminence in his profession who lives abroad and who was recently in this country. That professional gentleman spoke the very highest terms both of the medical treatment and the economy of the House. It was matter of pride he said to every Scotsman to hear the manner in which the Infirmary of Edinburgh was spoke of in all the quarters of the globe. It was the pattern of all that was excellent in such institutions and a nursery of the most skilfull practitioners ; for go where we will the answer to almost every question put with respect to improved hospi tal treatment is that it was learned in the Infirmary of Edinburgh. Whether indeed we thought of these things ; whether we looked at the sublime inscriptions on the outside of the Hospital and the Christain doctrines and principles there inculcated or the treatement and management within we could not fail to be struck with admiration and without imputing any motives which he was not entitled to do he must say it would be much more creditable to the respectable gentlemen if they should confine themselves to expressing their high opinion of the institution and tanking the Managers instead of occupying the valuable time of this Honourable Court with quibbling about trifles which were every way contemptible. After a pause Col. Crichton made a counter motion to get rid of Mr Wigham's. Lord Meadowbank reminded the Court that this matter of interest had already been under the consideration of a Committee and decided on by the Court. Henry Jardine Esq. begged to mention a fact that the Town of Edinburgh had contributed L.50 to the Infirmary for the last year. Mr Ritchie rose and said that though perfectly aware of what the result would be he could not allow the matter to be settled without giving Mr Wigham's motion his support. It gave him much pleasure to find it was no longer unfashionable to allude to Christian doctrines in such meetings as this–a change from which he anticipated much good. He concurred in what had been said on this subject by the gentleman at the foot of the Table ; but he begged to remind him that it was a great principle of Christianity that nothing was too trifling to be attended to it it promised good; and the additional interest of the money in question would obviously extend the means of healing the sick the great object of the Institution. Nothing indeed which had fallen from that gentleman or the Learned Lord on the other side could meet or touch the simple proposition that five per cent is the legal rate of interest and that the Town of Edinburgh ought not to pay less. There was another subject alluded to by Mr Wigham on which if Mr W. did not he would submit a motion namely Visitori 'And this he conceived was the fittest time for appointing them. All sides of the house were now agreed that the Hospital was admirably conducted. It was impossible therefore to suppose that the measure was proposed from any distrust of the Managers. If the management was perfect now it was too much to expect it could continue so ; and this was the proper time for providing against the future. In other places the highest characters in the land had acted with visitors ; and much benefit had been derived from them in England and even at Glasgow. If human nature therefore was not different in Edinburgh from wht it is on the other side of the Tweed and in the west of Scotland it must be admitted that Visitors would be beneficial here also. Besides as the Managers were aware of their strength and that no measure could be carried here without their consent the granting of Visitors would be a boon from themselves. He moved that this Court do annually name 24 or more Visitors to act monthly by rotation and minute such observations as shall occur to them for the consideration of the Managers. Mr Wigham seconded the motion ; but as the Court seemed averse to entertain it it was withdrawn. Mr Ritchie then said that as his last motion was intended chiefly as a caveat to the Committee named by the Lord Provost he would also with the same view state the nature of a motion which he wished to submit but the merits of which he was not then fully prepared to state. it was one however of which he was sure it would not be said that it was introduced for the purpose of giving trouble or unnecessarily occupying the time of the Court. Its object was the promotion of medical science and its nature would be understood by his reading a single paragraph from the able Clinical Reports of Dr Duncan junior. Almost all hospitals (it is there stated) publish annual Reports; but in many cases they are intended only to furnish information as to the expenditure of the funds and the names of the office-bearers and as a public acknowledgement of the support of the subscribers. Such reports however are of no use in marking the progress of disease and except for purposes mentioned above do positive harm by causing hospital reports in general to be neglected as utterly without value. This however is not the case ; and the reports we have of late years received from the Fever Hospitals of Dublin and Cork are worthy of being imitated by hospitals of every kind and in every place. Indeed the public have a right to expect this information in return for their liberality in supporting them. We have only to add that the most valuable reports often proceed entirely from the zeal of the reporters and are only occasional. This leads us to suggest that the governors of hospitals should enjoin their regular as a duty upon their medical officers ; and we will venture to say that where it has not yet been practised its good effects upon the institution in an economical as well as professional points of view will soon be apparent.–His motion went to carry this suggestion into effect ; and without farther preface he should now read it. The substance of it was that in addition to the Journal kept at present Digest of the whole should be kept in a tabular form but especially of the date of admission age sex and place of residence of the patients ; date of commencement crisis termination and assigned causes of their diseases ; with a diary of the temperatures and moisture of the atmosphere state of winds prices of staple provisions &c. ; with an annual medical report taking notice of the increase or decrease of population and of the employment diet and habits of the labouring classes as far as practicable. Some of the members he observed seemed to be amused with this enumeration ; but the medical gentlemen would be aware of what he pointed at. With their peculiar and proper duties he had no wish to interfere. They knew them well and discharged them faithfully and honourably. In their practise they attended to every thing that was necessary ; but their knowledge often died with him ; and his object was to preserve the results of their skill and experience. The Lord President said he hoped the gentlemen who had made this motion would see on reflection from the labour and time requisite to carry it into effect how very impracticable it would be in an hospital like that of the Royal Infirmary where the Managers had no compulsory authority over the medical gentlemen whose time was so occupied with their own private avocations. The Proposer of the motion said that instead answering what had fallen from the Right Honourable Judge in his own language he would beg leave to read another passage from Dr Duncan's voluble publication and which he hoped would obviate some of the difficulties adverted to. The trouble (says Dr Duncan) of keeping such tabular records is not so great as might be supposed. It requires only system and regularity; and when we see how easily it is done in the military hospital we cannot help regretting that it is not also in- troduced general into civil hospitals. If the practitioner himself has not time to fill up the columns of the prescribed table it would be very little additional trouble to his clerk ; or if the time of that assistant would not easily permit him the duty would be very gladly taken by another of the Hospital pupils. Dr Hope in a neat and eloquent speech opposed the motion. The Managers he said were willing to give due consideration to every proposal from whatever quarter it might come. The present however he considered as impractiable. To prepare tabular records of the nature suggested required great experience much comprehension and many talents. It was a task which every one was not qualified to discharge in a mnner could be beneficial to the public and one which gentlemen who lived by their profession could not be expected to undertake. The case was different in military hospitals where the medical getlmen could devote the whole of their time to their hospital duties. But it should be know that the materials for making up such tables are all recorded in the infirmary Journals ; and that these Journals are open to all the medical attendants; so that whoever finds that he has time and talents for the performance of such tasks has the fullest opportunity for undertaking and completing them. Accordingly we had had the very able reports of Dr Duncan and the useful work of Dr Welsh. The Institution has now the benefit of Dr Duncan's services ; and he considered it better to leave the completion of such works and reports to the zeal and talents of individuals. The Mover then stated that he was perfectly aware of Dr. Welsh's judicious publication as well as Dr Duncan's and he certainly would never have introduced such a measure had it not been suggested and recommended by a much abler mind than his own. He had not undertaken the task from any idea that he was able to do it justice or that he could do it better or even so well as many other members of the Court ; but from the conviction that if he had not introduced the subject it would be introduced at all. He had no wish however to give unnecessary trouble and should therefore for the present beg leave to withdraw his motion. Form of Process in the Justiciary Court. Our readers will learn with pleasure that the Lord Advocate with a laudable anxiety for the honour of our criminal jurisprudence has announced officially that the Clerk of Court strikes the Jury by taking 45 after 45 until they served in rotation. They consist of a list of Jurymen furnished by the High Constables for Edinburgh and those regularly required from the counties of Linlithgow and Haddington which names were then put upon a roll which was put into the bands of the Clerk of Court;– the Jurors thus struck being cited not by a Sheriff officer but by a Macer of the Justiciary ourt. We are not aware of any law which requires the Clerk of Court to take the Jurors by rotation ; but it reflects great credit on his judgement that he resorts to this unequivocal mode of displaying his impartiality. This is a virtue which the law requires in all its officers ; and it is fortunate when such rules are devised and adhered to as make the virtue incontrovertibly visible. At such an advanced stage of society honour and public opinion will secure impartial justice ; but still when the possibility of some retrograde movement is adverted to it would be a wise measure to convert what all functionaries do at present from principle into specific rules for directing the conduct of their successors. The Lord Advocate it has been reported is about to introduce into Parliament a Bill or Bills respecting the Judicatories of Scotland ; and his Lordship it is obvious might obtain a well-merited popularity by throwing in some clauses to fix the qualifications of a Juror in the different counties of Scotland and to regulate the times and the manner in which lists of Jurors are to be made up reduced into a penl of 45 and then to a jury of 15. Ther is if we mistake not a cerain discretion on more than one of these points left with functionaries who we doubt not would most readily part with it. To them it would be a relief ; and though the arraigned might sometimes have less impartial juries than at present yet if the ballot were introduced here as it has recently been in civil cases the impartiality would be more coguisable and placed beyond the reach of doubt and misrepresentation. It would be no disgrace to Scotland to borrow in this respect from her sister kingdom but an honour which France seems willing to do herself at present and which we very lately did ourselves in modelling our Jury Court. Mr Bywater has construced a small model of a ship in such a manner as to exhibity by actual experiment the principal magnetic phenomena mentioned by Captain Flinders in his voyage to New Holland. From a minute attention to the subject Mr B. has devised a plan which in all probability will remedy by very simple means the defect arising from the local attraction pointed out by Captain Flinders and thus be of real advantage to the science of navigation. A drawing of this plan (as it will be important to ships of war) has been sent to the Admiralty.  ID162,Glasgow Herald,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,04,24,inform,Upper Canada Extract from A Visit to the Province of Upper Canada in 1819 By James Strachan. [?] the Stream of Emigration now chiefly to the United States and not to Canada. The greater number are decieved; they know no[?] of this country.

We shall suppose the persons emigrating to be friends to the British constitution; for if they are not there is no question; because levellers and democrats will find themselves in a bad situation in coming to Canada as they will find no kindred spirits there. But though we can willingly spare such as these to lose good subjects is a serious evil to the empire; and to lose them through ignorance and the want of that information which it is in our power to give is a folly as well as all evil. I am persuaded that all emigrants of the description we mention would rather prefer to remain undue their own government than to live under and swear allegiances to another provided no greater sacrifices were required in going to the one than to the other. I am indeed quite certain that many would consent willing to a considerable sacrifice for this advantage so agreeable to their feelings and habits; but we shall shew that no such sacrifice is required and that their interest as well as inclination when duly considerd will lead them to Upper Canada. In going to the United States we have Mr. Birkbeck's authority that 'no good settlement can be made cast of the Alleghany mountains or in the Atlantic States.' The lands are now so dear as to be in general far beyond the reach of common emigrants who have seldom much left after landing in America. Suppose two families to land in America–one at New York or Philadelphia on the way to Mr Birkbeck's settlement; and one at Quebec on the way to Upper Canada. Miles From Philadelphia to Pittsburgh 320 From Pittsburgh down the Ohio to Shawanoe Town 1200 From Shawanoe Town to Mr Birkbeck's settlement 50 1570 Expense of a family travelling this route supposing the family to consist of ten persons and to carry with them two tons of goods: Dollars.

These prices taken from Mr. Birkbeck's book are t50 per cent above the truth. From this table it is manifest that the produce raised in Upper Canada sells at an advance of upwards of 30 per cent on what the same can be sold in the Illinois territory supposing Mr. Birkbeck's prices correct which they are not being much too high. The vast advantage therefore in coming to Upper Canada must appear manifest. It may by some be said that the families are too numerous as there are few that consist of ten persons; but the results will be proportionally the same whatever the number be; and if we suppose them to consist of persons in comfortable circumstances in their own country they will commonly bring servants with them by which the average will be still greater. But this is of no moment; the difference of expense in travelling 500 miles or 1570 is suf ficiently clear. We must add to the disadvantage of Mr. Birkbeck's farmer the dearness of all those articles which he has to purchase; for his distance from the seacoast and market operates in two ways to his disadvantage. 'His produce is low and the goods from are dear: the shopkeeper who is at a great distance from the place where the articles he deals in are procured will add to the price when he disposes of the the additional expense of bringing and the time lost in procuring them. To him who is obliged to take a journey of 1600 miles to procure his articles of merchandize the cost and trouble must be very great; and all this he makes the consumer pay. The journey which Mr. Birkbeck's merchant is obliged to take is a very serious one compared to that of the merchant of York or Niagara. The latter in consequence of this situation can trade with a smaller capital than the former; because he can at any time procure a fresh supply in a few days while the former can lay in a stock of goods only once a-year. Now all these difficulties are to be paid for by the farmers and mechanics who consume the articles imported; the difference to them in the course of a twelvemonth by receiving less for the articles they sell and paying more for those they purchase will be found to be very great. 'It is not merely the quantum he shall raise but the sun he shall get for it which constitutes the farmer's advantage. It is not simply to get enough to eat and drink that is to bound the desires of the farmer; it is to procure the means of converting his log-cabin into a handsome and convenient house– to erect a large barn for his grain and suitable buildings for his cattle–to educate his children–and as he grows old to enjoy the satisfaction of finding that his industry has supplied the comforts of life and enabled him to satisfy the wants of society– wants to which we are indebted for amelioration of mankind.' In the selection of a place to residence in a new country it is very important to take into view the ultimate market for the farmer's produce. While the country is settling there will be no difficulty; for the increasing population will demand all the supplies that can be raised. But the prudent settler will look beyond that period and consider what he shall do when every one raises more grain than he will be able to consume. In that case vicinity to market and facility of transportation are all important. Now the produce of Upper Canada can be sent to Montreal one of the best markets in America in five or six days at a trifling expense which is yearly diminishing as the waters are improved. Very different is the case with the farmer in the western division of the United States: the immense distance which grain has to be sent occasions the expense to be so great as frequently to equal and sometimes exceed the price offered when it reaches the market. The more that this statement is examined the more correct it will be found and the superior advantages of Canada will appear in a stronger light; but having been a landholder it is time to instruct the emigrant how he is to make his living out of it.  ID163,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,04,24,inform,Emigration Among the emigrants proceeding to seek another country on the shores of Southern Africa four vessels containing above 600 souls have sailed from Liverpool bound to the Cape of Good Hope; three of them under the command and direction of a naval officer and one under private superintendance.

But the most gloomy anticipations of those who were most inclined to view the picture on the dark side have certainly come infinitely short of the full measure of distress and misery which have at length fallen upon the country. It would be unjust to charge the Government with any more of these evils than might have been foreseen ; but now that they force themselves on the attention on all sides it is perfectly fair to hold the Government accountable for all that it can remove or prevent and yet suffers to exist. This is the first time we believe in modern history when the evil of an excess of population has come so distinctly under the notice of a Government as to call for a legislative remedy. The case is therefore new and the course to be pursued is the less obvious ; but the war was a season of bold experiments in which we surmounted many difficulties once deemed insuperable : and if timidity tie up our hands now when humanity calls upon us to move the world may well say that the boasted energy of the Government has been entirely reserved for the supply of its own wants out of the pockets of the people but that when a period of public calamity requiress exertions of a more painful kind it is startled by the smallest difficulty and will not even make such a slight effort as might evince its sympathy with the sufferers. During the late war the industry of the country was stimulated into a state of unprecedented activity by the monopoly we obtained of the commerce of the world–by thirty or forty millions of the capital of the country being annually melted down and consumed–and by the continual rise of prices produced by the depreciation of the currency. The great demand for labour arising out of this state of things with the consequent increase of wages caused a rapid augmentation in the numbers of the people. In the ten years ending 1811 the rate of increase in Britain was such as would have doubled the population in fifty-two years; and in the great manufacturing districts it probably equalled what takes place in a new colony. When the peace came and was followed by the destruction of our commercial monopoly the cessation of the annual loans and the diminuition of the paper issues the sources of our fictitious prosperity were dried up at once : a vast reduction took place in the demand for labour ; profits and wages fell with prices ; while the pressure of the taxes were doubled and onethird added to their real amount by the rise in the value of money. The laws however which regulate the multiplication of human beings cannot instantly bend to circumstances : a long period necessarily elapses before the population accommodates itself to the diminished demand for labour and during this period the labouring classes must suffe extreme misery. In this state we are at present and time from which we hoped relief has only aggravated the evil. There are but three remedies upon which any dependence can be placed – a reduction of taxation – a change in our commercial system – and emigration. We have little hopes as to the first since this would require a sacrifice on the part of the Government of its own interest real or supposed which we see no disposition to make. A relaxation in our restrictive commercial system has not the same obstacles to encounter and we have repeated shewn that it would be highly beneficial. The reluctance of Ministers to attempt a change that may prejudice the interest of some particular classes might be considered as a prudent caution were it not observed that when instead of relieving the distress of the people the object is to suppy the necessities of the Treasury none of this caution appears but the complaints of the sufferers are disregarded as vulgar clamour. But the crisis is now such that tenderness to the interests of a few individuals may be cruelty to the public at large. Though we shall preach free trade to other nations rather with a bad grace when we can no longer hold our monopoly it is so far well that our misfortunes are at last likely to open our eyes to truths whch were familiar to philosophers half a century ago. In our present circumstances we may perhaps almost be thankful that a systematic error which has impeded our career has kept this one resource open to us. Emigration suggests itself so naturally as a remedy for a redundant population that we are rather surprised there should be much reluctance to have recourse to it. We need not be afraid that the practise will continue longer than the necessity which produces it. The vis intertiae of people in general says Malthus and their attachment to their homes are qualities so strong and general that we may rest assured they will not emigrate unless from political discontents or extreme poverty they are in such a state as will make it as much for the advantages of their country as of themselves that they should go out of it. We by no means underrate the difficulties that attend emigration upon a large scale but these are partly occasioned by the absurd practise of directing it exclusively to our own colonies. We have vast multitudes whom we can neither feed nor employ ; and surely the first and most pressing object is to send them where they will find the means of subsistence. There are many parts of the world besides our own colonies open to receive them. And whether they go to the United States Brazil Buenos Ayres or to Canada New Holland or the Cape of Good Hope the advantage to this country will be nearly the same. Among so many countries of such extent it would not be very difficult to dispose of half a million of persons (young and old) within the course perhaps of two years. But upon whatever scale emigration is conducted it must be gradual; and this renders it the more important to fix upon a plan early. Ministers have lately announced that Canada cannot receive more emigrants at present without inconvenience. But had the intention of sending great numbers to that colony been made public two years ago corn would have been raised for them and men of some capital assured of finding abundance of labourers would have gone out and settled and provided employment for those who have not the means to establish themselves as farmers. The alarm we feel of seeing manufactures raised up in other countries by the skill of our expatriated artisans is very ill founded. Many other advantges must be combined with the possession of mechanical skill to make manufactures flourish ; and when the former are found able workmen will not be long wanting. Our capital our improved means of internal communication our coal fields our laws for the protection of industry and property the free enlightened and active spirit of our people with the powers of combination resulting from the union of so many advantages within so small a space are better securities for our superiority in manufactures than attempts which must be nugatory to retain a monopoly of operative skill and talent. But the opinion which exists in foreign countries as to the superiority of our people in every branch of industry will have this good effect that it will secure out emigrants a favourable reception. Though the emigration to afford any sensible relief to the whole country would require to be upon an extensive scale it is yet obvious that even upon the smallest scale it is beneficial. If six labourers are withdrawn from a small village or fifty from a country town the situation of either will be improved. The plan hitherto acted on by Government of givingassistance to those only who could raise ten on fifteen pounds is chiefly objectionable because it must restrict the emigration within very narrow limits. If by sending away men who are still able to subsist by their labour others now living on charity get employment we are in effect relieved of so many paupers. But the former are less disposed to leave the country ; and with regard to those who are or must soon become paupers it will certainly be found more economical to pay ten or fiften pounds each to send them abroad than to maintain them permanently home. It is in vain however to look to private charity for the funds necessary for such an undertaking. These must be raised by the country at large ; and whether a tax be imposed for the special purpose or money destined for other objects be applied to this the country we have no doubt is ready to make the sacrifice. Suppose that even so great a sum as five millions were required this is but the half of what England alone pays every year for poor rates ; and what is such a sum if it were to afford certain relief on an emergency lke the present? If the French and Dutch should again disagree about the navigation of the Scheldt or if we should quarrel with the French or Americans about the traffic in a few hundred wild cat-skins on the other side of the globe how easily would a sum ten times as large be found? Nothing more is requisite than to take on half of the sum for two years which Mr Vansittart allots for paying off the national debt. We not only conceive that it would be wise and creditable to divert a part or the whole of the actual Sinking Fund to this purpose ; but we go so far as to think that it is little less than disgraceful to pay off any debt at all at this crisis with funds wrung from the earnings of a starving population. Whatever is done it is of vast importance to understand that the most pressing evil though not absolutely permanent in its nature cannot be expected to subside of itself for many years. We have not only an excess of population to dispose of but we have to check the principle of increase which is rapidly aggravating the evil. In the five years ending 1810 the population of England added one-seventieth part to its numbers annually ; and if we suppose the ratio to have been the same for the whole empire each year must have had 250000 individuals more to provide for than the preceding. Till the whole of this vast annual inrease is got rid of the present excess of numbers will not diminish but augment. And how is it to be got rid of? Either the annual births must diminish more than one-third or famine and disease must destroy a quarter of a million of human beings annually beyond the usual rate of mortality or these two causes must operate together. Notwithstanding therefore the misery of the labouring classes at this moment we doubt whether the population is not still on the increase and whether still more afflicting scenes are not awaiting us. Indeed unless measures are taken to do away the factitious stimulus which the English poorlaws give to the increase of population the most abundant e migration will prove but a feeble palliative. These are rather discouraging circumstances ; but the evil must be dealt with in some way or it will ultimately overwhelm us. It has now become rather a question of humanitiy than of policy. One or two millions of human beings have been suddenly deprived of their means of subsistence by events over which they had no control. With such a mass of individuals goaded to desperation by want–a deficient crop–a sudden revulsion in trade– a more general exclusion of our manufactures by the Americans–any of those numerous casualties in short to which every nation is exposed would place us in a situation frightful to contemplate. Plots and insurrections will keep up a continual alarm. Neither persons nor property will be safe and capital will gradually leave the country. If theory were silent experience must now convince us that time alone will produce no material amelioration in our circumstances ; and the relief which is may ultimately bring will be obtained only through the destruction of vast multitudes by famine and disease. In the fifth year of peace it is now time to look the evil in the face and either to make some great sacrifices for its removal or to brace our minds to bear the dreadful alternative. It is in vain to disguise the matter to our own consciences. Those who propose to leave things to what they call the course of nature are in substance recommending that thousands of their fellow-creatures should be suffered to rot away from the effect of absolute want.

The whole of the freemasons of Halifax went in grand procession. They formed in lodges at their hall and preceded by a military band and followed by another they marched to the places prepared for them on the building. His Lordship came on the scaffolding at two o'clock the grenadiers of the 62d regiment being his guard of honour. Detachments from each regiment kept the ground. After a prayer by the Rev. Mr Twining Grand Chaplain Lord Dalhousie addressed the assembly in a speech of which I have not time to give an outline ; but in it his Lordship mentioned that the building was intendeed as a college upon the plan of that of Edinburgh where all students who professed the Christian religion were eligible for admittance. Strangers residing here for a short time might also enjoy the benefit of the institution and gentlemen in the army the navy and the military establishments. His Lordship concluded a most eloquent and animated address with his fervent wishes for the welfare and prosperity of the undertaking. A bottle with coins and a tin case with parchments &c. were then severally deposited in the recess made for them and the stone was lowered into its place with all the requisite and due forms under a royal salute from fort Charlotte ; after which the Rev. the Grand Chaplain closed the proceedings with a prayer and the whole assembled multitude gave nine cheers.– The military and masonic processions then returned in the same order in which they came. The day was beautiful and a greater assemblage of people was never witnessed in Halifax. The Countess of Dalhousie and her two sons Mrs Admiral Griffith and the Misses Wilson and most of the fashionable ladies here witnessed the ceremony from a convenient scaffolding prepared for them. Lord Dalhousie purposes to leave Halifax for Quebec in his Majesty's ship Newcastle on the 1st of June without waiting for Sir James Kempt. Court of Chancery –June 10. Will of the Late Duke of Queensberry Mr Head stated that he had to present a petition from the annuitants and legates of the late Duke of Queensberry praying that a fourth more of their claims might be paid there now being sufficient funds in the hands of the Accountant-General for that purposes. The Learned Counsel said that there was no less a sum than L.1400000 accumulated and vested in the name of this officer in Bank stock for the benefit of the claimants and he understood it was not intended to oppose the application although the executors did not say they would give their consent to it. Some consultation had been had on the subject out of doors ; he therefore prayed that the prayer of the petition should be granted. The Attorney-General said he had not received any instructions nor had he been consulted. The several King's counsel in Court spoke in behalf of their respective clients. Mr Wingfield appeared for the Earl of Yarmouth and said his Lordship was anxious that the business should be put in a train of settlement. The Lord Chancellor said there was not a man existing that had a heart in him but must wish the legacies and annuities to be paid ; but said his Lordship the Marquis of Queensberry has commenced an action for the recovery of L.150000 against the executor and he certainly had a right so to do it ; it was therefore proper that the Court should see that no harm arose to the executors before the funds were allowed to go out of Court. With respect to their not opposing the petition that was very different to consenting to it ; it merely said to the Court Mind you do right. Mr Heald said if his Lordship thought that one-fourth was too much they would take an eight or any part his Lordship pleased. The Lord Chancellor.–I will order it to stand first on the paper for Tuesday next and in the mean time I will look over the petition.  ID167,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,07,01,inform,The New York Daily Advertiser says–The line of battle ship New York now finishing at our navy yard at the Wallabut is perhaps the most superior vessel ever built.

I have thank God no very brilliant events to communicate to you but if the happiness of man is the legitimate object of all Government it is good to learn that British India is at peace and that a temperate and radical reform is gradually going on under the Marquess of Hastings' administration. The establishment of schools and a free press are the moving principles by which this great advancement in the state of society will be accomplished unless checked by impious powers. On the subject of these schools it is not necessary here to dilate. Suffice it to observe that it is in the power of any Government abitrary or free to educate the great bulk of its subjects and thereby to advance them in knowledge civilization and happiness in the shortest possible period. The establishment of a free press in Asia is in my estimation as useful and magnanimous an art as ever adorned the biography of any Statesman. What say its detractors is setting loose a parcel of printer's devils so great an act? No but setting loose all the intelligence of the age to work upon the public mind and conduct is an act of unrivalled benevolence. Be it asserted that a free press is only applicable to an advanced state of society I deny the position ; it is not founded in reason or experience. I contend on the other hand that where least knowledge and msot evil exist there is the greatest scope for improvement ; and I offer Scotland as a proof of the efficacy[?] of education and a free press. The Marquess of Hastings Governor General of India has in the newspapers of Madras and Calcutta been accused of having sent two persons of the name of Hastings to unhealthy climates the one to the East and the other to the West Indies where they died ; and for the base purpose of securing to his family the title of Huntingdon. This you must be aware was touching his sensitive honour to the quick ; and it would seem as if some one inimical to a free press had introduced the paragraph to irritate him. But this virtuous man who would not tread on an insect allowed this shameful slander to pass unnoticed. It stood refuted in every bosom and his manly forbearance tended but to give further proofs of his attachment to our infant liberty. Attacks have likewise been made on Sir E. East our Chief Justice. He complained they say of these alleged libels to the Chief Magistrate who desired him to have recourse to the law Conceive not however that I am the advocate for a licentious press. My maxim is that a great power when mischievously applied must be hurtful and when well applied beneficial in proportion to its strength. You will rejoice to learn that Mr Elphinstone Governor of Bombay has done away with the Censorship of the Press. This wise Statesman being a friend to freedom and having experienced the benefits which had arisen in Bengal from the measure (for scarce a day no passes that some abuse is not brought to light by the press) adopted it the moment he came into power and thus proved himself a public benefactor. To conclude it is my firm conviction that the diffusion of knowledge through the medium of education and a free press will more than any other measure accelerate the improvement and heighten the prosperity not only of British India but of the surrounding world.  ID170,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,07,12,inform,Colonial Intelligence Proposed New Monarchy in South America Accounts have beenreceived from Buenos Ayres by the Blossom sloop of War of a curious nature.– They relate to a project said to have been in agitation for placing a Prince of the House of Bourbon at the head of an independent Sovereignty on the River Plate.– The circumstance has been brought to light by the late changes in the Government of Buenos Ayres. From the documents now published and received by the Blossom it appears that in June 1819. Gomez the Envoy from Buenos Ayres at Paris was invited to a conference by M. De Cazes then French Minister for Foreign Affairs the object of which was to communicate a project of the French Cabinet for the colonsolidation of the Independent Government of South America. This project the French Minister observed would meet with the decided approbation of the Continental Powers especially Russia and Austria. Great Britain might not like it but yet would not find any good pretence for resisting it ; and his Catholic Majesty would yield to the influence of all Europe with the better grace as his former dependencies would be only transferred to a branch of his own family. The King of France would furnish assistance of every king and employ every means even to the supply of troops for carrying the affair into execution. On the 26th of October last when the statement of his conference reached Buenos Ayres Rondeau then Director ad interim made a secret communication to the Congress and transmitted to them the letter of the Envoy together with the French memorial ; on the following day and on the 3d of November the matter was discussed in secret meetings and the result was an[?] opinion that the Constitution lately-sworn allowed no alteration to be made in the form of Government till after the meeting of the Chambers. That a branch of the Bourbon family so closely connected with the reigning Monarch of Spain was in itself an insuperable objection as also the consideration that the Prince proposed and supported by the Powers of the European Continent would naturally more incline towards the views of his protectors than towards those of South America which ought to avoid all connexion with European continental politics ; and that Great Britain was the power from which South America had most to fear and most to expect. It was at the same time suggested that the Envoys in Europe shoud put the communications from Paris into the hands of the British Minstry whose good opinion and protection South America is most anxious to conciliate. Our Cabinet has always treated the South Americans with the greatest reserve as if feating contamination by simple contact–a delicacy towards Spanish interests and feelings which appears in itself commendable but when measured by the standard of national benefit may not merit the same praise. As it is it would seem that the British interest is likely to gain the ascendacy in the river Plate rather through the disposition of the inhabitants than from any influence exerted by our Ministers. We shall only add that thought the negotiation was carried on by the Duke de Cazes the project did not originate with him and did not at first apply to the Prince de Lucca. It was intended as an opening for one more nearly allied to the reigning family in France.  ID171,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,07,19,inform,Emigration. We extract the following statement from the Montreal Herald and an important one it is to those who are desirous of emigrating as well as to those who from patriotic motives would wish to turn the tide of emigration into a channel which while it relieve the mother country now may hereafter add to her strength and resources : Number of British subjects that emigrated to the United States who received recommendations for grants of land and removed to the province of Upper Canada from James Buchanan Esq. his Majesty's Consul at New York in the year 1819 : – English { Farmers..... 180 Women..... 118 Children..... 157 Mechanics..... 117 Women..... 57 Children..... 92 } 1021 Scotch { Farmers..... 50 Women..... 11 Children..... 15 Mechanics..... 30 Women..... 9 Children..... 36 } 131 Irish { Farmers..... 184 Women..... 94 Children..... 319 Mechanics..... 75 Women..... 42 Children..... 98 } 810 Total.........1962 We cannot give publicity to the above return without observing how eminently calculated such a document is to open the eyes of our too credulous yet industrious and loyal countrymen ; many of whom are still disposed to look to the United Statesm as the abode of independence and the source of affluence. Here we see nearly 2000 British subjects who in one season through the agency alone of one of our Consuls(withoutany pecuniary aid) have removed from the United States to Upper Canada. Their trieal and failure in the former as well as the trial and failure of the great numbers who have returned to this country are circumstances well calculated to direct the attention of those who have emigration in view at once to Upper Canada. We have made enquiry about these hitherto unknown but truly fertile regions ; and we are informed from a most authentic and satisfactory source that there there are unlocated lands fertile beyond the conception of those who have not seen them capable of receiving ten millions of inhabitants ; that the winters are not so cold nor the summers so hot as in the State of New York ; that these regions have proved eminently healthy to the vast numbers that have poured into them of late years ; and that the administration of the laws the state of education and religious instruction and above all the peace and quiet of the inhabitants have found there have exceed their most sanguine expectations. It may be desirable to state that grown persons can get by water from Quebec to York the capital of Upper Canada for about 28s ; children half price ; that to all persons properly recommended as to good conduct a grant of land is given according to their means of cultivation ; that this grant becomes their own for ever and they may dispose of it as they please.  ID172,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,08,02,inform,Colony at the Cape of Good Hope (Extract of a Letter dated off Madeira ) Aurora Transport Ship Feb 19. An opportunity having offered for transmitting a hasty account of the Aurora and Brilliant transports proceeding with settlers to the Cape of Good Hope I feel happy in availing myself of that circumstance with a view as well to gratify our friends in England as to add another confirmation of the liberality of Government in our important undertaking. First it will be necessary to state that the two ships sail in company and are every day within hail of each other ; the former commanded by Captain Pearson and the latter by Captain Bothwell who is accompanied by Lieutenant Pritchard as agent to both vessels. We sailed from Gravesend on. Our course down Channel was most favourable and the weather has hitherto been propitious. No death disease or serious accident has occurred in either ship and blooming health and vigour now rapidly succeed the langour produced by a sudden transition to a new element. Provisions consisting of flour currants suet[?] oatmeal peas butter cheese tea sugar biscuit salt pork and beef of excellent quality are liberally supplied together with a proper allowance of rum vinegar mustard and spices. The ships are fitted up in every respect comfortably and commodiously and the most perfect harmony prevails if we except bickerings amongst the old women about fractured teapots and mislaid culinary articles. The attention paid to the comfort of the passengers and more especially to that of the women and children by the Captains and the agent (Mr Pritchard) is highly creditable to the instructions received from Government. Although I do not sail in the same ship Captain Bothwell. I have had ample proofs of the kindness and humane liberality which he shews to the passengers in the Brilliant. Captain Pearson is an active intelligent officer who has been 23 years in the Transport Service under Government : he has sailed to almost every part of the world and Algoa Bay our place of destination is quite familiar to him. It may be egotism to speak of myself; but I trust I may be excused in boasting that of the crew and 240 passengers not one is seriously indisposed at present and wishing with heartfelt sincerity to my friends in England happiness peace and tranquility in as good health as I now enjoy long may they live long live the Constitution: and while on Fish River or Orange River we encounter the difficulties incident to new colonists may England and South Africa be ever united by the ties of mutual friendship–the one affording her parental arms and the other mindful of her filial duty.

His Excellency the Governor Sir R. S. Donkin was taking some effectual measures to place the coinage of the colony upon a better footing and on the 13th of October he issued a Proclamation for destroying a very large quantity of base money. He has also taken measure to communicate to the new settlers from England the full benefit ofthe Courts of Justice esblished in that quarter of the world. We have received an account of the loss of the Abeona[?] transport bound to the Cape of Good Hope with settlers. The following is an extract of a letter from the Agent to Lloyd's dated Lisbon 20th Dec. The Condessa da Ponte which arrived on the 20th inst. from Marenham[?] has brought 49 persons who escaped from the Abeona transport bound to the Cape of Good Hope which took fire and was burnt on the 25th ult. in lat. 5 N. long–and 113 lives were lost. The Agent Lieut. Madge the Captain Surgeon 21 men 16 boys 4 women and 5 girls got into three boats and fortunately fell in with the Condessa da Ponte the morning after the fatal event. Demerara Gazettes to a late date have been received which give detailed accounts of the number and state of the slaves in that part of the West Indies. The report is given by James Robertson Esq. the new Slave Registrat of the United Colony. It is a triennial statement of the slave population and the Reporter makes some judicious comparative remarks. It appears that there has been a large decrease of the number by deaths but the Creoles are greatly increased as compared with the former year. Births have been in the proportion of one to forty-six. The Report defends the [?] of the West India Planters and observes that the state of the Black population serves[?] to evil for little or no [?] ; so great is the kindness the liberality and induglent care of propiertors. It adds that their own interests is a perpetual[?] evil[?] upon their humanity.

While I was seeing the last of your goods on board last night a vessel arrived in the harbour having on board an officer from Cutch who was the hearer of the official intelligence of the complete success of Sir Charles Culville's expedition against the Sindeans. The expedition consisted of 12000 men commanded by his Excellency the Commander in Chief ; from all I could clean of intellience from the followers it appeared there had been some hard fighting for five days ; but it ended as might be anticipated from the imposing force sent against the Sindeans. The moment the officer (who is one of the Staff and an Irishman) landed he set out for the Government House to inform Lady Colville of the event as it must be supposed she was in a state og anxiety her husband being the commander and her brother and her uncle Colonel T. Blair being also on the expedition. At day-light this morning orders arrived from the Government House to secure a passage and private cabin for the officer in th ship which takes this to England but there was no such accomodation as the cabins were all full ; and as another vessel will not sail from thence about ten days this and will be off to-day the chance is you will have this letter at least six weeks before the officers can reach England with the official intelligence. All kinds of European produce are a drug hee paricularly fine goods ; and rum brandy and geneva are for a song. The cholera has rather abated but still rages in a frightful manner. The Rio Janeiro packet arrived on Tuesday with letters to the 21st of November. Advices had been received from Rio Grande stating that Artigas had been taken prisoner. The Portuguese frigate Union had captured two insurgent privateers which had been committing depredations on the coast. The events in Portugal owing to which as well as to the idea that the King would be prudent enough to sanction what had taken place in Portugal the prices of produce had experienced very trifling alteration though if the contrary should be the case a considerable rise was anticipated. The following relates to what is passing in Peru :– Extract of a letter from Rio Janeiro dated November 20 :– The Chilians have at length carried into effect their boasted expedition which left Valparaiso on the 21st August and arrived at Pisco at the beginning of September. San Martin landed 4500 men but the blacks cattle &c. had all been previously sent away from the estates in that quarter so that they will be disappointed in meeting with partisans ; indeed the slaves and lower orders whom they expected to find favourable to their views are the most irritated against the insurgents. We have letters from Lima to the 12th September which speaks of the little apprehensions entertained of San Martin and his troops the Viceroy having a formidable force in the capital and vicinity of 8000 men commanded by good officers. The Viceroy is Commander-in-Chief La Serna second and La Mar and O'Reilly command divisions. They were observin San Martin's movements who already experienced the difficulties of subsisting his men. The Marquis of Vallembrozo was on his flank with a strong detachment of cavalry with a view to prevent him from sending emissaries into the interior and collecting horses. It is thought the insurgents will soon have to re-embark ; for as soon as they are a little pressed for provisions and fighting comes on numbers will desert. Those who have already come over describe their situation as very critical. Two vessels one an English and the other a French were preparing to sail from Callao for this place and by them we shall receive further particulars. The most enthusiastic preparations were making in Lima to proclaim the constitution in a formal manner for which purpose orders had been received from Madrid. This of itself is sufficient to defeat all views Cochrane and San Martin may have on the country except as before a little plunder on the open and defenceless parts of the coast. Letters from Sierra Leone dated the 24th of Nov. mention that the whole squadron was lying there.– The Pheasant Myrmidon Snapper and Thistle were lying off the Cape waiting for the Morgiana to complete her water provisions &c. which ship was obliged to be assisted by the squadron in consequence of her very sickly state. She had recently arrived from the River Gambia whither she had proceeded in dread of attack by the natives on our infant colony there. A letter of thanks had been voted to Captain Finlason by the merchants of that colony for the very able manner in which he brought to an amicable conclusion the differences between the Native Chiefs and the British interests in the Gambia. The Morgania brought from the Gambia Dr Dochard and forty-six men belonging to the mission under Major Gray for exploring Africa. Dr D. had been at Sago ; but in consequence of internal wars he was unable to proceed further. Major Gray was there with very few men ; he will not proceed further for some time.  ID176,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1821,03,14,inform,Colonial Intelligence Sierra Leone Gazettes to the 16th of December have been received.

Providentially the first shock did not throw down many so that the inhabitants had time to escape before succeeding shocks otherwise theloss would have been dreadful. Only ten lives have been lost but not a house in the town has escaped without some injury. The town is still in a complete state of confusion ; one thousand give hundred houses more being so much injured as to be marked in order to be pulled down ; all the steeples in the place must be taken down. The streets are almost impassable from the fallen houses ; and great caution is required in walking to avoid the ruins that are still falling.  ID177,Glasgow Herald,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1821,03,30,inform,Emigration to Canada The following is an extract of a letter from a tradesman belonging to Glasgow who has been six years in Upper Canada to a friend in this city :– York Upper Canada 14th November 1820. You wish to be informed of the encouragement that you might meet with by an emigration to this country; and as you have determined to place the most implicit confidence in what I may advance. I shall therefore state to you the truth and nothing but tl[?] truth so help me God.– In the first place you wish to know what might be the value of a hundred acres of land with six or eight acres of improvement. This is a question that I cannot give a decided answer to as it depends entirely on the situation where you wish to purchase; but I may with safety average wild land in this Upper Province say at 4 to 6 dollars per acre and the clearing or improving of each acre will cost you from 16 to 20dollars.–In the next place you wish to know the price of cattle. They have never been known to be cheaper than at the present time. A cow can be purchased at 20 dollars a pair of working oxen at 40 dollars; a good cart horse at 50 dollars; sheep 2 dollars apiece. In regard to farming utensils there are but few used in this country at any time and a new settler may be some years in the woods before we want any more than an axe (3 dollars) a plough (10 dollars) and a harrow (5 dollars.)–You wish to know the nature of a Government grant; that has now become no object as the charges made by Government exceed in many cases what you can purchase land for; and by buying land you have the advantage of choosing a situation agreeable to your mind; but the reverse is the case when you accept of a grant from Government for you must then take your chance by drawing by lottery; and as the land is already taken up for forty miles round this place you will then be obliged to go back into the woods and out of the world. You are at liberty to sell it as soon as you receive the grant; formerly you could.–You wish to know what sum you could establish yourself for in this country as a farmer. There is one thing obvious–the more you bring the less miseries and difficulties you will have to undergo. But as a true friend I would advise you not to think of leaving home with a sum less than t200 sterling with a sum less than this you undoubtedly subject yourself to hardships and troubles that you have no idea of. Though many have settled here for nothing their fate has been such that it is beyond my pend to describe; and my greatest enemy I should not advise to come to this country with the intention of farming with less capital than I have no stated to you. Many may flatter you and stuff your head with golden dreams about this country; but you must allow the experience that I have had to outweigh the statements of many that you may have had an opportunity of talking with who may pretend to have some knowledge of this country for there are but few settlements between Montreal and the falls of Niagara (a distance of nearly 600 miles) that I have not visited.–As to the necessaries wanted for a family who may think of coming to this country I should entirely confine myself to wearing apparel as clothes are the highest article in this country; and should you think of farming I would advise you to bring but few fine clothes but principally coarse and stout. Heavy luggage of any kind becomes very expensive and cumbersome bringing you up the river so far as this and is often liable to be damaged in consequence of the repeated re-shipping. The rate of charge of the transportation of good from Montreal to Kingston (200 miles) is 2 dollars per cwt.; and from Kingston to York (200 miles) they charge 1 dollar for each barrel bulk; and from Montreal to York you may get a passage for 10 dollars for each grown person.–By the by you wish to know the population of this town: it is indeed small in comparison to some of your towns; but I might say that the inhabitants of York might amount to 3000 people. But there is no place that I have visited in my travels that is more thriving than this town; and as a proof I can safely say that it is now twice the size that it was when I came here (now three years) and still continuing to increase greatly in buildings; but all wood.–You wish to know the different branches of business carried on here. They are principally house carpenters; and various other mechanics are also employed here.–You wish to know if any of the emigrants have arrived in this place. There are but very few I understand come thus far the greater part of them having stopped at a settlement called Perth about miles below Kingston. –Since I have now given answers to all your different queries let me now give my candid opinion respecting this country. In the first instance a farmer may live by hard labour; that is he may acquire a livelihood; but cash[?] is a complete hidden treasure and is as forbidden fruit to the farmer of this country; and in some places you may live for years and not even behold a silver dollar through a glass darkly as all is done by barter in the country. The next evil is the mixture of society; a very few good intermixed with a multitude of a very different character; but in many places you will be divested of all society either of a good or bad quality; in either of which situations I am afraid you will find yourself uncomfortable in consequence of its being so much different to what you have been accustomed to; and the opportunity of spending the sabbath in a religious worship you will also find wanting. And above all evils the fever and ague that none escape is the ruin of many a family in this country. But should you think of coming to this country in order to avoid this disease I would advise you to come no farther up the country than Perth settlement where this loathsome sickness is seldom known. Now my friend by what I have stated here I neither mean to advise or dissuade you from coming to this country; but take it into serious consideration before you embark upon this important.  ID178,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1821,05,03,inform,Canada Provincial Parliament of Lower Canada Quebec Legislative Council–March 17. This day his Excellency the Governor in Chief made the following[?] speech to both Houses:– Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly When the Parliament met for the dispatch of public business[?] I did entertain a hope that the experience of the [?] few years would have led you to a mature and serious consideration[?] of the consequences that would inevitably follow[?] if the then state of things should not be remedied ; I[?] cannot therefore be surprised that I should now express[?] not only my disappointment but great concern that [?] same question of constitutional principle should have [?]ia disturbed the unanimity of your legislative proceedings[?]. Upon this occasion I think it a duty which I owe to [?] and to your country to call upon you to consider during[?] this summer the result of the discussions of the sessesion[?] in all its bearings. You will see the administration of the civil government[?] left without any pecuniary means but what I shall advance[?] upon my own personal responsibility ; you will [?] individuals suffering under severe and unmerited hardships[?] caused by the wast of that constitutional authority that[?] is necessary for the payment of the expences of the civil[?] government.

In the course of the Session of the Colonial Parliament which was prorogued on the 14th April no less than three Addresses were presented to Earl Dalhousie to be forwarded to the King ; one respecting the allowance of half-pay to the Militia ; another respecting the duties imposed in British ports on lumber from Canada ; and third related to the losses sustained by the people of Canada during the late war. His excellency the Governor had intimated that no objection would be made to the repeal of the grant of 2500l on account of the Civil List for the Colony provided the salaray of the Chief retired Justice the ReceiverGeneral and that of the Speaker of the House of Assembly should be continued in the whole amounting to 1800l. The grant has for some time been a prominent subject of complaint in the Colonial Parliament. The 37th Regiment for three years stationed in Lower Canada is about to leave the Colony for England. The Staff Corps was to proceed to the Ottawa to carry into effect the intended plan for removing the obstructions in that river. An article from Montreal dated May 5 states that a messenger was leaving that place to announce the union of the North and Hudson's Bay Companies at their respective establishments. The former of these companies was under control of Lord Selkirk and the schism that has so long reigned between them with its fatal consequences is well know to the Public. By Letters from Bombay we learn that 20 ships have been taken up by the vigilant Governor on board of which 5000 troops are embarked destined to the Persian Gulph to repair the disaster suffered by the surprise of the detachment left by Sir Wm. Kier under the direction of a young man. The gallant Gen. Lionel Smith has been selected for this important service ; and we have no doubt but that he will convince the Arabs of the impolicy of their treacherous proceedings and justify the high confidence which the Go vernment of Bombay have in his talents and valour.– His Excellency Mr. Elphinstone completely recovered is gone on a tour to Kutch to settle all disputes and to ascertain the true situation of the country.– How important it is for the Heads of the Presidencies thus to judge from actual observation instead of trusting to mere reports.

This colony in fact is the only country that an Englishman should come to he neither changes climate not habits for here every thing hat occurs to him is the same except burning wood for coals. The country on the sea coast is very woody but much easier cleared than America and about ten miles in the interior several miles of extent have no wood at all. The ships behaves beautifully sails well and is easy ; we have never close reefed and not above twice double reefed and not strained a rope yarn nor split a sail. Extract of a letter received by My Leyden R. N. Leith from his Son Mate of the ship Skelton dated Sullivan's Cove off Hobart Town 29th November 1820 :– I take this opportunity of sending you a few lines by the ship Guildford which is to sail tomorrow for Baravia and then homewards. We left the Table Bay on 18th October and arrived here on 28th November making a very good passage. Did not see any vessel on the passage–made the island of Amsterdam and St Paul's on 28 November–went ashore on the island of Amsterdam for two or three hours found it to be barren entirely–only inhabited by give or six people from the Isle of France for the purpose of sealing. When we came near the land fell in with various winds and calms–made the river on Sunday about twelve o'clock and brought up off Hobart at three P M on Monday. The country has a very fine prospect a great deal of wood but interspersed with fields all in green for it is the spring here now–the pease are in full bloom. This town is very irregu larly built just like a Norwegian village–a deal of wooden houses–the appearance of the country pleases the eye greatly of the passengers and the visit they had from the Deputy Governor was very favourable. Governor M'Quarrie is to be here from Sidney in the course of a fortnight or three weeks to survey the Government works. The passengers are in great suspense whether they will forward themselves to Sydney or wait until he comes. Butter sells at 4s a lb ; coarse ship biscuits 35s. a cwt ; a pair of ashets middle size 21s. and every thing in like proportion. Salted pork would have sold very well–could clear L130 a cwt. Beef is about 6d. a lb. If you buy any here and pay in produce you pay more than in hard cash. There are few bush rangers now they were mostly all shot in the woods. No encouragement here for pickpockets. Some of the richest and most powerful men here have once been sent out as convicts but from their good behaviour got their emancipation. The Midship Leith upon the pier is here ; he is master of a colonial brig trading between Sydney and here. Our passengers tell me they can chuse what land they like ; but not the quality ; they must apply the saw and the hatchet a great deal. A hatchet costs 7s. 6d. a lb. Very few people have female servants as they can't trust them ; as those who come out are convicts and get soon married so they have all men servants.  ID182,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1821,07,16,inform,American Papers. New York May 8.

The gigantic projects that occupy the attention of our countrymen are truly surprising. A plan is now forming for example to establish a settlement at the mouth of the river Columbia for the purpose of importing teas direct from the East Indies. It is then proposed to transport this article of merchandize up the Columbia until it reaches the rocky mountains and then to proceed by land to the navigable branch of the Missouri. This embraces a space of three hundred and forty miles in extent. Of this distance 200 miles are represented by travellers as constituting an excellent road ; the remaining one hundred and forty comprehend the mountain barrier which must be passed by the intrepidity and labour of man. The merchandize will then by the aid of the Missouri and its subsidiary streams supply the whole western continent with the refreshing beverage. This shows the varied changes of commerse ; the Atlantic States have heretofore been the medium of supplying our western States with the productions of China ; but if this plan should be carried into effect we may receive our supply from that country through the western States. May 16.

On the day before mentioned our Governor received intelligence that a black man belonging to Cape Coast where the people are under our protection had been cruelly murdered by a Chief of the Fantes[?] at a place about six miles from Cape Coast called Moree[?]. I was immediately ordered to assemble all the soldiers I could in five minutes and proceed to Moree to seize the murderer. I quickly set off with four officers and 85 soliders. A little before we entered the town of Moree where the savages between 2 and 3000 in number were assembled we saw the mangled remains of their unforunate victim. The town stands near the top of a hill on the summit of which is an old Dutch Fort. As soon as we entered the town a fire was opened upon us ; but as my orders were to seize the murderer if possible without bloodshed I did not for some time allow the men to return the fire. However perceiving they were resolved to oppose us I gave directions to my little party to give them a volley and then to charge. The negroes retired as we advanced and in less than an hour we gained the hill from which our opponents fled in every firection. We demanded the keys of the fort from the principal man belonging to Moree ; who not being engaged in the affair had remained and who immediately gave them up. In the fort which has a draw-bridge we were perfectly secure from the attack of the negroes. The body we defeated were Fantees who were assembled to assist the Ashantees in enforcing some very unjust demands made by them on the people of Cape Coast. As soon as the Ashantees who reside near Cape Coast learned that the Governor had sent an armed force against their friends their drum beat to arms and they hastened after us ; fortunately we had defeated our opponents before they arrived. However they rallied the Fantees and took a position about half a mile from the town with a determination to oppose our little party. The Governor apprised of our situation assembled all the forces he could muster and speedily about 500 of the Cape Coast people headed by our officers and carrying the British flag were seen approaching. The enemy immediatel retired and we were relieved from our disagreeable situation after having been from nine in the morning till four in the afternoon exposed to a burning sun without refreshment. The negroes had 47 killed and upwards of 100 wounded in this affair ; we had one soldier killed and four wounded. Since the affair we have not seen one of the Ashantees or the Fantees here ; and a total stoppage of trade has taken place. We have not learned how the King of Ashantee intends to act nor is it safe to venture out of our limits except in large parties. New South Shetland –The Lord Melville J. Clark master has arrived in the London Docks from the New South Shetland fishery which he left on the 31st of March having on board the following persons belogning to the crews of the undermentioned vessels which had been wrecked and whom he landed at Buenos Ayres on the 21st of April viz. From the Hannah Captain Johnson–J.

He sailed from the River Plate on the 28th of April and reached the Downs on the 31st ult. Capt. Clark left a small colony at Easter Harbour consisting of the following individuals:–R. Gibbs of London first officer of the Lord Melville ; G. Robertson of Hamburgh second officer of the Minerva a vessel reported lost but since arrived in the Brazils ; J. Jornan of Leith boatswain of the Lord Melville ; P. Howson of Carron carpenter ; J. Lockey of Essex ; J. Semple of Dundee ; J. Ash of Liverpool ; J. Wares a Portuguese ; William South of Aberden ; J.

Several buildings have been burnt at the parish of St. Stephen's on the British side of the river others were saved with a great difficulty. From Calais to Eastport about a fortnight since the vessel in which our informant took passage was entirely enveloped in smoke.– In various places the fires have been burning for six weeks ; there had been no rain for eight weeks to wet the ground.– Boston Paper. Extract of a letter to a Lady in the vicinity of Chelmsford dated New Essex Graham's Town on the frontiers of Africa June 21 1821:– I am seven hundred miles from the Cape of Good Hope and should not receive intelligence of an arrival there for at least three weeks ; but my correspondent at Cape Town will procure comfortable lodgings &c. until a ship sails for Algoa Bay which is distant from me one hundred and thirty miles.– Few ships from England proceed farther than the Cape. Good ploughmen are wanted and good footploughs with spare wrought-iron shares and coulters which are very expensive here ; iron-work nothing under 1s. per lb. Ransome's ploughs sell for 14l. each. Ploughmen will find plenty of employers at from 2l. to 8l. per month and their board. Meat sells at 2d. per lb ; wheat 12s. bushel ; and barley 6s. Other articles of housekeeping are about the same price as in England ; but on the other hand we are in one of the healthiest climates in the world and free from rent tithes and taxes of every description. Any one may live here as well with 500l. as in his native land with 5000l. The farming work is still[?] done with oxen which are very fine and bought at 3l. each ; cows are 30s. ; and sheep 6s. a-head (having tails that weight 8lb. a complete lump of fat) ; clothes linen and all English goods very dear.– Good mechanics of any description have very high wages. A cargo of Ladies would make a good speculation in proceeding to the New Settlement ; for all that came out with the settlers have got husbands. By letters received from the Cape of Good Hope we understand that the Royal African corps was disbanded there on the 26th of June last. By letters from Bombay dated the 24 of May we learn that the Governor the Honourable Mr. Elphinstone has returned to the Presidency after a five months' tour to the northward. He must minutely examined all the judicial and revenue systems–furnishing the Collectors and Agents of Government with particular instructions for their guidance. He also sent out strong detachments to reduce some predatory hordes who have long plundered the country and been a terror to the peaceable natives. Those plunderers are are called Bheels[?]. They live in the hills and woods and descend in bands to commit their depredations. By these letters we learn what is essential for young men going out to India to know that Writers and Cadets now undergo an examination as to their knowledge of the native languages ; and no youth has a chance of success who is ignorant of the Hindoustanee[?]. The highest respect is entertained for the able manner in which the disinterested Dr. Gilchrist prepares young men for the services. We rejoice to learn that the Cholera Morbus has abated its rigour in the Deccan. Batavia journals of the 28th April give an account of a terrible earthquake which took place on the 29th December last on the south coast of Celebes. It did immense damage especially at Budekomba[?] where the sea rose several times to a prodigious height and then falling in with the incredible rapidity alternately deluged and left the shore destroying all the plantations from Bontain to Boelekomba[?]. Many hundred have lost their lives. The fort of Boelekom-[?] ba was much damaged that of Bontain less so. On the 4th of January this year there was another shock of an earthquake but we do not learn that it did any damage. It is with much regret we lay before our readers the following details of a most calamitous fire which broke out at Halifax Nova Scotia on the 17th ult. : Halifax Sept. 17. The conflagration this morning was one of the most awful and destructive every witness in Halifax. It originated in Sackville-street in the Bakery occupied by Shay and Milany and before it was discovered had gained an alarming height. It was near two o'clock when the bells were rung. The troops seamean of his Majesty's ships and inhabitants soon assembled ; the engines were judiciously placed lines formed to different reservoirs of water and every exertion made to extinguish the fire but we regret to state that before any check could be given to it the whole block of buildings with the exception of a house situated at the corner of Sackville and Blowers'-streets occupied by Mr H. Croskill the houses occupied by Mrs. Neilson and Mr T. Muirhead on Barringtonstreet and a stable belonging to J. W. Johnston Esq. in Granville-street were consumed. For some time great apprehensions were entertaintained that the fire would extend to the houses on the opposite side of the streets but fortunately it did not. Of the property burnt only about t1500 were insured and the calamity has mostly fallen where it will long be severely felt–upon windows and orphan children– upon industrious tradesmen whose whole stock of worldly wealth was invested in the tenements they occupied. To the troops and the seamen of the ships of war the town is as usual greatly indebted for the exertions made by them. Twenty-one houses were consumed with other valuable property. America appears to be very unhealthy just now– The accounts from Long Island Baltimore Amelia Island and Norfolk are extremely calamitous. The whole of Amelia Island is a perfect hospital not one family being well and in many instances not one to assist another. So dreadful indeed is the disease that there is not one sentinel to do duty. A New York Paper of the 30th ult. says– We are sorry to perceive from the Franklin Gazette that the malignant fever continues to make serious ravages among our fellow citizens at Baltimore. Four full victims to it in the 24 hours ending on Sunday morning ; and six during the 24 hours ending Monday morning.  ID185,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1821,11,07,inform,Colonial Intelligence In our last paper we gave from the Jamaiza Gazettes an account of the dreadful drought which had prevailed in that island for more than twelve months and the consequences of which had been most calamitous. We are now however most happy in being able to state upon the authority of a Gentleman who left Jamaica some days subsequently to the date of our preceding advices that this terible evil in such a climate particularly had at length ceased. The following is the substance of the information which has been communicated to us:– A few hours previous to my going on board the Jamaica packet on the 3d of September the rain fell in such torrents as to flood the streets of Kingston to the depth of two feet and it seemed to be general throughout the district of Liguanea. Though too late to save the crop of sugar for the present or perhaps the ensuing year this seasonable change of weather would at least have the effect of staying the mortality among the cattle. As such those interested in the island will receive the intelligence with gratification. On some properties the canes had been cut as fodder to save the stock. We have the Cape of Good Hope papers to the 6th August and as they are unusually barren in their contents it is fair to infer that every thing was proceeding there in a satisfactory manner. The only article of the slightest interest relates to the change the Governor is gradually effecting in the currency by removing from it all the base metal and substituting gold and silver of standard value. The Gazette of Dordrecht publishes accounts from Java to the 29th May. They confirm the statement of the decrease of the malady and mention that it was almost wholly subdued in the district of Samarang but that 18000 persons mostly Europeans had fallen victims. Batavia and Sourabaya were still infected. India –Extract of a letter from Calcutta dated June 20:– If the extension of foreign trading be considered with you as a means suited to alleviate the pressure and ease the difficulties of Old England which we read of here we imagine that India can furnish beneficial openings to this kind of remedy. The use of articles of British production and exports is gaining ground rapidly here ; the English printed cottons are now carried in considerable quantities as far as Rajpootha and find a ready sale if they be of handsome patterns. The warehouses now are so far from being overstocked that before the arrival of two vessels from England in the last fortnight all European articles were exorbitantly high ; mustard flour sold about 20s. a pound ; cheese 1[?] ; ham three half crowns the ld ; a common round hat three guineas. These undoubtedly were prices arising from an unusual scarcity ; but it surely cannot be so very bad a trading which admits even indicidentally of such an exaggeration of price and profit. Government bonds are now at six per cent premium though they bear but half the usual or legal interest of the country. This is a tolerable evidence of the credit of the Company and the Government. There is a great and increasing prosperity in Hindostan. The augmented cultivation of the Upper Provinces within these two years is surprising.  ID189,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1822,10,19,inform,On Monday 14th instant the ship Andromeda of London James Muddle master sailed from Leith Roads for New South Wales with 67 passengers all of whom are very respectable people.

With an Appendix &c. T his Report only reached us yesterday ; but the Society brings so much benevolence into activity under the guidance of practical wisdom aided by very enlightened views of the best interests of society that we consider any delay improper in calling the attention of the public to their valuable proceedings. The present Report abounds with evidence that they have not relaxed in their exertions. At home not only are the laws improving but the magistracy are carrying improvements into all the practical departments. A great many jails designed on much better principlpes are in progress in different parts of the country ; and in those which are used it may be said generally that much more attentions is paid to health cleanliness diet employment and classification. It must not be thought however that nothing remains to be done. There are still jails in which prisoners are double ironed and chained to the floor of their cels from night to morning ; others in which persons committed for trial are fettered with irons of the weight of from seven to nine pounds ; and others in which debtors are exposed to the contaminating society of criminals in which neither the various classes of prisoners nor the two sexes are kept separate from each other and in which all are allowed to be idle. The Magistrates of Surrey have provided a covered vehicle for conveying prisoners to the Sessions'house ; but in the metropolis it would appear the practise still continues of inflicting public degradation on parties arraigned or merely suspected of crime by marching them handcuffed through the streets of London ; and very recently a party of one hun- dred prisoners were marched for a mile handcuffed through the open streets in order to be formally set at liber- ty by proclamation ! So much for metropolitan decorum ! These shameful exhibitions and practises cannot however long maintain their ground ; the publicity given to them through the proceedings of the Society should of itself be enough to do them away ; but while they are continued England should be somewhat chary of her boasts. The views and principles of the Prison Society are attracting notice and gaining ground in France Switzerland the Netherlands Hanover Bavaria Wurtemberg Denmark Norway Sweden and Russia. At Christiana the Magistrates have already resolved on the erection of a new city gaol. In St Petersburgh the prisoners are now furnished with food clothing baths and medical assistance. A Ladies' Association under the patronage of the Princess Mesthersky is also in full activity at St Petersburgh ; and there is an auxiliary prison society at Orel on the very frontiers of Siberia. Seven thousand prisoners passed through Orel last year ; but their chains have been lightened and their condition meliorated generally through the exertions of the Russian Society. For details however we must refer to the Report itself ; but we cannot take leave of it without making special notice of the benefits conferred on society by the Female Associations and Temporary Refuge. The almost miraculous power of kindness when accompanied as genuine kindness often is with quiet feeling and unobtrusive goodness continues to be exemplified in the Ladies' Committee of which Mrs Fry we believe is still at the head. In Newgate idleness dissipation and licentiousness have been succeeded by industry order and restraint ; and the same committee accomplish much good by visiting the ships in which convicts are embarked for New South Wales. Arrangements are thus made for the formation of schools for moral and religious instruction during the voyage and the convicts are furnished not only with suitable clothing and other necessaries but the means of employment in the manufacture of such articles as may be readily sold for their relief on arriving at the colony. These are truly good works ; and too much praise cannot be bestowed on the Ladies by whom they are performed. It is gratifying to observe that Female Associations for visiting prisons have been established in Bedford Bristol Carlisle Colchester Derby Dumfries Durham Exeter Lancaster Nottingham Plymouth York and Glasgow. We had once thought that by this time we might have added Edinburgh ; and we are inclined to hope that the present Lord Provost will yet employ his influence in establishing a Lady's Society for the prisons of our Metropolis.– There too we had cherished and still cherish the hope of seeing a House of Refuge. The temporary refuge of the Prison Society is chiefly for affording relief to distressed boys who on their discharge from the prisons of the metropolis have expressed a desire to abandon their criminal courses. Many of these are in circumstances of urgent want ; and the Committee can now look round wtih pleasure on many who are variously settled and conducting them- selves exemplarily. In the temporary refuge they are trained up to habits of industry instructed in moral and religious duty and after a time are provided with suitable situations. There is a great similarity in the histories of the individuals admitted into this asylum ; but the greater number obviously consists of boys who had been almost driven to commit petty thefts from want of employment or destitution or who from neglect or loss of parents had fallen into the company of professed thieves. The Committee mention that on one recent occasion no less than eight boys were released from Newgate in one day and immediately after they had undergone the sentence of flogging which upon some insane rule is usually carried into effect on the day of their discharge. Their persons are thus marked with the stigma of guilt and from soreness and want of strength they are disabled from working at the very time they ought to go in search of employment. No more effectual plan could have been devised to irritate these boys against society to prevent them from obtaining employment though desirous of it or to impel them to recommence their career of crime. We entreat those who are inclined to look upon what they call a smart whipping as the only corrective for juvenile offences to reflect a little on the consequences to which their system inevitably tends. We are decidedly and in all cases against the deliberate infliction of pain merely to be felt as such. In the case of children if not necessary for that purpose it will certainly give them the idea of power superior to their own and may thus be the means of constraining more readily than otherwise ; but the law when it inflicts pain has always other means of evincing its power and constraining those who are within its grasp. Its most important function is to prevent crime ; its next is o convince those who comit offences that the means of detection are on the whole so sure that nothing is to be gained by the commission ; and its next to make restitution onerous and complete. There may also be some classes of criminals who ought to be considered and treated as mad –some are curable ; and some as incurably furious who must either be cut off altogether or confined for life. We are not opposed to the infliction of punishments because in our opinion the most effectual of those will be found to consist in the best means of preventing or remedying the evils produced by crime. All exposures restraints constraints and compulsory reparations are punishments. We are only hostile to the infliction of pain for no other purpose but because pain is produced. If it can be made obvious to the sufferers that the pain inflicted protects others or affords true reparation for the wrongs done to them or society we shall then grant that such punishments may be both just and expedient. The Prison Society while they vindicate themselves temperately but firmly from the charge of having yielded to a sort of blind and irrational benevolence and advocated measures which went to raise the condition of prisoners above that of common labourers do still seem to us to have been too much moved by the coarse jokes and reckless speculations of a clever essayist. If they err at all they seem now to be somewhat too indulgent to the advocates of hard labour and severe punishments. We are rather inclined to think them too decidely in favour of the tread mill which they allow has been so worked or constructed at different places as to form very unequal measures of punishment and they very properly insist that every tread-mill should be provided with a regulator by which its rate of revolution may at all times be restrained within safe limits and a dial-register (lately invented by Mr Bate instrumentmaker to the Board of Excise) by which the rate of labour may be at any time accurately ascertained and which ( they think ) should in no case exceed 12000 feet in ascent for one day. There is an able argument in the report against compelling persons to labour who are merely imrpisoned for trial : and there is a great mass of curious and useful information in the Appendix.  ID197,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1824,03,06,inform,Total Charge t7856 0 11 In January 1823 there were 3031 in the hulks ; 2138 have been received since ; 1402 have been sent to New South Wales ; and 300 to Bermuda ; 468 have been discharge by pardon or transferred to other establishments ; 3 have escaped ; 43 have died ; and 2953 remained in the different hulks on 1st Janury last. The health of these prisoners has been good their conduct orderly. The Office-bearers of the Refuge for the Destitute have during the last year given relief to 424 persons. They have apprenticed to trades recommended to service or employment or restored to parents and friends 214 individuals :–under their charge at present 154. Most of the male culprits require to be kept two years at least. The expenditure has been very considerable. Mr Peel has recommended a grant from Parliament. As we feared the bill introduced for the purpose of qualifying persons possessed of personal property to serve as juries contains no regulations for the more impartial striking of juries or returning or making up of those who are to serve on each jury. There does seem to be an improvement on the form of the returns to be made by the Constables to the Sheriffs.  ID198,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1824,04,03,inform,Scottish Intelligence. Repeated instances have lately occurred in whcih dwellinghouses have suffered damage by fire owing to the carelessnes of servants and others who by way of economy take off fires at night and put the burning coals under the grate not recollecting that in the construction of almost every house the stone placed under the grate is supported by timber separated from the hearth stone by some lime only. The wood underneath being once ignited the fire will rapidly spread and may in a few hours involve the whole tenement in flames. Emigration to Australia. –We understand that the establishment of an Australian Company has suggested to a number of public spirited individuals the idea of forming a society to aid deserving persons in their endeavours to emigrate and settle in New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land and that matters are actually in progress for carrying this benevolent project into effect. On Wednesday a meeting was held in the Freemasons' Hall Niddry Street which was respectably attended the Rev. Mr Lothian in the Chair when a series of resolutions were moved by William Ellis Esq. S. S. C. and seocnd by Robert Paul Esq. of the Commercial Bank. The principal object comprehended in those were the security of the persons and property of emigrants on the voyage–the maintenance of a regular communication with friends left behind and the insuring a friendly welcome temporary accommodation and facilities for permanent settlement in the country of their adoption. It was also proposed to give assistance in money to deserving emigrants for the purpose of defraying the expenses of freight and passage out–every applicant being first well recommended and his character subjected to strict scrutiny. Masons wrights smiths and other artisans schoolmasters farm servants and labourers are the classes to which the principles of the society specially apply. According to the opinion of persons largely engaged in the silktrade the amount of drawback to be allowed on silk that has paid the duty will be between t300000 and t400000. On Sunday evening a disturbance took place in a house in Tobago Street and the Police were called who to make sure of the rioter secured the door ; at which a young woman a servant became so much alarmed that she leaped out of a window situated on the third floor whereby her back was broken. She now lies very ill in the Royal Infirmary. The Army –The several Recruiting Parties throughout Great Britain and Ireland having received their instructions are now actively employed in raising men for the three new Regiments of the Line whose establishments it is expected will be in a very short time completed. The Head-quarters of the 97th Regiment are changedfrom Gosport to Winchester.  ID200,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1824,06,09,inform,Mr Secretary Peel in moving the commitment of the Transportation Bill stated that the objects of the bill were first to continue the laws on transportation that would expire before the next session ; and next to cimplify the law. In the last session a bill had been passed to enable the Crown to make an experiment of the union of the hulk and transportation system by sending convicts to Bermuda. There had been as yet hardly time to decide fully on the experiment but as far as it could be judged of it was satisfactory. It had been hithero complained that transportation was a very esqual punishment and certainly there was a great different in the effect of the punishment upon a man of settled habits and with a family and upon a man of no fixed habits to whom as hitherto managed it had scarcely been a punishment. He wished it to be known that arrangements had been made in New South Wales to send some of the convicts to a distant part of the settlement where the punishment would be more severe. A selection would be made from the convicts so as to make the punishment efficient against those to whom it had hitherto had no terror.– He gave this statement because it was right the public should know that transportation would be henceforward a real punishment.  ID201,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1824,08,25,inform,Press at Cape of Good Hope Mr Greig after stating the correspondence which took place between him and the Fiscal which led to the suppression of his journal gives the following account of his interview with that functionary. On Monday evening the Fiscal sent a messenger to me requesting I would call at his house in Strand-street; I did so ; he then opened a conversation upon the subject of my paper The South African Commercial Advertiser and said he was instructed to inform me that I had departed from the Prospectus – that it was become obnoxious to the Government and referred more particularly to the last three or four Numbers. I asked him to point out such parts as were immediately objectionable. He then mentioned some leading remarks which (he said) bore upon the Administration of the Colony. He further pointed out as ob- noxious all quotations which had been made from De Lolne[?] Blackstone and Civil Servant'swork Lacon and generally all extracts relative to the Liberty of the Press observing – Nobody can doubt the obvious tendency of these ; and as we are not men in this Colony but merely infants it was in his opinion dangerous to insert such matter. He added also that it was expected I should in future publish no parts of trials but wait until the whole were finished ; and even then all scurrilous parts (such as the Memorial of Mr L. Cooke to the Treasury) were to be omitted. That I was further to bound down with two sureties in the penalty of ten thousand rix-dollars that nothing of the offensive nature pointed out should appear in any future number ; and lastly that I was to take particular care that the next number (18) contained no matter of the description alluded to nor any notice of Mr Edward's trial. To all this I replied that I would give no promise as to what would appear in the next or any future number. That I required time to consider what was fitting to be done with regard to the security demanded. The Morning Chronicle makes the following remarks on this case :– We cannot say that we are surprised that acts of this description should take place in our Colonies. Uncontrouled power produces every day in Europe the worst effects on men of the best dispositions and the best talents and the Governors of our conquered Colonies and New South Wales are unfortunately quite absolute. In Europe the people under absolute Governments have this advantage over the people in our colonies that men in office are generally selected with some reference to abilities and acquirements. But with the exception of the East Indies the Gonernment of which with all its faults generally we believe avails itself of talents our colonies are unfortunately considered as mere places of refuge for the relatives of our Aristocracy of whom nothing can be made in this country. This is what constitutes fitness for a Colonial Office ; and so far from being astonished at the disgraceful scenes which are constantly taking place in the colonies every person capable of reflecting at all upon the matter would be astonished were he to find common abilities the holder of a colonial appointment of any value. Of Lord Charles Somerset the less that is said the better. In fact nothing is more wanted than the perusal of a Cape of Good Hope Almanack to satisfy the British public what sort of personage he is. Would it be believe that in a country of boundless extent with only a settlement here and there where the greatest enemies the Colonists have to contend with are the wild animals it could possible enter in to the head of any rarional being to introduce laws for the preservation of game. One would as soon expect to hear laws in Turkey for the preservation of the plague. Yet it so happens that a code which would do credit to Sir John Shelley himself guarding against the possible disinction of the game of Africa occupies a goodly space in the Cape Almanack. After such a specimen of wisdom all criticism on this personage would be thrown away.  ID202,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1824,02,11,inform,London.

Mackintosh presented a petition from Mr Charles Buck complaining that managers of theatres were allowed to perform dramatic pieces without the knowledge or leave of the writer and without any profit to him. The hon. member said that Lord Byron and Mr Millman had made similar complaints and that every person who had given that subject consideration admitted that literary property was not sufficiently protected in this country and that the decline of dramatic writing was to be attributed to the state of the law. Mr G. Lamb thought it a very serious grievance that if a man wrote a tragedy it might be taken by any manager and performed on the stage and the writer brought to the miserable condition of a damned author nolens volenns. ( A laugh. ) The decline of dramatic writing in this country was to be ascribed to the unprofitable nature of that description of writing as compared with other branches of literature ; and it would be very desirable if a dramatic author had power to sell his play like any other description of property and that no manager should perform it without paying the writer which was the system in France. The petition was ordered to be printed. Birmingham Petition. Mr Brougham rose to present a petition from a very respectable body. It had been agreed to at a numerous meeting of manufacturers artisans and other inhabitants of Birmingham and was signed by 8000 persons without solicitation. they contended that the distress which now prevailed not only had reference to that poorer classes of society but spread itself over the whole system of society. This distress the petitioners ascribed to the tampering that had taken place with the currency. Their opinion was that too much stress was laid upon the panic which had taken place in 1825 ; for though it was true that a great number of failures had taken place among the bankers yet it was no less true that of about 70 bankers who had failed as many as 80[?] had subsequently paid 20s in the pound. If such were the case he was very glad to hear it. The opinion of the petitioners rather was that the present distress arose from the speculations and over-trading which had taken place ; and that such might have been the case topitally[?] there could be no manner of doubt That a great deal of the distress of the nation had arisen from the depreciation of the currency by which people were now paying taxes at a rate that had never been intended when they were originally imposed was extremely likely ; but whether it operated to the extent that the petitioners described was another question. In the year 1819 he had been one of those who had resisted the imposition of new taxes because he thought that that was the very worst time that Ministers could have chosen for such an object. His opinion however had been over-ruled and the taxes had been increased. That the effect of this must be to cripple the industry of the country no man could doubt ; and what he wished was to see a remedy for t ; but the misfortune was that after making every possible retrenchment–by reducing salaries and dealing in the best possible way with all the payments which the nation had to make–the Dead Weight would still remain round the neck of the country and press it down to the effectual injury of its best interests. How were they to get over the 800 millions of debt and the 30 or 40 millions of interest annually payable thereon? In the latter part of the petition he entirely agreed and hoped that every thing would be done to give the people as great relief from the pressure of the taxes as might be consistent with a due regard to the public credit and the service of the State ; and so far from treating this remedy lightly the more he thought that the petitioners were wrong in their observations on the tampering of the currency the more he was inclined to listen to that part of the petition which appeared to him to be founded on truth. Mr Bennett was of opinion that the forced restoration of a metallic currency was one of the principal causes of the present distress. The taxes were now paid in money and it now required twice the produce to pay them which it did before the year 1819. That was nothing less than a robbery but how it was to be remedied he really was at a loss to know. He would never break faith with the public creditor and the only means to pay off our public debt would be to impose an income tax. If the public debt were once removed then free trade could take place in every branch of trade but not till then. Such was the opinion of his late friend Mr Ricardo and sooner or later he thought some such measure would be resorted to. Mr Alderman Waitham observed that it was strange that while the public distress was admitted to be extreme no effort was made to reduce the public expenditure. He was ready to prove that the export trade of the country had fallen off to the amount of from nearly nine to thirteen millions although he knew that in saying this he was encountering serious adversaries. He did not under-rate our export trade ; it was valuable but for a period of thirty-one years it had fallen off at the rate of six millions per annum ; and this could be shewn from Parliamentary documents. With respect to the petition now before the house he mainly agreed with its statements while at the same time he could never consent to any thing like a breach of faith with the public creditor. Mr W. Whitmore heard with astonishment that our foreign trade had greatly diminished the reverse being so notoriously the fact. Since 1814 there was certainly a fall in the value of our manufactures but so there was in the raw material and the vast increase of machinery should also be taken into account. It was said that our exports had declined but facts would prove decidedly the reverse. From 1790 to 1799 the exports were L17000000 ; from 1800 to 1809 L26000000; from 1810 to 1819 L36000000 ; from 1821 to 1826 L45000000 ; in 1827 L51000000 ; and in 1828 the amounts of exports rose to L52000000– So much for the alleged decrease of our export trade as stated by the worthy Alderman ( hear hear hear. ) In 1819[?] the currency was in the greatest state of depreciation ; but he begged pardon for having said so much and he was induced to offer a word in order to counteract the danger which might arise if the statements of the worthy Alderman remained unanswered. Mr Sec. Peel observed that whenever any change however calculated to be ultimately beneficial was made in the system of our currency it must be attended in the first instance with considerable inconveniences. The more he considered the subject the more was he convinced that the best interests of the nation required that we should strictly adhere to the law of our currency now established. ( Hear hear. ) He hoped he should never see the time when the restrictions on cash payments should be renewed. When however the petitioners declared it to be expedient to increase the amount of our currency by an issue of paper he would ask them what they would in that case do with the Exchanges? If the Exchanges fell the gold would go out of the country. What would they do? They must renew the restriction on cash payments by the Bank. It was not any change in the value of the currency but the prosperity of Manchester that had occasioned the depression in Spitalfields. In 1820 the number of factories in Manchester were fifty-four and they were assessed at the annual value of L16816 ; in 1823 they were 56 assessed at L18293 ; in 1826 when the small notes bill passed the numbers were 72 assessed at L24034 ; in 1828 the year before the small notes bill took effect the numbers were 73 and they were assessed at L25245. The hon. gentleman opposite had said that no fresh capital had been employed in this trade but that persons would work at a loss rather than let their machines stand idle. But if this were the case it would not account for the erection of 12 new factories the establishment of which was irreconcileable with the idea of general stagnation. With respect to the silk trade in Manchester in 1823 there were 2500 looms and in 1828 there were 8000 ; and there were between 3 and 4000 looms working manufactured articles of silk mixed with cotton. He had had a letter from Manchester dated 1st of June upon which he could rely and it stated that all the silk weavers were or might be in active emply. For the last ten years at Manchester machinery had improved in powers of production in the ratio of 10 per cent per annum. Few persons had attributed enough to the importation of labourers from Ireland. A greater number of Irish labourers in the manufacturing districts were out of emply than people could imagine and the Magistrates relieved them rather than pass them to their parishes reflecting that as they had contributed to the prosperity ot the places they had a right to relief when in distress. Where the passage was so low and this country possessed the advantage of a legal provision for the poor it was impossible to check the influx of Irish labourers and this fact would suggest important alterations in the state of the law. ( Hear hear. ) He felt convinced that any alterations with respect to the values of the currency would be attended with the greatest evils to every class. Mr W. Horton observed that some honourable gentleman considered the distress of our artisans and manufacturers to arise from the state of the currency ; but he (Mr Horton) was at a loss to see how the redundant labour at Shipley could have been affected by the change of the currency. Another class were the antipodes of these–they imputed our distress to the corn laws. But it was idle to talk of altering the corn laws; we should look to practical remedies. As long as a redundancy of labour existed in England which was aggravated by the condition of the Irish who flocked to England and operated a still further prejudice to the labouring class of this country the distress would continue. The remedy which he proposed for the evil he had pointed out was emigration in the manner proposed in the report of a committee of which he had the honour to be the chairman by parishes advancing a sum of money to locate pauper labourers in our North American colonies. The right hon. gentleman then read opinions in approbation of his plan from Mr Tooke Mr Malthus Colonel Torrens and others and observed that he had the opinion of the late Mr Ricardo to the same effect in a lette which had been published. He then entered into a calculation to show the saving to parishes by this plan and he challenged any member of the house the show the fallacy of the calculations.– There was however an answer so easy that it was constantly made– The vacuum would be filled up immediately. This was a delicate subject to touch upon for he knew not how the vacuum could be filled up but by the introduction of young gentlemen and ladies. ( A laugh.) But was it supposed that fifty labourers would be replaced immediately by fifty children? Or did these objectors suppose that labourers would be brought from Russia or elsewhere ? The right honourable gentleman then adverted to the remarks in Mr Sadler's work wherein it was stated that is appeared from the official documents that the mor tality amongst the emigrants to North America had been in the unprecedented proportion of 4 in 14 whereas in Wales the proportion was 1 in 69 and in England 1 in 57. This he would assert was an incorrect statement. So far from the proportion being 1 in 14 it was only 1 in 40 the same proportion which existed in Carlisle the healthiest place in England. The emigrants it should be recollected carried out children and the mortality amongst children was in the proportion of 1 in 12 and in London much greater ; for it had been ascertained that out of 1000 infants amongst the poor only 542 survived the period of nursing. The right hon. gentleman concluded with reading his last resolution– That it is expedient that such measures should be adopted in the next Session of Parliament as may furnish the most safe and effectual means of producing the desird improvement by a judicious application of both these principles and at the same time under conditions which will prevent the probability of a recurrence of similar evils and also effect a material saving of the national income instead of producing an increased charge thereon. Mr Huskisson contended that colonization ought to be encouraged. Had it not been for emigration this country could never have reached its present state of importance and prosperity nor would our language have been extended to the United States and been adopted in more distant countries. If there were one circumstance more striking than another it was the prodigious increase of consumption a proof of the growing wealth and resources of the country. In the year 1814 the exchange in trade was against us ; now it was in our favour. This country would carry on its great affairs with as small a portion of metallic currency as possible but let them guard against a system which had led to depreciation of the currency and the panic which was felt in 1825. He had heard somewhere a metaphor respecting paper currency. Like a skyrocket it rose with splendour but lost its brightness and when its fire was extinguished it fell in darkness like the shaft of the rocket upon the heads of those who had raised it. Mr Secretary Peel said in consequence of the course of policy which he had deemed it advisable to adopt in the previous Session a series of unfounded calumnies had been levelled at him which however he had despised too much to condescend to notice. But there was one which as it reflected on his public and official character he would with permission of the house allude to on that occasion. The report to which he alluded was that he had used his influence as Secretary of State to procure an enormous grant of land for a relative of his. ( Hear hear hear. ) In consequence of seeing this report in the public newspapers he had requested his right honourable friend to move in that house for the production of certain papers calculted to explain the whole matter. Those papers had in consequence been produced and were now printed ; he trusted however that the house would excuse him for again alluding to the subject. ( Hear hear hear. ) He hoped that the consequence of those papers being printed would have been that some member would have asked some questions on the subject ; but though this was not the case he had received a communication which made him think that some one out of doors had been imposed upon by the calumny though no member of that house had been so deceived ( cheering.) He begged in the first place to state most distinctly that he had procured no grant of land for any brother of his ( hear ) A gentleman whose name was the same as his and who was his second cousin had had a grant made him by his right hon. friend ; but in that grant he begged to state to the house upon his word of honour as a gentleman he had had no participation whatever ( hear.) With respect to the settlement on the Swan River he was ashamed to say that he had neither heard nor knew of it till he received a letter from his cousin announcing to him that he had abandoned the idea of going to New South Wales ; and that from the circumstances of Mr Twiss informing him that government would be disposed to afford assistance to any settlers going to the Swan River he and three other gentlemen had been induced to send in a proposal to that effect. With respect to the other calumnies which had been promulgated against him they rather went to private matters and he had therefore not condescended to notice them ; but as this one had reference to the public department in which he officiated he had thought it so far a public concern as to venture to ask the attention of the house while he trespassed on it to disclaim any participation in the grant that had been made ( hear.. Sir Geo. Murray –The house would probably think after the statement of his right honourable friend that it would be unnecessary for him to rise to address them ( hear.) He was satisfied that the house knew that his right hon. friend was incapable of proposing anything that would come under the designation of what was vulgarly called a job ( hear.) Adjournment. Mr Secretary Peel gave notice that he should tomorrow move the adjournment of the house to that day week. The right hon. gentleman at the same time presented a petition from the Apothecaries Company of London in favour as we understood of the bill regarding dissection. Mr Wilmot Horton rose to propose the resolutions of wich he had given notic relative to the state of the labouring poor. The firt resolution having been put from the chair The Chancellor of the Exchequer moved as an amendment that the order of the day be now read. Mr Bennett opposed the resolutions. The amendement was agreed to without a division. Mr Labouchere postponed until to-morrow his motion respecting Canada. Slave Trade. Mr Otway Cave moved the following resolutions: Resolved 1st. That no human legislature has any lawful power to abridge or destroy the natural rights of life and liberty unless the owner shall himself commit some criminal act that amounts to a forfeiture. 2d That although neither the government nor the legislature of the county have arrogated to themselves the power of destroying the natural rights of innocent British subjects or of delegating any such power to other authorities it is a notorious fact that in many British Colonies lying remote from the immediate observation of the Government innocent British born subjects are from the time of their birth robbed of their natural rights and converted into slaves. 3. That it is the especial duty of this House as the Representatives of the people to take effectual measures for protecting all British subjects that shall be born henceforward in the West Indian Colonies from similar violations of their natural inherent and paramount rights as human beings. The motion being seconded by Mr Lumley Mr W. Smith said he could not give his support to these resolutions because they were connected with a question of too much importance to be agitated in such a manner and at such a period of the Session. Mr Huskisson was of opinion that resolutions of such a description as those brought forward by the hon. member ought to be met by a direct negative. Strangers were then ordered to withdraw. The resolutions were declared to be negatived without a division. The other orders of the day were then disposed of and the house adjourned at half-past one o'clock.  ID214,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1829,08,19,inform,London Saturday August 15 1829 The King. –We are happy to learn from a private source of unquestionable authenticity that the King has seldom if ever in his whole life enjoyed better health than at the present moment.

General Sir W. Gordon QuarterMaster General ; Sir George Murray Sir Charles Dance and a large number of military and scientific gentlemen. His Grace Sir W. Gordon the Ladies Percy &c. had a carriage attacked and rode round the yard with the greatest pleasure and satisfaction. Afterwards a waggon was fastened to the steam carriage containing 27 soldiers besides Mr Gurney and two or three men on the engine and though the road was very disadvantageous being a rough loose sand and gravel it drew them round without the least diminuition of its speed between nine and ten miles an hour. In these experiments Mr Gurney applied his steam generally but to one wheel in order to give the company full proof of the power and practicability of the invention. Having satisfied them as to this and as to its manageability by a variety of involutions and evolutions he gave them a specimen of its speed and drove seven or eight times round at the rate of 16 or 17 miles an hour. It is difficult to say whether the company was more pleased or surprised at these unequivocal proofs of Mr Gurney's success. The Duke of Wellington observed that it was scarcely possible to calculate the benefits we should derive from the introduction of such an invention as this. The French papers of Tuesday state that the Emperor Nicholas was preparing to make a new levy at the rate of 4 upon every 500 male individuals which would give about 160000 fresh soldiers.

On the other hand we are told that the Sultan has rejected those terms and that notwithstanding the successes gained by the Russians he was resolved to run all the chances of a desperate struggle rather than submit to conditions which he deemed insulting. The English Bench. –There are two vacancies at present on the judicial Bench ;–one occasioned by the death of Mr Baron Hullock ; the other by the more recent decease of Mr Charles Warren Chief Justice of Chester who expired at his house in Bedford Square on Wednesday afternoon in the 66th year of his age.

With respect to the Chief Justiceship of Chester an evening paer the Sun very properly recalls to public recollection the fact that the Commissioners on the Common Law had recommended in their report the abolition of the Welsh judgeships altogether; and adds an opinion in which we perfectly coincide tht the present seems a fair opportunity for carrying the recommendation into effect. Indeed in our mind every opportunity is a fair one for reducing public expences when public burdens are oppressive. Platina Coin. –We have seen a specimen of the new Russian platina coinage. The coin is about the size of a shilling but heavier than a sovereign and of three roubles value. On one side are the Russian eagle and imperial arms; on the other the value of the coin and date– Globe. Ugly Wives Fittest for Poets. –The spouses of the living British poets are well known to be among the plainest of the sect as Mr Slinslop would say.–is wedded to the head of a gorgon – – is not much better off – – has eloped from his mate. We might run through the whole catalogue without discovering a handsome woman yet none have exceleed these writers in descriptions of female beauty. The truth is that the contemplation of a bottle or peaked nose a wide mouth goggle eyes and a spare body causes an author to set out with more enthusiasm in search of the ideal of womanly perfections and affords the widest scope to the imagination. Nothing impedes the fancy more domestic intercourse with a celestial shape and divine face ; in which case a fatal uxoriousness supersedes the poet's diligence and he ceases impotently to describe what he can well enjoy. Milton's Eve was not copied from Mrs Milton grilling his dinner at the kitchen fire–but from some unattainable damsel of his fancy. Plurality of women is only allowed to a poet– one lawful plain household wife–and as many airy mistresses as he can embody.  ID215,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1829,11,04,inform,Swan River. –The ship Warrior Stone commander bound to Swan River Sydney and the East Indies sailed for her destination on Friday from Portsmouth with prospects of favourable weather in her progress down the Channel. The Warrior is a fine vessel of about 700 tons burden and carried out upwards of 250 passengers to the new settlement. Several of the passengers are persons of independent fortune who have embarked considerable property in the speculation ; and and two ofthem named Byrne and Molloy paid the enormous sum of L1000 for the best accommodation the vessel could afford their families and suite. Six pianos are on board the Warrior and a proportionate number of fair and accomplished vocalists and musicians of course accompany the instruments to their destination. The Warrior has also on board fifty dogs of the choicest breed several pens of sheep considerable number of swine two milch cows and three valuable horses ; but as tempestuous weather may be anticipated on the vessel reaching the Bay of Biscay apprehensions are entertained that a portion of the live cargo must be consigned to the ocean before the termination of the voyage. It is calculated that from the advantageous arrangements entered into by the commander and a gentleman named Semple who has chartered the Warrior and gone out in her they will clear the enormous sum of L10000 by the voyage.  ID217,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1830,10,09,inform,Swan River Settlement. –On the 13th inst. the Swedish ship Sterling Captain D.

This is a sly censure upon the habit of our countrymen one-fifth or sixth part of whom we were supposed by implication to be cut off permanently by intemperance! We admit that a few hearty fellows do go off in apoplexy; but we deny that the number bears any proportion to the amount supposed; we have two other remarks to make on his statement. First since our manners were corrupted by imitating English fashions it is whispered we hope un that there are such things as tippling women in country some of whom do disappear suddenly–no matter how; and secondly we wish our London friend inform us how it happens that while all Broad England has only an excess of 11 1/2 per cent females Edinburgh should have no less than 24! We understand that since this astounding fact was brought out there has been a great efflux of ladies from the city to the adjoining counties. We know a number who have or are flying to Fife and the north. A friend who careful observer compares it to the dispersion of the Jews. The ladies he says attribute their flight to Cholera Maribus!  ID222,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1831,12,17,inform,The Ann Jameson Alexander sailed from Leith Roads on Tuesday morning for Bombay Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales with a full cargo between twenty and thirty passengers consisting mostly of young ladies.  ID225,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1832,04,07,inform,Mr Hume differed from the view taken of the subject by the right hon. baronet. He was of opinion that it was the duty of Government to give commutation allowance to pensioners anxious to emigrate either to New South Wales or to Canada. He could not forebear complaining of the large increase of pensions which had taken place since the year 1814. It was impossible to doubt that much misconduct had existed somewhere.  ID226,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1832,10,13,inform,The Penal Colonies. Botany Bay serves as a recipient for criminals whose reformation is hopeless and whom it is therefore desirable to remove from the Society to whose peace and security they are sworn enemies. This is the sole value of the colony. If it did not exist recourse would be had more frequently to perpetual imprisonment and the gibbet. Experience shews however that transportation does not produce the intended effect of terrifying the guilty. Its monitory operation depends greatly on the situation of the criminal. Agricultural labourers with families dread it extremely while to single men mechanics who are sure of receiving high wages and generally to all those who feel a desire of change and a vague expectation of pushing their fortunes it appears to hold out no terrors whatever. In the colony there is a competition among settlers to obtain convinct servants and those who get them endeavour from a regard to their own interest to render the situation of the convicts as little irksome as possible. The evidence proves that when the feeling degradation is once overcome the situation of the Australian convict is in many respects preferable to that of the agricultural labourer in this country : He has better clothing more abundant food and enjoys a finer climate. The hardship too of compulsory labour is but for a limited time. The convict who is transported for 7 years is allowed a Ticket of Leave at the end of 8years. Once possessed of this ticket he is allowed to work on his own account and with high wages easily acquires capital. The committee see little chance of rendering punishment effective in the colony. They recommend various subordinate regulations and among others they suggest as a remedy for the great expense attending transportation that no convict be assigned to a settler until he shall have paid or given security for the payment by instalments of the expense incurred in the conveyance of the convict from the mother country. We are satisfied that the true check to the increase of crime is to be found first in the diffusion of education and sound knowledge ; and second in the improvement of our judicial and municipal institutions. Law in all its important branches should be dispensed by paid and responsible persons. A judge ought to be stationed in each small district and keep open court every day of the year. He should be chosen by some popular constituency which would faithfully represent the feelings of the mass of suitors; and as a guarantee for his diligence he should hold his office only for seven years and be re-eligible. Justices of Peace if retained at all should be elected as in most of the American states by the householders for three four or seven years. Jails also should be placed under the controul of popular bodies and thrown open to the improving efforts of private benevolence. In this as in other points we have much to learn from the Americans who never forget that the criminal is still a man. The grand defect in our legislation has been that the rich made laws for the poor of whose situation they had scarcely any knowledge and with whose feelings wants and moral condition they had of course no sympathy. The unpaid Magistracy of Britain is a barbarism belonging to the tenth century. Thirty years hence men will wonder how their forefathers tolerated so monstrous a system.  ID228,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1833,06,29,inform,Emigration. –Within these few days other three vessels left Leith for America and Australia with emigrants.

It is intended to place the emigrants in divers situations and leave them free and not bound to an employer.  ID237,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1834,04,16,inform,Emigration to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land The following document has just been issued from the Colonial Office:– Downing street April 6 1834. Numerous applicants have been received from persons desirous of emigrating to New South Wales or Van Dieman's Land who after stating their inability to defray the whole charge of their conveyance solicit aid for that purpose on condition of repaying the same out of their earnings in the colony where they propose to settle. His Majesty's government has sanctioned the appropriate of a limited sum out of the colonial revenues of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land to assist the private funds of such emigrants as may appear likely to earn the means of repayig that aid and to become useful settlers. The following are the regulations under which this induglence will be dispensed:– No advance will be made except to young and married agricultural labourers who intend taking their wives and families with them : and a strict inquiry will be instituted into their character and habits of industry before the assistance they solicit will be granted to them. No one family will be allowed an advance exceeding t20; and it will be useful therefore for parties who may not possess the remainder of the sum requisite for defraying the expense of their passage to apply for assistance. Every person desirous of receiving the proposed advance must fill up and send back to the Under Secretary of State for the Colonial Department the return hereto annexed. If the information contained in this return and the answers to the inquiries which may be addressed to the parties who certify the correctness of the return shall be considered satisfactory the applicant will receive notice to that effect. He may then proceed to make his agreement with the owners or masters of ships proceeding to New South Wales or Van Diemen's land and as soon as any ship-owner or master shall notify (in a form which will be provided for that purpose) that the emigrant has taken the other necessary steps for engaging his passage and order will be granted for the payment in the colony of t20 to the agent or master of the vessel in which this emigrant may arrive. The emigrant will of course be able to[?] ob-[?] tain a corresponding deduction from the amount[?] [?] paid by himself in this country. The order for payment will be entrusted [?] ter of the vessel in which the emigrants to pro[?] and will consist of a sealed dispatch to the governor containing the name and description of the party on whose account the money is to be paid and encolosing a promissory note which he will be required to sign in acknowledgement of his debt ; which note must be witnessed by the captain and chief mate of the vessel. But arrangements will be made by which the payment of this order will not take place in the colony until the captain shall have produced the parties on whose account it is to be made before the officer appointed for that purpose and they shall have entered into a fresh obligation for the repayment of the advance made to them. For it is the intention of his Majesty's Government and cannot be too clearly understoof by all persons who may accept this loan that repayments of the debt (in such proportions and at such intervals as may not be unsuitable to the circumstances of each emigrant) shall be strictly enforced by means of the ample powers which the laws of the colony render available for that purpose. Government agents for emigration have been appointed at Liverpool Bristol Dublin Cork Limerick Belfast and Greenock who have been instructed to afford gratuitous information to all persons applying to them as to the best means of carrying their schemes of emigration into effect. Parties therefore who may reside in the neighbourhood of these agents are requested to apply to them either personally (or if by letter post paid) for information on this subject. All application for the assistance of government must be made by letter only addressed to R. W. Hay Esq. Under Secretary of State London ; and should the number of applications be greater than the funds at their disposal will enable them to comply with priority of date will form the rule of selection among applications in which there shall appear no other groun of distinction.

Mr W. Whitmore in the chair. Upon taking the chair Mr Whitmore stated that the first question which the meeting would have to consider would be this–whether there existed or not at present any necessity for a more extended system of colonization. It appeared to him that there was a great defect in our present system of colonication and that it would be greatly to our advantage if we established it upon a new principle well and seriously considered. That which struck him as the greatest defect was that we did not provided that colonization which included within it members of all classes of society. Large numbers of emigrants went out with capital but not carrying with them that number of the lower class which was necessary to employ their capital to advantage. In other cases perhaps almost as numerous the labourer went out without capital which was necessry to enable him to employ his labour to advantage. This was a striking defect. Now the question which they were then called upon to consider regarded the best means of remedying that defect. Those means it appeared to him were quite practicable and might be accomplished in this manner vz. by establishing as a system that all the waste lands which they were about to colonize should be sold at a given price such as the market would command and that the proceeds of such sales should be employed in sending out to the colonies a sufficient number of labourers to cultivate the lands so sold. If this system could be carried into effect he apprehended that all the evils of our present system of colonization would be removed and that we should be enabled to transplant a portion of the community of the mother country with all its various grades into the new country which they now proposed to coloniz. He believed that if we proceeded upon this principle we should lay the foundation of the greatest colony which England had ever settled. Mr Grote M.P. moved the first resolution–That the wealth and prosperity of this country have been greatly promoted by the establishment of British colonies in various parts of the world and that colonization when conducted systematically and upon sound principles offers the means of extending indefinitely the commercial empire of the united kingdom and the field of employment for British capital and labour. He would not enter into the recommendations which this undertaking offered to all classes of the community ; but he would venture to state that to any gentleman who considered the prospectus which had been put out by the association and who recollected that it was a matter of certainty that the land in the colony was to be used as the means of raising a fund to carry over thither the labour which was superabundant here it must be evident that from this important innovation on our colonial system great benefit must be derived[?] both to the new colony and to the mother country. Mr Clay M.P. in seocnding the resolution entered at great length into the difficulty of finding employment which now prevails in all parts of the community and then after condemning the corn laws continued thus–Colonization if carried on to a considerable extent would as effectually add millions of fertile acres to our shores as if the Irish sea were filled up with fertile land. If that miracle took place is it not clear that all distress would immediately cease and that the emplyment which the addition of so many fertile acres would afford must give a new stimulus to the prosperity of the country ? Is it not clear that the miserable compotation[?] for potato-gardens in Ireland would cease and that the difficulties flowing from an unemployed population would cease ? Does any man doubt that it would be well worth the while of our capitalists to take such land at from 10s to 20s an acre. (Hear.) Yet this plan is in effect the same as if the land were added to our own island because if this plan of colonization be adopted a transplantation of a sufficiency of labourers now wanting employment from this country for its culture will take place which is equivalent to the transportation of the land to the labourer. In point of fact the ocean joins these distant lands instead of separating them. (Hear.)– There can be no doubt but that a wider comercial code and the removal of restrictions on labour would greatly facilitate extend and increase the commercial intercourse between the old nation of the world ; but in no case would the increase be in proportion to that which might be calculated on as the consequence of a connection with newly-formed countries in other climates. As regards the establishment of colonies it is virtually an extension of the mother country. Colonel Torrens M.P. proposed the second resolution– That in establishing colonies great care ought to be taken to combine labour and capital with land in such proportions as are best calculated to insure the prosperity of all classes of society and that in establishing modern colonies this important consideration has been so generally overlooked. It was he said almost unnecessary for him to state that in all systems of colonization land labour and capital ought to be combinedin just proportions ; and yet this simple prin ciple had been hitherto greatly neglected by those who had led new colonies from the mother country. In the first place the whole of the land of this colony was to be public land. No individual was to obtain a single acre by gift. There was to be no patronage no job–all were to be on a footing of equality and nobody was to have a single inch of land for nothing. There would also be another advantage in this system which would arise in the following :–In other colonies the labourer who had gone out and found that he could get land for nothing had often fallen into the mistake that land was wealth instead of it being merely the means of producing wealth. That fatal mistake had often led him to refuse the work of the master with whom he had gone out and set up for himself as an independent landowner. He had in consequence set up where he was far away from the market of the colony where he had no roads over which to convey his produce and where he had perished miserably. But in this colony the labourers would be compelled for some time to work for hire. Mr Guest M.P. seconded the resolution. Mr Hutt M.P. moved the third resolution to the following effect:–That in order to promote the greatest prosperity of a new colony it is expedient that all waste land without any exception shall be declared public land and be disposed of to individuals by sale only and according to an uniform impartial and permanent system. Captain Gowan seconded the resolution and spoke in the highest terms of the salubrity of the climate of Australia. Many of his fellow soldiers in India had gone there for the recovery of their health and had found something so temperate and soothing in the country that they had retired there altogeher preferring its mild and gentle breeze to the chills of their native country England. Mr P. Scrope M.P. moved That it is also desirable that the whole of the purchase money of public land without any deduction should be employed in providing a free passage from the mother country to the colony of young adult persons of the labouring class who may be willing to emigrate and in equal proportion of both sexes. As the want of labour was the great difficulty in all infant colonies the more labour they imported the greater labour did they give their land ; the more they got for the sale of it the greater was their power of importing fresh labour. This resolution therefore acted in a reciprocal manner upon itself and when it was once fairly put into operation they would proceed onwards on the road to prosperity with accelerated velocity meeting with no other obstacle than the unwillingness of England to part with her inhabitants. Mr Wilks M.P. seconded the resolution. Mr Handson moved –That amongst the unoccupied portions of the earth which form part of the British dominions the south coast of Australia appears to be a sport peculiarly suitable for founding a colony upon the principles embodied in the preceding resolutions. The place where this colony was to be founded was one distinguished from every other part of Australia from its possessing a facility of internal communications prior even to the formation of roads and the soil would amply repay the labour expended on its cultivation. Mr Robert Owen (not of Lanark) said that the coasts of this colony abounded with whales and that its whale fisheries might become valuable. Mr M. D. Hill rose to propose the resolution embodying the mode of carrying the principles of this association into effect. No colony could go on without some law. He did not care how little they had of it provided they made up in quality what was deficient in quantity. The hon. member entered into an elaborate description of the laws intended to be enacted for the colony and concluded by moving–That the provisions for the peace order and good government of the British Province of South Australia as contained in the bill now before Parliament are highly satisfactory. Mr D. Wakefield seconded the resolution. Sir W. Molesworth M.P. proposed and Mr Childers M.P. seconded the following resolution :–That it is the opinion of this meeting that the thanks of the country are due to Mr Spring Rice for his prompt and enlightened conduct in promoting the beneficial public object of the South Australian Association. The resolutions were carried unanimously. Thanks were given to the Chairman and the meeting at which many ladies were present broke up. The proceedings lasted from twelve o'clock to a quarter before five.  ID243,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1834,08,02,inform,House of Commons.–July 28 (Continued from our last.) A message from the Lords announced that their Lordships had agreed to the Amendments to the Ministers Appointment (Scotland) bill ; to the Newspaper Postage bill ; and to the Orkney Statute Labour bill. Affairs of Oude On the order of the day for the third reading of the Universities' Admission bill being moved– Mr Herriks[?] took the occasion of calling on Government to explain the circumstances which had occurred in certain transactions between the Board of Controul and the East India directors. These transactions the hon. gentleman stated to be the repeated peremptory commands of the Board of Controul to the Directors of the East India Company to prepare a despatch for the purpose of directing the Indian Government to compel the King of Oude to pay certain claims made on him on behalf of Calcutta bankers which commands the Court of Directors refused to obey on the ground that the interference which the Board of Controul required them to exercise with the King of Oude was inconsistent with the relations subsisting between the British Government and the King of Oude and would be most mischievous in effect. On the 31st of January the right jon. gentleman had appliedfor and obtained a rule to show cause why under the act of Parliament a mandamus should not issue to compel the Court of Directors to comply with the desire ofthe Board of Controul. On the 31st of January 1834 the Court of King's bench was prepared to give its decision upon the application for the mandamus when without any reason being assigned the right hon. President of the Board of Controul withdrew his application. Mr C. Grant said that in the regret which had been expressed respecting the possible collision between the two authorities he fully concurred; bu entertaining such a sentiment he confessed it surprised him not a little to find his Right Hon. Friend endeavouring to open a dispute already composed. The right honourable gentleman then proceeded to give a brief outline of the case and referred to the various high authorities connected with India who had declared in favour of the demand. With regard to his having withdrawn the application for the mandamus without explanation he had to say that he fully explain his opinions to the Directors he had re-stated them verbally to the chairman and he did not think himself required under the circumstances to reenter into a long discussion upon the point. The effect of the recommendation to the King of Oude was merely to urge the claim upon his attention. Sir R. Peel said it was a perfectly novel doctrine and in the present state of the world most inconvenient that the nonpayment of debts due to his subjects should give the King of England a right forcibly to intervene with foreign states except where sanctioned by positive treaty. Mr Hume contended that on the whole the debt was a just one and ought to be paid. The subject here dropped. Admission of Dissenters to the Universities. On the question that this bill be read a third time Mr T. Gladstone rose to oppose it. It would he said be useless to pass the bill for it would of necessity be inoperative. If he were asked why he opposed a bill which if passed would be inoperative his answer was that he objected to its principle the admission of which was equally destructive whether it effected the object of its promoters or not. Further they were bound to respect corporate rights as long as the intentions of their founders were fulfilled ; and no one could deny that the Universities did fulfilthe intentions of their founders. (Hear hear.) Mr V. Smith supported the bill as one calculated to take away a reproach from the Establishment and be felt as a compliment by the Dissenters whose only desire was to exercise their vigorous intellects in the promotion of science and literature. Mr Baines said that the original statutes showed that there were then no tests nor did any exist at Oxford in either the time of the Lollards or of Wickliff. The term University had in it an argument for thegeneral use of these seats of learning which were meant to be universal both as to the subjects taught and the persons to whom they were communicated. In this sense the term was understood and applied in other countries and it was an extraordinary fact deserving of attention that the Universities of Oxford and of Cambridge were the only universities that were closed to a large proportion of the upper classes of the people in any country in Europe. This the Dissenters of England felt as a grievous indignity and they thought it unjust that Englishmen should attempt to degrade Englishmen by excluding them from the best seats of literature and science. Mr H. Hughes could not accede to the measure and therefore moved that it be read that day six months. Mr Goulburn contended that the introduction of the Dissenters as proposed under the present bill would be nothing short of the destruction of the present system of education at the Universities. It was indisputable that at a University religion could only be taught according to some set form : abandon that mode of tuition and you abandon the religion itself. (Cries of No no.) If they let in Dissenters it was perfectly obvious the intentions of the founders of those establishments would be completely defeated : he therefore deprecated the measures as injurious to religon and opposed to the best interest of the country. Lord Palmerstone Sir R. Inglis and Mr G. Wood then addressed the house but amidst such discordant noises as prevented what they said being heard. The laughing jeering shouting were such as has seldom been heard. In particular two hon. members who entered from the smoking room into the opposite gallery during the address of Mr Wood and who stretched themselves at full length on the seats secure from the observation of the Speaker kept up a row of the most discreditable character. The Speaker with much indignation in his tone and manner called the parties to order. The motion for the third reading was carried on a division by 164 to 25. The Trading Companies Bill the Arms Importation (Ireland) Bill and the Court of Chancery (Ireland) Bill went through committees. The Four Courts (Dublin) Bill the Weights and Measures Bill and the Turnpike Acts Amendment Bill were read a third time and passed. The Almanack Stamps Repeal Bill the Assessed Taxes Repeal Bill and the Militia Ballot Suspension Bill were brought in and read a first time. The house was counted out at three o'clock in the morning. Tuesday July 29. Sir John Cam Hobhouse and General Sir Edward Barnes took the oaths and their seats ; the former for Nottingham in the room of Lord Duncannon raised to the Peerage ; the latter for Sudbury in the room of M. A. Taylor Esq. deceased. On the motion of Mr Alderman Thompson the Durham and Sunderland Railway bill was read a third time and passed. Southern Australia Mr S. Rice moved the order of the day for the house to resolve into Committee upon the Bill for the Colonization of Southern Australia Mr A. Baring rose and stated various objections to the project. The hon. member contended that at this period of the year there was not time to deliberate upon such an important subject and independent of this preliminary objection he said he did not conceive that government ought to sanction any such experiment without a full conviction that there was a reasonable probability of its success. In his opinion the experiment was founded upon bases more mistaken than any similar one which had ever been tried. In fact according to the plan which had been laid down the colony would be tied up by mortgages in such a way that it would not again revert to the Crown so that the territory would be lost. The result would be that if the gentlemen who set the project on foot were mistaken–as he was sure they had been–we would be prevented from touching this large portion of Australia unless we could pay off the debt which had been contracted. While he stated these objections to the plan he was anxious not to be understood to be inimical to colonization for he was very favourable to it. Every new opening to colonization he was convinced was a substantial benefit to the poorer classes (Hear hear hear.) It was not therefore to the principle of colonization that he was opposed but he objected to this bill becaue the plan was a most mistaken one and would eventually shut up this large portion of the world. One of his main objections was to the extent to which it was proposed to carry the experiment. Let the gentlemen take if they like 100 square miles but let them not risk the whole of a great continent. People like fuel he said could not well be carried too far ; they might get a few thousands to go out but they would never get the tens of thousands to go which were required for the success of the project. The hon. member then objected to two of the principles which were laid down by the projectors that land should not be sold lower than 12s. per acre and that no credit should be given. He was convinced that any man acquainted with the practical workings of the system in other colonies would blow up the whole plan in a moment. No man who went out to Australia would think of taking less than two hundred acres. Now that would cost him t120; it would cost him t120 more to get himself and his family over; which with stock and other expenses would amount to t500 or t600. He would therefore ask any gentlemen in that house whether they thought any man who had t500 or t600 in this country would go out and set himself down on two hundred acres in Australia. (Hear hear.) He therefore suggested to his right hon. friend to consent that the committee be postponed until another session and then have it referred to a select committee. He concluded by moving as an amendment that the bill be committed on that day six months. Mr W. Whitmore was thakful for the very candid manner in which the hon. member had stated his objections to the bill. With respect to the large extent of territory he (Mr W.) thought that was necessary as it was intended to introduce a completely new system of colonization–one very different from any thing ever before attempted. The extent of land it was intended to take under this act was from 500000 to 600000 square miles and it was the leading principle of the bill that all the money arising from the sale of lands should be applied to the purpose of sending out labourers free of expense.– (Hear hear hear.) If this plan succeeded there would be a constant stream of emigrants going out. The land sold by the Canada Company had been at a higher price. He had sanguine hopes that all the money it would be necessary to borrow would be easily repaid. He most conscientously considered that this bill would prove a very great benefit to the country. It would tend exceedingly towards facilitating and amending the conditions of the people of England and Ireland and therefore he hoped it would pass. Mr O'Dwyer contended that before the house thought of agreeing to such a bill as this they ought to do something towards the ameloriation of the condition of the people of Ireland. The various reports which committees of that house had made showed that one-fourth of the land of that country was untilled but was at the same time what was called reclaimable land and well calculated for the cultivation and produce of grain. Let this country advance some of the surplus capital talked of by the hon. member towards the cultivation of this bog land and discontent would flee[?] from Ireland entirely. The Irish people wanted employment give them that and the house would hear no more about murders fires and other outrages. Mr S. Rice in reference to the allusion made by the hon. and learned member begged to say that although much of the bog land in question belonged to private individuals yet a portion of it was the property of the Government who had been and still were making experiments with a view to ascertain if the views of the Commissioners could be carried into effect. With respect to the manner in which the hon. member for Essex had opened this question he must confess that he had brought with him much of usefulness and of experience and of such a character too as could not fail to carry weight. The right hon. gentleman then proceeded to speak in favour of the proposed colonization of South Australia After some farther discussion strangers were ordered to withdraw and the house divided when there appeared–For going into committee 72; against it 7–Majority 65. The bill went through the committee. The report was received and ordered to be taken into further consideration on Thursday next. Several petitions were presented and at three o'clock the Speaker left the chair.  ID246,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1834,11,08,inform,Emigration. –According to a general return of emigrants who have left Liverpool for the British colonies and the United States of America it appears that from the 7th of May 1833 to the 30th September 1834 3121 persons left there for the colonies and 27486 for the United States making a grand total of 30607 persons. The ships employed were 455 ; the tonnage 196058 and the crews 89956. The chief of the emigrants to the United States disembarked at New York 24311 having landed there. Of the emigrants to the colonies 1289 went to Australia and 1227 to Quebec. The emigration to the West Indies during the above period only amounted to 12 to the smaller islands 3 to Antigua 32 to Jamaica and 26 to Demerara.

We may therefore expect shortly to see the names of the various officers gazetted (some of them have been long ago nominated) ; and we understand that active preparations are making with a view to the immediate departure of the officers and a small body of emigrants. This first expedition will be placed under the command of Captain Hindmarsh R.N. the Governor ; who with the assistance of the Surveyors and other qualified persons will carefully examine the various harbours in the colony the quality of the neighbouring soil the supply of water &c. ; and will select that site which all things considered is most desirable for the first town. We believe it is the intention of the Commissions not to send out the main body of emigrants until the next spring so as to allow ample time for the necessary preparations for their reception.– Spectator. There have been 300 convents suppressed within the last three years. The example was set by the Emperor of Russia who was by an ukase dated 31st July 1832 abolished 187 convents of monks. This was followed by the King of Prussia who by a royal order secularised all the convents in the Duchy of Posen. In 1834 Don Pedro put down 300 convents and Spain has lately abolished 1800.  ID253,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1836,03,12,inform,Emigration. –It will be observed from an advertisement in to-day's paper that Government are fitting another ship for the free conveyance of single females from London to Van Dieman's Land ; and from the great demand for agricultural labourers and mechanics of every description in that colony it has been resolved to grant a passage to that class at a cost not above what is paid to America–Government paying the remainder of the sum as a bounty amounting to t30 which may certainly be looked upon as a great boon both by individuals and the colony at large. In all the colonies there appears to be a scarcity of working people as from an official document in our possession it is asserted on authority that in Upper Canada agricultural labourers domestic servants and tradesmen of every description will be for some years in great request. Farm labourers readily obtain from t25 to t30 per annum with board lodging and washing and day-labourers from 3s. to 4s. per day with provisions. The government agent for emigration for the Canadas asserts he could find immediate employment for 20000 working people as public improvements are much retarded for want of hands. As this is the best season we would advise all those intending to emigrate to apply to the government agent for emigration at the Custom House Leith who will give gratuitous information regarding the colonies and advise as to the best method of putting their plans into execution.

In this letter Mr Sullivan mentions that the female emigrants on landing were placed in spacious and commodious buildings adjoining the Government House at Sydney where every attention was paid to their comfort and security from improper intrusion. The writer further states :– We landed in Sydney a greater proportion of well conducted industrious and virtuous young women than were ever before landed from any of the ships of the Emigration Committee that came to these Colonies. Three-fourths of the young women were engaged and went into comfortable situations on the first and second days after landing ; and before a week all the useful and good servants viz. laundresses cooks servants of all work dairymaids and housekeepers were in places many of them in Syndey and the surroundings districts ; several were taken up the country to Maitland and Bathurst ; and as many more cooks laundresses dairymaids or farm servants as we had could obtain places in that time for these are the descriptions of female servants in demand throughout the colony. The wages varied from t8 to t20. Some who were not very good servants of all work and housemaids got t8 to t10 ; cooks and laundresses t12 to t16 (the latter are much wanted) ; housemaids and needlewomen t10 to t12 ; housekeepers t16 to t20. Governesses also are much sought for it ; if we had had twenty qualified they could have got situations in respectable families and schools ; but the salaries to this class are small say t25 to t40. Nursery governesses got t20. All the male emigrants who understood agriculture or the management of stock in general but particularly sheep were engaged immediately at salaries varying from t40 to t50 with a house and rations for family use. We understand that the Canton had a number of females from Edinburgh and its neighbourhood and the above information must be highly satisafactory to their relatives.  ID258,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1836,05,18,inform,Papers from Madras to the 17th of January have been received.

The Charles Eaton was supposed to have been lost on the Barrier Reef in Torres Straits in 1833 in prosecution of her voyage from New South Wales to Madras but no precise intelligence of her fate was previously known.

He had been assured y several gentlemen who had returned from Van Diemen's land that many of the young females sent out by the Emigration committee had been irrevocable consigned to prostitution and that such as obtained services found themselves placed among a very different calss of persons to that which they had been accustomed to mix with in this country. The hon. member read an extract from a Hobart Town paper of the 19th of February last in which it was stated that some of the females thus launched into the world were not more than twelve of thirteen years old. Mr Wakley seconded the motion. Sir G. Grey adverted to the extraordinary object of the address when the information desired had in fact already been given on a former day. He hoped whatever information correct or erroneous might be circulated on the subject of emigration that the people of England would not adopt their notions from anonymous paragraphs in Hobart Town newspapers. According to the hon. member there was a system in operation by which people were driven out of the country–actually turned out of it as if they were so many slaves. Now he could declare that there could be no more unfounded statement than this. Though much good had arisen to the colonies and individuals yet it could not be denied that in some instances youn women had turned out badly They had these facts upon authority–that many of those females obtained respectable places. The names of the individuals who obtained them the dates of their arrival the mode of their meployment were all to be found int he papers on the table of the house. In conclusion he begged of the hon. member and others when statements relative to emigration were made to receive them with caution and reserve. Mr C. Lushington defended the proceedigs of the Emi gration Committee. he mainted that by their labours the greatest posible good had been accomplished hear hear.) He would then ask of any one to look at the names of the gentlemen who were on that committee–to look at their characters; and could any one who did so believe that the members of that committee would be guilty of the sin of sendng out day after day young females to the colonies–of thus duping those unprotected creatures to their destruction? (hear hear.) Mr Walter replied. He had not relied for his state ments upon newspapers but upon official documents. The motion was negatived without a division.  ID261,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1836,07,06,inform,State of Trade. The Wool Trade London Thursday Evening. –The following are more accurate averages of the sales of Colonial Wools which have recently taken place than we were enabled to obtain during their progress. The Colonial Wools offered consisted of 2041 bays.

This vessel contains 131 emigrants of the following descriptions: 37 young married couples having 32 young children ; 9 young bachelors and 7 young spinsters some of whom are expected to marry on the passage ; 2 carpenters of maturer age engaged to superintend the erection of forty wooden houses which constitute the principal cargo of the ship.  ID265,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1836,12,07,persuade,South Australia We have received the first annual Report of new colony of South Australia a Parliamentary paper presented in June last. The site selected for the colony is a part of the south coast of New Holland extending two or three hundred miles on each side of Spencer's Gulf and about 600 miles into the interior. It was anticipated that the best central station would be Port Lincoln at the entrance of Spencer's Gulf on the west side or Nepean Bay on the north coast of Kangaroo Isle. Port Lincoln is in latitude 35 and east longitude 136 about 700 miles right west from Sydney the same distance north-west from Van Diemen's Land and about 1000 miles eastward of the colony at King George's Sound. Nepean Bay is about 100 miles east from Port Lincoln. The colony is established under Parliamentary Commissioners as an experiment we believe to try whether it may not be possible to execute an extensive plan of emigration without any charge to the country by selling lots of land at such a price as would defray the expense of conveying the emigrants from England. The plan adopted is to send out preferably young married persons under thirty and to admit no slaves or convicts into the colony. A company has embarked t35000 in the enterprise. A surveying vessel was sent out in March to examine the coast carefully that the best site might be chosen at first and the necessity of removal avoided. Six vessels altogether had sailed down to the 1st May carrying out 152 male labourers with 37 females and 26 male and 10 females of a superior class. These numbers include 26 children. The Commissioners attempted at first to get 20s. per acre for the land ; but finding it impossible they reduced the price to 12s. By selling at this price 437 lots consisting each of a country section of 134 acres and a town section of one acre they had raised the t35000 required by the act of Parliament as the condition of the grant of land. We give these few details to put our readers in a condition to understand the notices which appear from time to time in the papers respecting the colony. We hope the Commissioners or the adventurers will give the country a distinctive name. The title of South Australia is bad any way and even positively absurd ; since Australia ( quasi Australasia) originally intended for New Holland has already begun to be monopolised by Van Diemen's Land. The district at Spencer's Gulf if it is to participated in the general denomination should be termed North rather than South Australia. By the way most of our colonies in that quarter of the world have ridiculous names as is instantly perceived when we coin a nationa term for the people out of them. What can be worse than a Van Diemen-lander ; a New South-Wales-ian ; a Swan River-ite ; or a King-George's Soundian ! !  ID266,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1837,05,10,inform,New Holland. –The Government intend to move in the House of Commons the grant of t1000 to defray a portion of the charge of an expedition to be despatched for the purpose of exploring the north-west part of New Holland agreeably to recommendations of the Royal Geographical Society to ascertain the existence or the contrary of any great river in the north-west portion of New Holland.  ID267,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1837,06,07,inform,Religion in Australia. –An Act of Council has passed to the effect that whenever t300 are raised for the erection of a church and parsonage the Government may advance the same sum–and that if one hundred adults sign a declaration of their wish for a clergyman a salary of t100 may be given–if two hundred a salary of t150 and if five hundred a salary of t200.

She has been chartered by Government; and will acommodate upwards of three hundred emigrants.  ID270,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1837,11,22,inform,Thus the British Government is multiplying its colonies round the shores of New Holland. Exclusive of Van Diemen's Land which forms a separate island we have first on the eastern shore the old settlement of Port Jackson ; a second recently formed at Port Philip 500 miles south from Sidney ; a third just described at St. Vincent's Gulf 500 miles west from Port Philip ; a fourth at King George's Sound 1100 miles west from St Vincent's Gulf ; a fifth at Swan River 250 miles north from King George's South. All these colonies are in the temperate zone between the latitudes of 30 and 38 and will have nearly the same climate. We had one at Melville Island on the north coast within the torried zone in latitude 12 ; but it was found to be very unhealthy and was abandoned after a short trial ten years ago. Though the interior of New Holland so far as hitherto explored is one of the most barren and unpromising lands in the world there is a margin of good soil round the greater part of its coasts capabale [?] of supporting twenty or thirty or fifty mil lions of inhabitants; and there is little doubt that in the course of three centuries it will be the seat of a great and powerful nation cultivating the arts and speaking the language of Britain and contributing powerfully to spread civilisation over the Southern Hemisphere.  ID271,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1838,06,09,inform,Emigration The Annual Report on Emigration just issued contains besides the usual correspondences and documents connected with the plan which has been some time in operation of transferring labourers from India to the Mauritius and which it is now proposed to extend to New South Wales. Leaving this subjest for the present we shall state the general results[?] of the emigration to Canada. The Report shows that the whole number of emigrants who landed at Quebec or Montreal in the last nine years was 259788[?] averaging very nearly 29000 per annum. The years of greatest emigration were 1831 and 1832 the numbers for these years being respectively 50254 and 51746. The proportions[?] [?] furnished by the three kingdoms in the nine years were as follows :–Among eight emigrants there were five Irishmen two Englishmen and one Scotsman. Scotland in proportion to its population has sent off three times as many emigrants and Ireland about nine times as may as England; and it should be added that a certain part of the emigration from England is artificial consisting of paupers sent out at the expense of their parishes. Emigrations offers the most natural practicable and safe means of relieving a country of its redundant or unemployed population ; and it may be asked why it is so much less resorted to in England than in Scotland and Ireland? It cannot[?] be the ignorance of the English for this would lead to the inference that the Irish who emigrate in the largest numbers were the best informed of the three nations. It is we apprehend nothing but the Poor Laws which hold out to the labourer the certainty of a subsistence at home however idle or improvident he may be and render him averse to live in the colonies where he would have no such resource. This is only one of the many evils which these laws have pro duced not only to the country at large but to the labouring classes themselves whose average condition was greatly deteriorated while only a fraction of their number shared the benefit of the allowance. We speak of the Poor Laws as they existed before the Act of 1834 was passed. The number of emigrants who went to Canada last year was 21901 of whom 1399 went from Scotland 5580 from England 14538 from Ireland and 274 from Nova Scotia Newfoundland or the West Indies. In 1836 the number of emigrants was 27728. The ports in Scotland from which the greatest numbers sail are Greenock Leith Aberdeen and Cromarty. Of the emigrants in 1837 4000 settled in Lower Canada 16300 in Upper Canada 1500 went to the United States and ninety-two died in the hospital or quarantine station. In the same period of nine years 236288[?] British emigrants have landed at new York or fully 26000 per annum on average. There is a great fluctua-[?] tion in the number. In 1833 and 1835 it was only 16000 ; in 1837 it was 34000 ; in 1836 no less than 59075 ; and addingthe 27728 who went to Canada no less than 86800 persons must have landed at New York and Quebec from the British Isles in [?]. There is a discrepancy however between this account and another in a different Return also newly published. The Report of the Agent-General for Emigration makes the number who went to the United States from Britain in 1836 only 37774. The former probably comprehends all British born subjects including persons from Nova Scotia Canada and the West Indies and probably all passengers many of whom returned. The Agent-General gives the number of persons who emigrated to the British Colonies and the United States for every year since 1825. We present merely the average for the last year seven years. Annual number of Emigrants from Britain to North American Colonies 39[?]00 Ditto do. to United States 34[?]00 Ditto do. to Cape of Good Hope 20[?] Ditto do. to Australian Colonies 3[?]0 73[?][?] In 1832 the number who emigrated to these Colonies was no less than 103140. The number who went out to Australia in 1837 was much greater than in any preceding year being 5054. If we assume that each emigrant pays for his passage &c. or has in his pocket t30 the average net[?] expended on emigration will be about two millions per annum. It may be correctly stated now that human beings form no inconsiderable item in number and value of our exports. In the case of Ireland we suppose it is by far the most flourishing and by no means the least advantageous branch of the national commerce. The annual increment of the population of British Isles is about 330000 independently of the efflux by emigration ; but including this it must be about 420000. It follows that there are about [?] more inhabitants in the country each day than there were on the day before. Of the 1150 additional mortals[?] emigration carries off 200. The establishment of steam navigation across the Atlantic will no doubt give a new impulse to the circulation of human beings while the construction of railroads across the Alleganies and of canals in Canada will greatly increase the capacity of the western world to absorb the imported multitudes. In seven years hence the journey from London to Missouri will be shorter in point of time and perhaps cheaper than the journey from Washington to Missouri was seven years ago. A religious man might see something like the finger of Providence in the fact that just at the time France Germany the Netherlands and Switzerland begin to feel severely the pressure of a redundant population inventions have started into existence which may be said to annihilate space and bring the most thinly inhabited parts of the world into juxtaposition with the most overpeopled. From the American Almanac we find that the number of passengers who arrived in the United States in 1836 was 81000 of whom 4000 were native Americans. The proportion of emigrants from the different foreign countries was– From the British Isles 47792 ... British American Colonies 2681 ... Germany 20142 ... France 4443 ... Prussia 563 ... Switzerland 465 ... Denmark 414 ... Holland 298 ... Mexico 797 ... Texas 698 ... Cuba 516 ... Other countries 2152 Some curious inferences might be drawn from this table as to the motives which induce men to leave their native country. Celeris paribus there is most emigration where there is most intelligence. Thus Spain Portugal Sardinia Naples the Papal States and Austria furnish no emigrants to American while Britain and Germany furnish a vast number. Much however must depend on the domestic condition of the country and on the greater or less facilities for removing. Thus considering its inland position and the small number of its inhabitants the spirit of emigration must be much more active in Switzerland which sends out 445 persons than in France which sends out 4443. The magistrates of New York it appears consider the influx of emigrants a nuisance and it would seem from an expression of Mr Buchanan's the agent at Quebec that they had laid a tax of ten dollars upon all who arrive with an intention of settling. The key to this proceeding is no doubt to be found in the following facts. A Board of Aldermen reported in June last that the expense of City Almshouses in the preceding year were 205500 dollars or t44000 ; that of 1209 persons admitted in a certain period 932 were aliens ; and that the whole number under the charge of the Commissioners was 3074 of whom three-fourths were foreigners. A communication from the Mayor at the same time says:– Nearly 2000 emigrants arrive each week ; our streets are filled with the wandering crowds of those passengers clustering in our city unaccustomed to our climate without money without employment without friends many not speaking our language without any dependence for food or rainment[?] or fireside. In Boston and Philadelphia also nearly one-half of the inmates of the almshouses were foreigners.  ID272,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1838,09,22,inform,Emigration to Australia. –Several vessels have sailed within the last three weeks for our settlements in the souther hemisphere with full cargoes of goods and a large number of passengers.

Since that time he had had a communication from Lord Glenelg which he was sure would be received by the Commission with great satisfaction. The communication from Lord Glenelg was then read. It consisted of a copy of the despatch transmitted to the Governor of New South Wales approving of his conduct in withholding the salaries of the Presbyterian laymen who had not submitted themselves to the authority of the Presbytery in connection with the Church of Scotland and further directing that Dr Lang's salary should be discontinued. His lordship explained that in doing this the Government had no wish to constitute themselves judges in any ecclesiastical disputes ; but as the salaries awarded to these gentlemen had been given on the faith that they were to remain in connection with the Church of Scotland they could not be continued so long as they defied her authority. On the motion of Mr Dunlop the Commission unanimously expressed their satisfaction with the promptitude and decision which the Government had shown in the matter ; and directed the Moderator to communicate their minute to Lord Glenelg. It was also agreed to re-appoint the Committee to watch over the farther proceedings especially as it was understoof that Dr Lang was now on his way to this country. Case of Small Isles. –The Commission then proceeded to take up the case of Small Isles which it will be recollected arose out of the Rev. Mr M'Lean having as was alleged appeared in the lobby of the Assembly House while that Court was sitting in May last in a state of intoxication. The case occupied the Court a considerable part of the day; and at the evening sederunt the following motion by Dr Gardner was unanimously agreed to–That the Commission having considered the evidence on the record find that in as far as that evidence is hearsay it is inadmissable; but find it proved that on the afternoon of Friday the 25th of May last Mr M'Lean was seen in a state of intoxication in the vestibule of the General Assembly attempting to force his way into it; that it is proved he was on two other occasions during the sitting of last Assembly in a state of intoxication; and therefore they find that he ought to be deposed from the office of the holy ministry and direct the Moderator accordingly to pronounce the sentence of deposition directing the Clerk to transmit an extract of the sentence to the Presbytery of Skye and them to declare the parish of Small Isles vacant.–The Moderator pronounced from the chair the sentence os deposition. Case of Lethendy. –In the course of the proceedings during the early sederunt of the Commission the Procurator rose and said he might take the present opportunity of stating to the Commission that within the last three or four days a petition and complaint had been given in to the Court of Session and appointed to be served at the instance of Mr Clark presentee to the parish of Lethendy against the Presbytery of Dunkeld and Mr Kessen whom that Presbytery had lately inducted into that charge in despite of interdicts issued by the Court of Session. He mentioned the fact to that Commission presuming that they would authorize him to defend the Presbytery who had acted under authority of the Commission itself. Mr Buchanan of Glasgow after some remarks in commendation of the firmness of the Presbytery in carrying through the settlement amidst many difficulties moved that The Commission sanction the Procurator's defending the Presbytery in the trying circumstances in which they are placed and resolve that they will to the utmost of their power encourage and support them under whatsoever difficulties they may be subjected by their execution of the sentence of the Commission ; and that the thanks of the Commission be given to the Presbytery for the decision and temperate firmness with which they have practically maintained the rightful authority and jurisdiction of the Church. Dr Bryce said he was quite unprepared for any motion on this subject; but with the views which he entertained in regard to this case it was impossible he could concur in the motion proposed and he must therefore dissent from it. Mr James Bridges expressed great indignation against Mr Clark for thus bidding defiance to the authority of the Church Courts and he proposed that for thus trampling on the rights and dignity of the Church Mr Clark should be forthwith called before the Commission for an exemplary punishment.–Mr Dunlop suggested that although he concurred in feeling with Mr Bridges it would be premature at present to take any steps against Mr Clark inasmuch as there was no official communication on the subject from the Presbytery of Dunkeld. Mr Makgill recommended to Mr Bridges for this reason not to press his motion declaring that as at this time 200 years ago eight Bishops had been deposed he trusted the time was not far distant when Mr Clark would receive a similar reward for his misconduct; and Mr M. said emphatically that whatever the Presbytery of Dunkeld might suffer for upholding the independence of the Church he as a member of Commission by whose orders they had acted would be proud to bear his share. Mr bridges then intimated that he would waive pressing his motion and Mr Buchanan's was adopted Dr Bryce and Mr W. Malcolm intimating their dissent on the ground that it was incompetent and inexpedient for the Commission to adopt such a resolution. Commemoration of the Second Centenary of the Celebrated Assembly at Glasgow. –In the course of the day the Moderator suggested that as this was the second centenary of the great Assembly at Glasgow which might be considered as the founder not only of their ecclesiastical but of their civil liverties a meeting should be held exclusively devoted to prayer and thanksgiving to Almighty God for the benefits conferred on their Zion. At seven o'clock accordingly several of the members and a considerable number of people assembled when an hour was spent in devotional exercises which were conducted by Drs Muir Lee and Dickson in succession. The Commission adjourned to the second Tuesday in February next.  ID281,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1839,07,25,inform,Emigration to South Australia –On Saturday last about twenty-five persons male and female left this town and neighbourhood under the direction of Mr G.

The wounded man was taken to the Infirmary in a very dangerous state and the assailant to the jail. It appears that the young man has for some time past been behaving in a manner which made his friends chary of intrusting him with money in this country and that they had employed the individual referred to to see him on board for Australia before leaving any under his charge.

The woodland wild ! –where the dun deer roam And the song-birds build them a happy home– Where the grass is green and the turf so sweet Seems shorn by the tread of fairy feet– Where the daylight comes so richly dim And the cushat's coo seems a hermit's hymn The care-worn heart might be self-beguiled To forget its woes in the woodland wild !

The woodland wild !–If thy heart be pure If thy faith in the right be firm and sure Go wander the woodlands parth within And the love of Nature woo and win; Drink of the cup of beauty there Where the breath of Omnipotence scents the air; For the Father of beauty in love hath smiled On the sweet green bowers of the woodland wild The woodlan wild !–long long ago I have buried myself its leaves below And dreamed of its beauteous tenants all– 'Tis the linnet's home and fairies' hall!

The woodland wild !–what pleasant stories Make sunlight over its olden glories– Of Robin Hood and his bowmen bold The raids they made and the tales they told ! In winter in spring and in summer time The glorious forests are aye in prime ; For glad thoughts forever are round them piled Those grassy glades in the woodland wild! The woodland wild!–make haste.–make haste! Away with me and its gladness taste; We will wander beside each gushing stream Where flowers in the water reflected gleam; We will follow its paths and pluck its flowers And lie on its grass in the evening hours Till the dying sunlight soft and mild Warns us away from the woodland wild !

The Duke is a great advocate for colonization and to him the promoters of colonization of South Australia were in a great measure indebted for securing the enactment of the statute which gave effect to the principles on which that colony is founded ; and as many of the promoters of South Australian emigration are Directors of the New Zealand Company they have resolved setting all party politics aside to confer this honour on the Duke. There could be no stronger proof of the political sagacity and statesmanlike views of the Duke than his approval of the Wakefield system of colonization and no better mode of perpetuating his name than by bestowing it on the metropolis of the Great Britain of the Southern Hemisphere.  ID292,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1840,07,29,inform,Deputation of Distressed Weavers. –The distress of the Paisley weavers has caused them to send a deputation to London which on Tuesday waited on Lord John Russell to solicit the means of transporting themselves out of the ungrateful country which has been enriched by their toils and in return refuses them the means of subsistence.

F.R.G.S. 2 vols. London: Richard Bentley. We have been somewhat disappointed in these volumes. We expected to have found them like Scoresby's full of interesting details regarding whale fishing whereas there is hardly a word on the subject throughout the whole of the first volume and very little in the second ; in fact what there is is confined to a sort of supplementary appendix. This is the more strange that one of the chief purposes of the author as he himself informs us in undertaking this voyage was to investigate the anatomy and habits of southern whales and the mode of conducting the sperm whale fishery subjects which he remarks were then untouched by the literature of any country. Yet in the work itself this chief purpose dwindles into one of very secondary prominence. This the readers of the work at least most of them will the more regret on finding how very curious and interesting are the two or three chapters which the author has given on the subject of South Sea whaling. There are full of entertaining details of both a popular and scientific character and cannot be read without exciting a wish that larger portion of the work had been composed of such material. In making these remarks however we are far from intending to depreciate the sort of information in the shape chiefly of sketches of the South Sea Islands to which the greater part of the volumes are devoted ; we mean merely to say that it is not what we expected from the title of the work nor we may add what for our own reading we should have preferred. Yet are these sketches very amusing reading–full of graphic descriptions and curious details of native character which is still found in the South Sea Islands in a state of very primitive simplicity. We have frequently seen says Mr Bennett amongst the congregagation assembled at Church (in Raiatea) a native clothed in nothing but a shirt ; another with a beaver hat surmounting a person naked except the scanty maro ; and a third whose whole attire was a black coat white neckerchief and a shirt! We observe a rather odd circumstance noted by Mr Bennett. He says that the temperate ships of America are the principal purveyors of ardent spirits to the natives of the South Sea Islands carrying large quantities of rum thither for the purposes of traffic! This is placing the temperance principle in a somewhat curious predicament. Another remark of the author's not less striking–mark it well and take comfort from it ye bon vivants[?] of the civilzed world–is that disease is as abundant amongst the native islanders as amongst the most refined of their species and from this concludes that man in his savage state is as liable to the ills that flesh is heir to as in his civilised condition. Dr Johnson made a similar remark regarding the Highlanders of Scotland ; alleging that the London alderman lived as long over his turtle feast as the Highlander over his paten cake. What degree of fellow-feeling with civic dignitary and his good living or whether any dictated this remark of the learned doctor we cannot say. Mr Bennett's work is written with great ability and in style whose only fault is exhibited in a tendency occasionally to the use of rather learned phraseology. We conclude with an extract from that portion of the work which from its great interest we regretted was not larger but which limited as it is is so full of curious information and so crowded with remarkable incident as to render the selection by no means an easy task. Some sperm whales appear reluctant to employ their tail when attacked but prove active and dangerous with their jaws. Such individuals often rather seek than avoid the attacking boats and rushing upon them with open mouth employ every possible art to crush them with their teeth and if successful will sometimes continue in their neighbourhood biting the wreck and oars into small fragments. When thus threatening a boat the whale usually turns and swings upon its back and will sometimes act in a very sluggish and unaccountable manner keeping its formidable lower jaw suspended for some moments over the boat in a threatening attitude but ultimately rolling to one side and closing its mouth harmlessly ; nor is it rare to observe this whale when pursued and attacked retain[?] its mouth in an expanded state for some minutes together. Such threatening demonstrations of the jaw as well as some others with the flukes occasionally compel a boat's crew to leap into the water and support themselves by swimming or clinging to oars until the danger has passed. In the year 1835 the ship Pusie Hall encountered a fighting whale which after injuring and driving off her four boats pursued them to the ship and withstood for some time the lances hurled at it by the crew from the bows of the vessel before in could be induced to retire ; in this affair a youth in one of the boats was destroyed by a blow from the whale and one of the officers was severely lacerated by coming in contact with the animal's jaw. A highly tragical instances of the power and ferocity occasionally displayed by the sperm whale is recorded in the fate of the American South-Seaman Essex Captain G. Pollard. This vessel when cruising in the Pacific Ocean in the year 1820 was wrecked by a whale under the following extraordinary circumstances. The boats had been lowered in pursuit of a school of whales and the ship was attending them to windward. The master and second mate were engaged with whales they had harpooned in the midst of the school and the chief mate had returned on board to equip a spare boat in lieu of his own which had been broken and rendered unserviceable. While the crew were thus occupied the look-out at the masthead reported that a large whale was coming rapidly down upon the ship the mate hastened his task in the hope that he might be ready in time to attack it. The Cachalot which was of the largest size consequently a male and probably the guardian of the school in the meanwhile approached the ship so closely that the although the helm was put up to avoid the contact he struck her a severe blow which broke off a portion of her keel. The enraged animal was then observed to retire to some distance and again rush upon the ship with extreme velocity. His enormous head struck the starboard bow beating in a corresponding portion of the planks and the people on board had barely time to take to their boats before the ship filled with water and fell over on her side. She did not sink however for some hours ; and the crew in the boats continued near the wreck until they had obtained a small supply of provisions when they shaped a course for land ; but here it is to be regretted they made a fatal error. At the time the accident happened they were cruising on the Equator in the longitude of about 118[?] degrees West with the Marquesan and Society Islands on their lee and might have sailed in their boats to either of those groups in a comparatively short time. Under an erroneous impression however that all those lands were inhabited by an inhospitable race of people they preferred pulling to windward for the coast of Peru and in the attempt were exposed for a lengthened period in extreme privations. A few Cachalots have been noted individually as animals dangerous to attack. One was thus distinguished on the cruising ground off the coast of New Zealand and was long know to whalers by the name of 'New Zealand Tom.' He is said to have been of great size conspicuously distinguished by a white hump ; and famous for the havoc he had made amongst the boats and gear of ships attempting his destruction. A second example of cimilar celebrity was known to whalers in the Straits of Timor. He had so often succeeded in repelling the attacks of his foes as to be considered invincible but was at length despatched by a whaler who forewarned of his combative temper adopted the expedient of floating a cask on the sea to withdraw his attention from the boats ; but notwithstanding this ruse the animal was not destroyed without much hard fighting nor until the bow of one of the boats had been nipped off by his jaws.  ID295,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1840,10,28,inform,William The Missionary. –The sum already subscribed for the widow and family of this deeply lamented individual amounts to t1658 18s. 10d.

The hall was crowded to excess and it was perfectly evident from the first that the Chartists had mustered in great strength to carry out their usual course of obstruction to the particular business of the evening.–Mr T. Gillespie proposed a resolution in favour of emigration to New Zealand through the medium of funds raised by the sale of lands in the colony and addressed the meeting at some length in support of the resolution.–Mr R. Malcolm jun. a young lad and a Chartist spouter after a long speech proposed an amendment; to the effect that while the meeting was favourable to emigration to New Zealand or any other part of the world by those so disposed they objected to any application being made for a grant of public money for any such purpose–that they were opposed to the question of emigration being allowed to occupy public attention &c. and concluded with the statement that emigration would not afford even temporary relief to the oppressed operatives and that bad laws were the chief cause of all their present sufferings &c. This amendment which was supported by the most trifling arguments we ever heard brought forward in public was of course loudly cheered by the Chartists. The Lord Provost repeatedly explained that he had agreed to take the chair on the understanding that the subject of emigration to New Zealand was to occupy the attention ; but here a matter perfectly foreign to the business for which they were convened was introduced by way of amendment ; there was an attack made upon the general policy of the country–and he had positively to state that if such an amendment was carried he would not remain in the chair. This was received by cries for a new chairman and much confusion one party cheering and the other hissing and yelling alternately during the greater part of the evening. A discussion followed in which a boy named Jack took a prominent part ; and it became perfectly evident that the Chartist speakers were woefully ignorant of the subject they had the impudence to discuss. It was gravely and indignantly averred that by going to New Zealand the working men would incur the risk of being swallowed by cannibals! Till informed of the contrary the Chartists seemed to think that the means of emigration were to be supplied from the public exchequer ; and when told that the funds were to be raised by the sale of lands in New Zealand one of them sagely observed that it would be much more humane and just to appropriate the proceeds of those sales of land to employ it in sending out emigrants ! Another favourite argument was that every person had a right to subsist in the land that gave him birth and that it was barbarous and cruel to send a man however wretched out of his native country ; also that emigration would produce no benefit to society at home as the places of those sent off would soon be filled by others. Of course if these arguments had always been held good and acted upon the whole human family would to this day have been crowded together in the cradle of our race in the East provided only the thing had been possible; the extension of mankind to other parts of the world must have been wicked and cruel and useless–for for every inhabitant of a country is entitled to a subsistence in the land that gave him birth and on his removal to another land his place would just be filled by others ! The above is a mere specimen of the worse than childish arguments used by the Chartist spouters and which the men who are now knocking loudly at the door of the constitution for admission cheered as if they had been fraught with the choicest wisdom !–Mr John Crawford Secretary to the New Zealand Land Company endeavoured by some sensible remarks to place the question of emigration to New Zealand on its proper footing ; but in vain ; they were determined to have the charter only–and till then starving workmen willing but unable to emigrate must starve on. On a division the amendment proposed by Mr Malcolm was carried by a large majority and after a vote of thanks had been given to the Lord Provost the meeting broke up. This was not done however till the Chartists were called upon to be at their posts at the meeting to be held to-day to address the Queen–to render themselves of course a little more odious by another stretch of their obstructive power–if they can.  ID297,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1841,03,20,inform,On Monday a discussion of some interest took place in the House of Commons relative to the affairs of South Australia. Owing to certain defects in its government that colony has fallen into a state of financial embarassment requiring immediate relief. Lord John Russell traced the history of the settlement from its foundation and stated that while its revenue does not exceed t20000 its expenditure has increased to the enormous sum of t130000 a year ! At present its affairs are managed by commissioners the responsible Ministers of the Crown having no direct control over its expenditure. This is manifestly an evil and must form the subject of future legislation but in the meantime it is necessary to provide for the payment of certain bills now over-due. Accordingly Lord John Russell proposed that her Majesty should be authorized to guarantee a loan of t210000 for this purpose. Lord Stanley concurred generally in the views of the noble Secretary for the Colonies but though that the Government ought not to demand a loan until they had brought in a bill to explain distinctly the principles on which they proposed that the colony should henceforth be governed. Sir Robert Peel suggested that the Government should ask a vote of credit for the sum required which as it met the urgency of the case was ultimately agreed upon and the subject was deferred till Friday.  ID298,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1841,03,31,inform,New South Wales Mr Grote rose to move a series of resolutions in con demnation of the application of a part of the Land and Emigration Fund of New South Wales to the maintenance of gaols and police in that colony. It was in 1831 that this expense antecedently borne by the Home Government was for the first time thrown upon the colony whose revenues were then found to yield considerable surplus of revenue beyond expenditure. The charge so imposed at that time was calculated to be about t25000 a year ; and had that been all the colony would have borne it without a murmur; but in fact it had ever since averaged nearly t60000. It was not reasonable to impose such a charge on the colony on account of gaols and police constituted not the ordinary uses of a colonial society but for the peculiar purposes of our transportation system. The argument urged by the Home Government was that the expense was chiefly caused by the extensive distribution of convicts by assignment throughout the colony whose settlers drew a proportional profit from the labour so assigned. But that assignment was a gain not more to the colonists who obtained the labour than to the mother country which saved the expense of maintaing the labourers. Whatever value the mother country might be entitled to claim for the labour of the convicts ought in strictness to fall not on the colony at large but on the individual employers; and if there were valid reasons against an exaction of premium from them still it was unjust to throw the obligation upon the colony at large. That was to pay private wages out of public rates. This one charge on the oclony was sufficient on account for all that embarassment in its finances which had been growing for the last six years. It had been enabled to defray the impact only by resorting to the emigration fund and thus checking emigration itself. No less than t260000 had been abstracted from that fund to meet these costs of jails and police. The diversion of that fund from emigration was a great evil both to the colony where labour is so pressingly needed and to the poor of this country to whom that refuge is so material. He considered the emigration fund as held by the Government in trust for the united intersts of the colony and of the mother country. The great extent of sales of land in the colony had been [?] owing to the belief of the colonists that the proceed[?] would be applied to emigration. The hon. member was proceeding to cite the opinions of various persons in favour of this strict application when a motion was made to count the House and it adjourned for want of its quorum[?] of 40 members.  ID299,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1841,04,14,inform,We have received a copy of a Series of Resolutions passed on the 23d of October 1840 by the Legislative Council of New South Wales on the subject of immigration into colony. The object of these resolutions is to encourage emigration from the mother country by showing the demand for labour in New South Wales and the advantages offered to the immigrant. We have only room for a few of the more important resolutions : Resolved. That there exists throughout the colony an urgent and increasing want of working hands in every branch of industry ; that there is ample employment for emigrants at highly renumerating wages without the interruption in this mild climate experienced in colder countries during the winter months ; and that even during the worst period of the past severe drought no persons able and willing to work found any difficult in procuring advantageous employment. Resolved. That in the opinion of this Council there can be no more advantageous field for the employment of industry than is presented in New South Wales– experience proving that able-bodied sober industrious and careful emigrants may within a few years after their arrival rise form the condition of labourers to be themselves employers of labour; by which process and by the progressive increase of the flocks and herds of the colony a constant demand for additional labourers is created sufficient to remove all apprehension of a dearth of employment for as many as may arise. Resolved. That this Council would particularly instance the large and increasing sums at the credit of the working classes in the Savings Bank of New South Wales as affording gratifying evidence of their prosperous condition the deposits having increased from t24469 the amount on 31st December 1835 to t127000 on 31st August 1840. Resolved. That great additional advantage must accrue to the mother country from the large consumption in this colony of British produce and manufactures the declared value of which from 1826 to 1839 according to the official returns for that period amounted to more than eight millions sterling having progressively increased from t280000 the amount in 1826 to t1251969 in 1839 ; whilst the exports from the colony including the produce of the fisheries increased from t106600 in the former year to t948776 in the latter–the total amount being t6187530 for the whole period. Resolved. That the trade between the mother country and this colony together with the whale fisheries in the adjourning seas also affords a valuable nursery for seamen important in this respect in proportion to the distance from Great Britain and calculated to strengthen and secure her maritime power ; and that this field for the employment of British shipping must increase with the growing prosperity of the colony– considerations which appear to this Council to constitute a strong additional claim on the part of the colony to the fostering care of the British Government.  ID301,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1841,09,22,inform,New Zealand Company A very lively and interesting scene occurred on Friday off the West India Dock entrance at Blackwall by the preparation for departure of three fine vessels with improvers for Nelson the second colony of New Zealand. The Directors of the Company and several hundred persons of rank and wealth met there to bid farewell to the enterprising emigrants who appeared highly delighted with the honour extended to them and in high spirits with the anticipations of the successful result of their mission. After viewing the arrangeents made for the comfort of all on board the Directors returned to the West India Dock Tavern where a sumptuous breakfast was provided in the large room. The Duke of Sussex took the chair and was supported on the right by the Earl of Devon and on the left by Jos. Somes Esq. the Governor of the Com pany.

Some have left the town and others are gone to America or Australia.  ID309,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1841,12,29,inform,Another New Field for Emi gration The Falkland Islands have been nominally a British colony for some years; but in consequence of representations made to Government by various persons interested in the trade to the South Seas a plan has at least been drawn up for establishing a body of settlers in these islands. It was submitted to the late Ministers who referred it to the Commissioners of Emigration and the Lords of the Admiralty by both of whom it was approved. Rules were prepared by the Commissioners of Emigration ; a vote of t3750 was put into the estimates for the first year's expense and we suppose passed. If steps have not been taken already to send out emigrants we presume they will be taken about the beginning of next winter which is their summer. These islands are about 300 miles from the south extremity of the American continent in a latitude corresponding with that of London. Their climate however very closely resembles that of Shetland. They have cold summers and mild winters. Snow seldom lies in them; but owing to their humidity and want of sunshine and the stormy winds which blow almost constantly wheat of barley could not be raised in them and even oats might turn out to be a precarious crop. It is doubted also if wood will grow and at present there is not a single tree in the islands. Turnips and potatoes succeed well and there is an abundance of good grass upon which some thousands of black cattle horses and hogs thrive in the wild state and sheep have been introduced and found to do well. Extensive peatbogs exist which will afford a sufficient supply of fuel. The present population consists of twentyfive persons young and old–one-half of them British the other Gauchos South American Indians of a semi-civilised description. They are all stationed at Port-Louis a fine natural harbour where a British officer resides. The islands are numerous but all very small except two whose area is estimated at 13000 square miles or nearly half the extent of Scotland. They are deeply perforated by arms of the sea and probably afford a greater number of fine natural harbours than any country of equal extent in the world. Their shores afford excellent fish of many kinds and seals are exceedingly numerous. The great object in establishing a colony here is to provide a harbour of refuge and place of refitment for our ships frequenting the South Seas which are yearly increasing in number. Every vessel going to the Pacific Ocean or coming from it passes within sight of these islands or near them. At present 60 or 70 British ships pass these islands annually coming from Chili or Peru and 20 more engaged in the whale fishery. The trade to New South Wales employs 236 vessels most of which return to England by this route which will also be preferred by vessels trading to New Zealand Van Diemen's Land Port Philip and probably South Australia. From Sydney or Hort Town the distance is nearly the same by Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope but the prevalence of westerly winds in the parallel beyond the 30th renders the latter route the more advantageous on the outward voyage and the former on the return. The Falkland Islands are about half as distant from Britain as New South Wales. The Emigration Board recommend that Government should send out two surveyors to select an eligible site for a town and to lay out the land in blocks of half a square mile which may be subdivided. It is proposed to sell the land to emigrants at 12s. per acre and to expend part of the money in carrying out additional settlers part in defraying the colonial outlay. There are 40000 wild cattle in the largest island the privilege of shooting which or catching and taming them might be sold to the settlers or a company. The climate is uninviting but there is little doubt that persons accustomed to grazing or sheep farming or to sealhunting or deep-sea fishery might drive a profitable trade here. A vast number of ships making long voyages American French Dutch as well as British pass the islands and to these it would be a great accommodation to find supplies of provisions and the means of refitting here. Some of our starving population in the North of Scotland or the Islands might better their circumstances by removing to the Falkland Islands.  ID310,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1841,02,17,inform,New Zealand. ( From the Morning Chronicle.. The dinner given on Saturday by the New Zealand Company to Lord John Russell will serve to remove all apprehensions if any are yet entertained with regard to the relations between that colony and the Government of the parent state. Many of the first names in the country honoured this splendid banquet by their presence ; and men of all parties Tories Whigs and Radicals appeared to be actuated only by one common feeling. The public are now tolerably familiar with the natural advantages of New Zealand which appears destined to be in the Souther Ocean what Great Britain is in the Northern. Lord Ashburton with must felicity observed that the position of the New Zealand islands on the map their climate fertility abundant harbours surrounded with the seas most suited to the whale fisheries and above all the character to the native population led him to anticipate that these islands were likely to become the great seat of wealth and naval power. Lord John Russell was justly complimented on all hands for adding these important islands to the great colonial empire of this country. The speech of Lord John Russell was much and deservedly applauded. I believe said his lordship that the foundation of this colony of New Zealand will tend to the honour and dignity of the Crow and will tend to the prosperity and future greatness of the nation (cheers). It was on this ground and for these reasons that I lent my humble efforts in support of those exertions that had been made and were about to be made by the New Zealand Company. Gentlemen in so doing I should be unworthy of your approbation if I took any extraordinary merit to myself ; for in the first place the principle of colonization the value of colonies to this country the means they afford of augmenting her strength of adding to her power of promoting her wealth and of increasing her prosperity– all this has been ascertained and demonstrated by the enlightened discussions of past years (hear hear). With regard to the best mode of colonization likewise we have had the advantage and assistance of the most enlightened opinions and the most adverse discussion I therefore can only take to myself the merit of not being blind to the importance and value of those opinions and discussions (hear and cheers) But though his lordship speaks thus humbly of his own merits in recommending the adoption of these islands by the Crown it was perfectly well understood by all present that for his conduct with respect to his colony he has truly entitled himself to the gratitude of his country. Lord Ashburton only paid him a deserved tribute when he complimented him for the sagacity with which he had appreciated the importance of these islands so soon as he had entered on the administration of colonial affairs and for the judicious measure of setting up the British flag in them. We may observe that the health of her Majesty's Ministers proposed by Mr Hutt M.P. was received with loud and universal cheering and that Mr Labouchere's speech which was a very good one was well received. Upon the whole Lord John's visit to the City on this occasion is calculated to gain the Government favour among the commercial classes. His lordship may well be proud that though New Zealand was formally taken possession of in the name of the Sovereign of this country many years ago it was reserved for him to make it a British colony.  ID312,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1842,05,18,inform,There is something curious in the preference which the emigrants from England Scotland and Ireland display for different localities. The proportions emigrating the countries below are as follows:– Emigrants English Per cent. Scottish Per cent. Irish Per Cent. To United States 54 14 1/2 12 – Sydney 17 21 1/2 7 – Canada 8 1/2 25 50 – Port-Philip 8 14 7 As the table expressly bears to be a return of the persons who have emigrated we can scarcely suppose that it includes persons who went out to the countries mentioned on business without any intention of settling. In the report for Canada the number who went to the United States in 1841 is stated to be only 32500 or about two thirds of what stands in the above table. It will be observed that not a single emigrant to India or Ceylon appears in the table; yet surely some persons go with the express view of remaining in these countries. The number of person who were enabled to emigrate in 1841 by means of bounties payable in the colonies was for New South Wales 22752 for Van Diemen's Land 331. It must be remembered that New South Wales includes PortPhilip. There are returns of land sold but not in a very perfect form. In Canada in the year 1839 1840 and 1841 the lands sold were 176518 acres. The average price was 3s. to 3s. 8d. in Lower and 12s. to 13s. in Upper Canada; the lands granted without sale were 194000 acres exclusive of those for Lower Canada in 1841. In Nova Scotia New Brunswick and Cape Breton about 200000 acres have been sold at prices varying from 2s. 3d. to 3s. 8d. The lands granted are inconsiderable. At the Cape 129000 acres have been sold in the three years at prices from 2s. 5d. to 3s. 3d. Lands sold in New South Wales Acres. Average Price. Sydney District–1839 234272 8s 2 1/2d. 1840 105900 18s. 8 1/2d. 1841 15790 20s. 0 1/2d. Port-Philip–1839 38343 36s. 6 1/2d. 1840 83687 51s. 11 3/4d. (Six months)– 53733 20s. 0d. 531930 The sales were chiefly by auction. In Van Diemen's Land the sales in 1839 1840 were about 130000 acres at 10s. or 11s.; in Western Australia (Swan River) in 1839 1840 1841 the sales were 71000 acres from 6s. 1d. to 11s.; in South Australia 55000 acres at 20s. The sales of land are no bad index of the progress of the colonies in capital and cultivation; and according to this criterion it will be seen that those which were advancing most rapidly in the three years were Sydney and Port-Philip. The money received in payment of land in these two colonies in 1839 and 1840 amounted to t307647; and if we understand the report correctly the whole of this sum is applicable to emigration that is to defraying the expense of carrying out emigrants. The 118592 emigrants probably carried with them or expended on their passage twenty pounds each; and thus the money which left the country must have amounted to upwards of two millions. This gigantic emigration one of the things which convey an idea of the immense resources of Britain. The United Kingdom contains only the ninth part of the population of Europe; and we believe it may be safely said that all the other eight parts do not send out half the number of emigrants annually which are sent by the British Isles alone.  ID313,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1842,02,05,entertain,A ustralian Trust Company Incorporated by Royal Charter No. 48 Moorgate Street London. Capital t100000 in 10000 shares of t100 each with power to increase the capital to t2000000. Directors.

To be joined by Thomas Icely Esq. who was a Director here and who is on his way to Sydney. Solicitor–James Norton Esq. The Company was established and incorporated (and is now in full operation) to carry out in Australia a principle which has been acted on with great success elsewhere namely that of taking up money in this country at a moderate rate of interest on the credit of a large invested capital and laying it out on undoubted freehold security at a higher rate. The Company is now prepared to grant transferable notes under the Corporation seal to persons desirous of advancing Money to the Company on loan. The notes will be for t100 each or any larger sum desired by the lender and will be made payable at any period which may be agreed upon not being shorter than two years. The notes will bear interest at the rate of five per cent per annum payable half-yearly (on the 15th January and 15th July) on the production of the half-yearly vouchers which will be annexed to each note: these vouchers or coupons will render it unnecessary for the holder of a note to present the note itself until the principal becomes due. The form of note has been preferred to that of bond as admitting of transfer without expense or trouble whilst it affords equal security to the holder. The Colonial Board has been established in Sydney and the operation of the Company are at present confined to New South Wales. Security being the first object of the Company all the arrangements have been framed with the view to attain that end. The Loans are made at a fixed interest of 10 per cent although the current rate is much higher. The land mortgaged (exclusive of collateral security) must not be of less value than double the amount of the loan. The non-payment of interest on the day it becomes due subjects the mortgager to 2 1/2 per cent additional interest for the period in arrear; and all parties in default for ten days are to be proceeded against the Solicitor of the Company without further instructions and without distinction or exception of any person whatever. The Colonial Board only draws on the Company as loans are agreed on; their bills must be advertised for public competition and the purchasers pay the amount in exchange for the Bill to the Bank of Australasia (the Capital of which is t120000) to the credit of the Company to be drawn out by checks of the Colonial Board in favour of the borrowers as the mortgages are completed. The high character of the members of the Colonial Board affords the fullest assurance that these arrangements will be strictly adhered to in spirit as well as in form; no difficulty has been experienced in investing the full monthly amount sanctioned by the instructions of the Court of Directors: indeed the Chairman of the Colonial Board states that he does not entertain the smallest doubt of a safe investment of all the funds which may be placed at the disposal of the Colonial Board. The high rate of interest in Australia has attracted much private capital from this country to be invested in mortgages. These investments have been made through the agency of individuals or mercantile firms and therefore subject to contingencies from which the Company is exempt. To those who may desire to make such investments it must be obvois that the stock of the Company presents a much superior security and the prospect of a greatly increased return inasmuch as the Company derives a large profit by lending at 10 per cent in Australia the money borrowed here at half that rate. It is equally clear that those who merely seek temporary employment for their money without becoming shareholders cannot have a better security than the Promissory Notes of the Company for the due payment of which the whole capital of the Company as well as the mortgages on which the money is laid out stand pledged. Every shareholder is required to execute in a Deed of Covenant by which he becomes bound to pay to the full amount of his shares and the Charter supplies Creditors with the utmost facility in enforcing demands against the Company. When it is considered that the funds of the Company here are kept in Government Securities and no money lent in Australia except on the best mortgages on land with collateral security in addition it may be fairly asserted that in many respects the Promissory Notes are entitled to a decided preference over mortgages in this country which generally bear one per cent. less interest than that paid by the Company. The Charter provides that the sums borrowed shall not exceed four times the amount of capital paid up. That the whole capital of the Company and all the mortgages on which their money is lent in Australia shall constitute a security to the lenders of money to the Company. That the mortgages are to be on land with the power of taking collateral security on stock &c. That every mortgage shall be registered–the register to contain such particulars as the Governor of the colony may deem necessary. That a copy of the register of the mortgages shall be kept at the office of the Company in London for the information of the share-holders and lenders. That an annual report be made to the Lords of the Treasury of all sums borrowed by the Company and of the appropriation of them. John Innes Managing Director.

The representations which have been very forcibly urged by the American Minister Mr. Pinckney include various topics of complaint. Amongst these are the withholding of the poste of Niagara Detroit &c. in violation of the treaty of 1783; the exciting of the Creek and other Indians to make war upon the American frontier; the refusal to make compensation for the property seized by the armies under Lord Cornwallis &c in the Southern States according to stipulation; the seizure of American ships bound to France; the impressing of American citizens to man our fleets; and finally the sullen silence which the British Minister is alledged to have uniformly maintained on the subject of the claims made by the Republic. The American Minister has however so little hope of efficacy from these representations that he has ordered in his tradesman's bills and made every other preparation for an abrupt departure. Notwithstanding this a??miny aspect of affairs we still must hope that no consequences subversive of the pacific system at present subsisting between America and Great Britain will ensue; for illjudged and ignorant indeed of the true interests of his country must that Briton be (whatever his rank( who would advise another American war –a war which reasoning of the future by the sorrowful experience of the past can only serve to increase the sum and to swell the catalogue of human woe.
