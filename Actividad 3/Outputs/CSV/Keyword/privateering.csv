This was at Chippawa Creek.– The enemy then fled with the utmost precipitation to Fort Erie and began the destruction of his fortifications. A military courier from Kingston arrived this morning brings no additional news of importance.– Sir James Yeo had returned to Kingston with the sick of the army of Niagara on board. We again sailed for the head of the Lake. A private letter from Niagara of the 10th instant says that a severe action took place the day before near Chippawa ; our loss is stated at 10 killed and wounded. That of the enemy is supposed to be very considerable ; a field piece made to bear upon one of his columns did great execution. Another letter denies any loss in killed but makes the wounded 25 or 30. Montreal Nov. 5. From Upper Canada we have received nothing of importance. The report of the whole American armies have crossed the Niagara was a mistake as the last accounts from that quarter mention that General Brown was still in possession of Fort Erie. Quebec Nov. 3. We are in expectation of some further details of the operations on the Niagara frontier by this day's Montreal post ; but they had no arrived at one o'clock. The evacuation by the enemy of our territory on that frontier is a striking illustration of the importance of the command of the lake. The enemy did cross over to our side till the moment his fleet was ready to assume the superiority. The re-appearance of our fleet effected what could not be done by the expence of so much blood and treasure. (From the Quebec Gazette) The American Government has published the pa pers relating to the late negotations at Ghent. We confess that we have seen these papers with feelings of some satisfaction and much regret ; satisfaction that we can now say that the honour of the British Government is pledged to do something for British interests in North American and regret that that something is so little. The Indians are to be made independent of both nations. This is perfectly just and would under certain cirumstances greatly add to the security of these provinces. The Lakes are to be exclusively British. On these subjects we must be permitted to ask how long they would be permitted to remain so how long the Indians would retain their independence in the event of another war if the communication with them should be in the power of the enemy ? The sole communication for military purposes with the Indians and the Lakes is by the river St Lawrence from Montreal to Kingston and from Niagara to Fort Erie ; and the Americans are to be permitted to remain in possession of one of its banks ! The enemy has hitherto been prevented from interrupting this communication by the thinness of the settlements of their side the consequent badness of the roads and difficulty of supplying a large force. The possession of th southern bank of the St Lawrence between Montreal and Kingson and the power of supplying themselves and operating on that frontier by the roads now existing and from Lake Champlain has been worth a large force to them during the whole of the war ; it has caused us to parcel our force to support the line of communication between Lake St Francis and Kingston and keep a great proportion of it to protect the base of that line in the vicinity of Montreal. The position of Canada relative to the United States with its present boundaries is an extraordinary one ; so much so that intelligent military men have pronounced it incapable of defence much beyond Quebec. The miserable state of the enemy's preparations the superiority which we then had on the Lakes the good disposition of the inhabitants and the prudent conduct of the commander of the forces alone saved it. The waste of means in protecting and conveying supplies by a communication of five hundred miles adjoining the whole way to the enemy's frontie is conceivable only to those whom experience has made acquainted with the fact or who are habituated to reflection ; and whenever the communication of the Lakes becomes interrupted the supply of any force further advanced on the line becomes utterly impracticable. The enemy derives his supplies either by the Lakes upon which an army can effect nothing or from a settled country a long way in his rear protected by his army a country covered with woods and a militia more effective than the best troops in such a country always ready for the protection of their property and their houses– Under such circumstances the weakness of an army beyond a certain point is to be counted by its numbers. We scruple not to say that whenever that part of the State of New York extending to the St Lawrence between Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain shall be fully settled the whole of Upper Canada must fall to the United States the Lower Canada will not be defensible but at an expence of means far beyond its value. We had much rather see the Americans confirmed in the possession of Sackett's Harbour Presqu-ile Detroit and Michilimackinac than in the possession of the tract of country just mentioned. Great Britain will always have the means of establishing a superiority on the Lakes whenever she chuses to exert them but she never will be able to drive the Americans out of that frontier when once fully settled supported as they will be by the immense population of the back parts of the State of New York and adjoining States. From the United States Papers Urbanna Sept. 25. An express has arrived from Detroit to General M'Arthur in six days in which Governor Cass says– A state of things has arrived in which your presence with the force at your disposal is essential to the security and preservation of the country. The Indians have recommenced hostilities on every side of us ; they are murdering the people and breaking up the settlements. There is now a large force of them in the immediate vicinity of this place most probably within a mile of it with the avowed purpose of attacking the town. We have no force adequate to the defence of the country and none of description proper for the pursuit of the Indians– My opinion is that you should hasten on with the mounted men with all possible expedition. The express came by water the land communiation being entirely cut off. Albany Oct. 25. The Legislature of this State adjourned yesterday after a session of four weeks. The principal laws passed are: An act to authorise the raising of troops for the defence of this State. An act to encourage privateering. An act to authorise the raising of a corps of sea fencibles. An act to provide for the repayment of certain sums of money advanced by the Corporation of the city of New York for the defence of the State and for other purposes. An act to prevent the apprehension of British deserters. An act to authorise the raising of two regiments of men of colour. An act authorising additional pay to be made to the volunteers and for paying the militia called into service by the State authority. An act to aid in the apprehension of deserters from the army and navy of the United States. The first act authorises the Governor to call into actual service 12000 men for the term of two years provided the Government of the United States shall have declared their intention to pay clothe and subsist them at their expence. The privateer bill authorises associations to incorporate themselves for the purpose of fitting out privateers. The following resolution introduced by Mr Monell passed both Houses of our Legislature unanimously on Saturday:– Resolved unanimously–That the House of Assembly of the State of New York view with mingled emotions of surprise and indignation the extravagant and disgraceful terms proposed by the British Commissioners at Ghent–that however ardently they may desire the restoration of peace to their country they can never consent to receive it at the sacrifice of national honour and dignity–that they therefore strongly recommend to the National Legislature the adoption of the vigorous and efficacious measures in the prosecution of the war as the best means of the bringing the contest to an honourable termination and of transmitting unimpaired to their posterity their rights liberty and independence. The following is a private letter which was brought by the Liffey : Montreal Nov. 5. 1814. Sir George Prevost reached Kingston on the 10th October where his presence has been of the utmost importance. Chauncey resigned his blockade of that place on the 8th and retired with his squadron to Sackett's Harbour. Our fleet which was ready for the Lake in a few days after Sir George's arrival sailed for Niagara on the 16th with 500 of the 90th and a supply of provisions and stores for the right division and arrived off Fort George on the evening of the 18th. Having landed this reinforce ment Sir James returned to Kingston on the 24th. The enemy at Fort Erie having been joined by General Izard's army making a force of 7 or 8000 men advanced upon General Drummond and attacked our positions upon the Chippawa on the 15th instant ; but having met with an opposition unexpected by them and making no impression retired on the 16th and 17th to Black Creek from whence they advanced one of Izard's brigades 1500 men on the 19th with a view of our turning our right and attempted to cross the Chippawa about six miles from its mouth where they were met with by a corps of about 1000 troops under Colonel Meyers who faced them most manfully ; they skirmished the whole day in which the Glengarries supported their high character and in the evening Jonathan finding himself foiled and unable to bring up his artillery from the horrid state of the roads retired again to the main body at Black Creek. Our casualties on this occasion were triflin– those of the enemy were said to have been considerable though he refrained from exposing himself to our fire in the open ground. We had two field-pieces there and whenever the enemy showed a column out of the wood a well-directed discharge soon obliged them to return to their shelter. By this time our fleet being announced gave alarm to the enemy and they commenced a precipitate retreat to Fort Erie. They were purused on the 20th and 21st by our advance under Major-General Watteville close to Fort Erie where he found them occupying the high ground which General Drummond had not left many weeks before and could push no further. At the date of the last accounts from General Drummond Jonathan still maintained his post from which it will require a few columns of fresh troops to dislodge him but as they are now on their way to join the right dividion I trust I shall in a short time have the pleasure to acquaint you of the complete expulsion of the enemy from the Niagara frontier. It is said that for want of sufficient shelter a part of General Izard's force had crossed to Buffalo and that they had passed over some heavy artillery and stores leaving at the fort such a force as they conceived capable of defending it. Sir James brough down with him the skeleton of the 1st battalion of the King's regiment and the remains of the two flank companies of the 10th. He sailed again on the 1st inst. taking with him about 1200 men comprising the 37th a brigade of artillery a 9pounder and detachments from the 6th and 82d regiments and a large supply of provisions and stores. The five hundred of the 9th regiment who marched to York would be crossed to Niagara in the brigs ; the 9th 850 strong were to have been embarked in the fleet but Sir James could not take them. The Royals 41st 89th and 100th exhausted corps return to Kingston by this trip of the fleet which I fear was scarcely able to make another this season. The St Lawrence has proved a noble ship and one and all seem delighted with her. The frigate in frame arrived at Kingston where she has been laid down and lengthened to make her the size of the Prince Regent. The keel of a 74 is also laid down there. The Americans are said to have commenced upon two more ships of the class of the Superior. Letters from Michilimacinack to the 19th October state that the capture of the two schooners will be attended with the most important benefits in the security of that post and the territory dependent upon it. Captain Rocheblave with the detachment of the 81st under Capt. Wardrop and artillery arrived there on the 14th October without any casualty among the troops ; and Mr M'Kenzie with his brigade would arrive about the 21st. The two schooners had made a trip to Nottawasage for provisions and supplies and would attempt another before the navigation closed. A reinforcement had been sent under Capt Bulgar to Praire du Chain. The arrangements necessary for reinforcing and supplying General Drummond's army being completed and the attack upon Sackett's Harbour being deemed impracticable this season Sir George returned last evening to this place ; his journey to Kingston has certainly had the effect of inducing General Brown with a considerable part of his force to move to Sackett's Harbour and has thus left General Izard so much weakened at Fort Erie that I have little doubt of the result of an attack upon him. I am sorry to see that the malice of a certain party here has been at work at your side of the water ; it has increased tenfold since the expression of the public sentiment in favour of his Excellency by the addresses which are now preparing and which I can assure you is the real and unsolicited voice of the people. I am happy to find that General Kempt is going to England as he will afford true information upon the state of the country and be able to exposethe falsehoods which have been circulated respecting recent events.  ID169,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,07,12,inform,Maritime Intelligence The Jane Drummond of Liverpool arrived at Savannah was plundered on the 22d April in [?] 34 10. long. 41. 21. of all her specie 20500 dollars stores provisions &c. by a Spanish ship of 300 tons armed with 14 guns and two stern chasers and full of men. She was supposed to have been out two or three months from Cuba. She had a yellow waist woman head painted black and was coppered to light water mark. Intelligence from Marseilles dated 22d inst. states –' An English Captain who left Oran on the 13th inst. and arrived yesterday in this port has declared that a squadron of five armed ships which he was assured were destined for the North Seas sailed from Algiers at the beginning of the present month. A vessel the Prompt sailed on Tuesday evening from Greenock for Quebec having on board emigrants from Anderston Rutherglen Lesmahogow and Lanark to the number of about 350 persons. The Rev. Mr Easton of Montreal goes out with the Prompt. The Hibernia M'Eachren from the Clyde to Buenos Ayres was totally lost the 15th April near Maldonado. Crew saved. Discovery of a New Island off Cape Horn A new island has been discovered off Cape Horn in inst. 61 deg. long. 55 deg. by the ship William on a voyage from Monte Video for Valparaiso. The same having been dispatched by Captain Sheriff of the Andromache frigate to survey the coast had explored it for 200 miles. The captain went ashore found it covered with snow and uninhabited. Abundance of seals an whales were found in its neighbourhood. He has named the island New Shetland. Accounts from Constantinople dated May 26 annouce that the armaments against Ali Pacha are upon the most formidable scale and are actively pursued.– The latter has obtained hostages of his principal officers as pledges of their fidelity. On the 14th two new ships of the line were launched in the presence of the Sultan and his Grand Dignitaries at the hour fixed by the chief astrologers. The navigation between Bagdad[?] and Bassurah has been free since the defeat of the Arabs by the English. The latter it is stated have facilitated the intercourse between those two places by the establishment of parket-boats.  ID343,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,06,18,persuade,The American States having now gained their independence have no cause of quarrel let with this country; but matters are very different between them and Spain. It is well known that the Indians on the back settlements have been regularly supplied with arms and ammunition from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies to enable them to distress the Americans and prove at least a hindrance to their growing prosperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi has been denied them?and the Spaniards now in possession of the Floridas have been continually quarrelling with them about their boundaries. It may therefore be considered as almost certain that the American states will take an active part against Spain. This will be a great acquisition to Britain in every point of view; for though American cannot furnish money she can furnish men and provisions; and afree intercourse with her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the security of our West-India Islands. Their privateers too will be able to take their runs so speedily that the Spanish trade must be very materially injured thereby.  ID375,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,07,21,inform,United States June 4 1794. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives Lay before Congress the copy of a letter with its enclosure from the Secretary of State to the Minister Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty; it being an answer to a letter from the Mnister to him; bearing date the 22 ult. and already communicated. GEO. WASHINGTON. Philadelphia June 2 1794. SIR. If the letter with which you honoured me on the 22d ult. had not entered into a train of recrimination against the United States I should not now trouble you with a return to its unpleasant topics. Among the reasons which would have induced me to add nothing to my letter the 1st of lat month its would have been of some weight that by silence I should avoid the repetition of a style and manner which seem to have produced a personal excitement. As you are willing to admit the authenticity of Lord Dorcester's speech we will with your approbation reserve for a future discussion on what occasion and to what degree an explanation may be required by the government of the United States from a foreign minister. I selected only one passage of that speech because in it was concentrated the real object of the whole; which was to declare an expectation that Great Britain would be at War with the united States in the course of the present year. and if she were to cause the warriors to draw a line. this is the undisguised sense of the governor-general unaffected by the preliminary words which you have thought proper to quote. It is your own interpretation. For so far are you from contradicting my assertion that Lord Dorchester fostered and encouraged in the Indians hostile dispositions towards us that you continue the greater part of your remaining observations to vindicate his persuasion and your own that the principal aggression leading to hostility proceeded from the United States and to suggest many others of the same tendency upon which you would not dilate. I shall not shrink Sir from your charges. 1st Notwithstanding the territory upon which certain inhabitants of Vermont are presented in your letter of the 5th of July 1792 to have trespassed belong to the United States; yet on the 9th of the same month did my predecessor give you as is admitted positive assurances of the determination to discourage and repress the subject of your complaint. The necessary instructions were accordingly forwarded to that state. On examining your correspondence with my department it does not appear that from the 9th of July 1792 to the 10th of March 1794 upwards of nineteen months our government ever unrdestood from yourself or any authority ofhis Britannic Majesty that the original dissatisfaction continued. Nor was any discontent heard from that quarter through other channels except what related to outrages upon our own citizens by British subjects. Then indeed thirty days after the hostile tribes of Indians had been assembled by Lord Dorchester at Quebec you renewyour remonstrance. Although it cannot be by any means believed that this was written in order to ausher in the intelligence which soon after arrived on his speech; ye tit is difficult to account for so long an interval under the circumstances supposed. Nor ought my answer although delayed for fifty days until the 19th of April 1794 to be constured into an assent to any charge since at the end of that period having been disappointed as my letter shews in one opportunity of information and no other presenting itself we were not in a capacity of contradicting your assertions. However Sir the instructions issued in consequence of your application conveyed positive orders for the correction of what upon examination should be found irregular. 2d Among the points to which you intimate that you might have adverted is enumerated the fitting out of two privateers at Charleston South Carolina. Whatever this transaction might have been it probably occurred at the commencement of the war and before the existence of the war was communicated to our government by any of the powers engaged. Had such a transaction been known to the President in time you can well judge from his actual conduct what he would then have done. His proclamation on the 2nd of April 1793 his call upon the state governors on the 26th of the same months to co-operate with him in the work of impartiality and peace; the system of rules which he established and which were imparted to you are unerring indications of the spirit of those measures on which he had determined. He suppressed the consular courts which attempted to pass sentences of condemnation on captures; he restored several vessels to British owners; prosecutions have been instituted against the violaters of neutrality. In a word Sir what has been required under the sanction of the law of nations which had not been fulfilled? How many thingshave been spontaneously done to evince our impartiality? Let me request you to review my predecessor’s letters to you of April 22 May 15 June 5 August 7 8 25 September 5 and 12 1793: and to say if more could be well expected from us? After such demonstrations it might have been hoped that the equipment of these two privateers would not rise again in the shape of a charge. But the letter of the 5th of June being conceived of itself to be satisfactory is here inserted. In the letter which I had the honour of writing you on the 15th of May in answer to your several memorials of the 8th of that month I mentioned that the President reserved for further consideration a part of the one which related to the equioment of two privateers in the port of Charleston. The part alluded to was that wherein you express your confidence that the executive government of the United States would pursue measures for represeeing such practices in the future and for restoring to their rightful owners any captures which such privateers might be bring into the ports of the United States. The Presidentafter a full investigation of this subject and the most mature consideration has charged me to communicate to you that the first part of this application is found to be jest and that effectual measures are taken for preventing repetitions of the act therin complained of; but that the latter part desiring restitution of the prizes is understood to be inconsistent with the rules which govern such cafes and would therefore be unjustifiable towards the other party The principal agents in this transaction were French citizens. Being within the United States at the moment a war broke out between their own and another country they determine to go in its defence; they purchase arm and equip a vessel with their own money man it themselves receive a regular commission from their nation depart out of the United states and then commence hostilities by capturing a vessel If under these circumstancethe commission of the captors was valid the property according to the laws of war was by the capture transferred to them; and it would be an aggression on their nation for the United states to rescue it from them whether on the high seas or on coming into their ports. If the commission was not valid and consequently the property not transferred by the laws of war to the capture then the case would have been cognizable in our courts of admiralty and the owners might have gone thither for redress. So that on neither supposition would the executive be justifiable in interposing. With respect to the United States the transaction can in no wise be imputed to them. It was in the first moment of the warߝin one of the their most distant port.ߝbefore measures could be provided by the government to meet all the cases which such a state of things was to produce impossible to have known and therefore impossible to have been prevented by that government. The moment it was known the most energetic orders were sent to every state and port in the union to prevent a repetition of the accident. On a suggestion that citizens of the United States had taken part in the act one who was designated was instantly committed to prison for prosecution; one or two others have been since named and committed in like manner; and should it appear that there were still others no measures would be spared to bring them to justice. The President had even gone farther; He has required as a reparation of their breach of respect to the United States that the vessels so armed and equipped shall depart from our ports. You will see Sir in these proceedings of the President unequivocal proofs of the line of strict right which he means to pursue. The measures now mentioned are taken in justice to the one part; the ulterior measure of seizing and restoring the prizes is declined in justice to the other; and the evil thus early arrested will be of very limited effects; perhaps indeed soon disappear altogether. As to the permission from the governor of South Carolina ??? ??? departures of ??? privateers ??? ??? you may assure yourself of a proper inquiry; and I take the liberty of requesting any evidence which you may have of it 3. With so many direct proofs in your hands of the opinion constantly maintained by our government against the legality of captures in general made by illegal privateers it is not easily explained why the validity of those before the 5th of June 1793 should be argued from a refusal to restore them. The above received letter of that date neither affirms nor disaffirms their validity; but declines the granting of restitutions being inconsistent with the rules which govern such cases. Those ruled are That if the commission be good the capture is good; if the commission be bad the capture is bad; but whether it be good or bad is not decided; it being enough to prove that the transaction for the reasons assigned can in no wise be imputed to the united States. But if captures of this kind prior to the 5th of June 1792 do really amount (as is conceived by some) to no very considerable value this would of itself lessen the importance of the insinuation. 4th. The secretary of war has undertaken to ascertain the precise state of the privateers le Petit Democrate and la Carmagnole and the result will be communicated to you. In the mean time it is a matter of some surprise that vessels whose single employment and profit must consist in cruizing on the ocean should have remained in the port of New-York during the whole winter and probably up to the date of your letter (May 22d 1794) May it not be presumed that their activity has been checked by the intervention of the government? But sir if they have not been dismantled your letter brings the first notice of the omission. 5th. It is true that the sale of prizes made by French cruizers has not been prohibited in the United States and that our treaty with France has been so interpreted as not to contemplate a freedom to sell. The next resort was to the law of nations; which was scrupulously searched by the executive with the pure desire of discovering truth and justice to all. Upon this as on many other occasions the civilians differ; Vattel declaring That a privateer may carry his prize into a neutral port and there freely sell it; Martens affirming the same doctrine if it has not been otherwise regulated by treaty; and others opposing it. in this sxhism among the writersit was resolved by the President of the United States to impose no restraint upon those sales; and to refer them; as affairs of legislation to congress at the earliest moment of their session. Thus much has been observed not as my final anser but merely to introduce an assurance that I will follow you in the main discussion whensoever you shall bring it forward in detail. 6th. Undoubtedly sir you have been misinformed that the vessels of France have been permitted to depart from our ports notwithstanding the embargo. As the history of the executive proceedings is neither long nor entangled it shall be frankly stated to you. As soon as the embargo was laid expresses and advice boats were dispatched to notify the officer of the customs and revenue cutters and all others concerned in its execution. The resolution imposing it involved all foreign nations; the instructions from the United States favoured no nation directly or indirectly. A French snow La Camille which had descended the river Delaware as low as New-Castle on her voyage was stopped by an officer of the United States; and the President adhering to perfect impartiality could not think himself justified to gratify the Minister of the French Republic with a passport. Passports being kept under the special view of the President were issued only after his examinatino of each case and the total number of them does not exceed twenty-six. Among them was one to yourself; one to an agent who was sent to the West-Indies upon a business connected with the late captures and condemnation in various British courts of admiralty; one to a citizen whose vessel was under trial in Bermuda and who was anxious to forward the British instructions of the 8th January 1794 with a hope of rescuing her from confiscation; one to the friends of Joshua Barney then in Jamica; twenty for the accomodation of several unfortunate inhabitants of St. Domingo to some of whome our government was advancing money for their support and who could no longer endure their separation from home; one to some other persons in peculiar circumstances desirous of returning to the West-Indies; and in the last instance one to the Minister of the French Republic. If therefore by any other passport or permission; the embargo has been relaxed it was unauthorized by the President and unlawful. The distance of Hampton Road from this city being more than three hundred miles the officers of government resident here could not learn at the moment what was passing there. No intelligence of an official nature of any real importance. No complaint from any other foreign minister or any othe rpseron has since reached us. If Sir you should happen to possess the information I ask it as a favour of you to designate who granted the permission and under what circumstances the French vessels left that road? An investigation however has been and shall be pursued on our part without delay. If the law has been violated it shall be vindicated; but a violation of law is very remote from a permission of the government. 7th. The uniformly unfriendly treatment which the British officers are said to have experienced in the United States cannot be answered until it shall be more explicitly defined. Did this treatment break forth in words or actions not cognizable by law? If so no complaint can be offered to government. Or in words or action which were so cognizable? Our courts are free to foreigners against citizens and independent of influence. To yourself let me appeal that on the representations which you thought proper to lay before the President in relation to the British consul at Baltimore the British consul at Norfolk and the commander of the DȰdalus frigate the necessary measures were promptly adopted; the result has been transmitted to you and no objection has been returned. Nor was the government backward in its interference in the late affair of Philadelphia. And these eing the only occurrences of the kind within my knowledge i trust that no example can be produced of government refusing to extend its protection on every seasonable occasion. 8th. The events at Newport in Rhode-Island are accurately detailed in the proceedings which I have the honour of enclosing to you. Within the limits of the present letter I cannot do more; as it might be an useless talk to detain you with remarks when non of them might be adapted to the animadversions which you mediate. It is enough therefore for me to engage that these animadversions whenever they shall appear shall receive particular attention. Although Sir your charges against the United States are sketched only; the impression which may have been intended cannot be counteracted too soon by such general elucidations as at a future day may be more minutely unfolded. But let these facts be as they will; are they indicative of a hostile disposition in the United States and ought they ultimately to produce a state of war? This is not the place for us to retort our complaints. But compare them with the whole of your catalogue; and say what may our feeling be? Yet we prefer peace. 9th. As Lord Dorchester's endeavour to stir up the Indians against us is without justification; so is the expedition of Governor Simcoe without pretext. That you have received no intelligence of such an event having actually occurred leaves room to conjecture that you may not be without intelligence of it having been designed; and that it has therefore probably taken place. But you insist that much will depend on the place intended for the fort. Let the point allotted for it on the Miami be unknown; the place is for our immediate purpose adequatley market out by eing on the river. A single glance of the eye over the map proves that its source is within the limits of the United States. In its whole length it is flanked on each side by our territory. Its very mouth is to the Southward of our line as recognised by our treaty with his Britannic Majesty. On no part therefore of the rapids can a fort be built but within out country. This being fixed your argument is that if the fort be for the purpose of protecting subjects of his majesty residing in districts dependent on the fort of Detroit or of preventing that fortress from being straitened by the approach of the American army; the principle of statu quo until the final arrangement of the point in discussion between the two countries shall be concluded will strictly apply. To change by hostile movements the condition of a thing concerning which a treaty is opened not being consonant with the spirit of adjustment the principle of statu quo has been generally adopted. The nearest point of the rapids to Detroit cannot be less than fifty miles. They have never been considered they never could be considered as appending to Detroit. But you proceed and say tha tthe proposed assumption of territory may depend on districts which depend on Detroit. It is too obvious to dwell upon the remark that if Detroit which lies within the United States becomes the first station from which a district may be generated one encroachment may beget another ad infinitum. It will however be very acceptable to understand with accuracy how much of our territory towards the Miami was actually possessed by the military establishment of Detroit at the time of peace. I mention the military establishment; because if any subjects of his Britainnic majesty reside beyond the line of actual possess they are as being within our limits under our jurisdiction. To prevent the fortress of Detroit from being straitened by the approach of the American army is either a new modification of the preceding idea or founded upon a untenable suspicion. For the question must recur are the rapids an appendage to Detroit? Were they connected with it at the peace? If convenience only were to be consulted and a wide range of unsettled territory by being suitable to the momentary circumstances of one nation is to be transferred for that reason alone from another which is the true proprietor we might even then controvert the conveniency of the rapids to Detroit. If right be consulted our right is complete. Is then our territory to be thus seized? Nay more sir I am authorized to say to you explicitly that the American army has no instructions to straiten or annoy that post; and that if the descent on the rapids was dictated by this consideration it ought to be discontinued without cause. I have the honour Sir to be with great respect Your most obedient servant EDM. RANDOLPH. Mr. Hammond Minister Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty. True Copy. GEO. TAYLOR jun.
