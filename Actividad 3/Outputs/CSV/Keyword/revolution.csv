The American Revolution originated in Adams a very insignificant Bostonian. Not that this Adams had the least expectation of American independence when he fomented the opposition to the stamp-act; indeed no human wisdom could possibly have foreseen the subsequent folly and imprudence of the British administration and its obsequious Parliament. An Administration so totally destitute of common sense so totally ignorant of every princple of sound policy no nation ever beheld. Adams had the sagacity to avail himself of such despicable policies.–Fortunately for the American cause the Generals that were sent from England were of congenial abilities with the Minister and the Americans themselves were surprised at the facility with which they acquired their independence. –Yet all the blunders of the British administration and the miserable conduct of the British Generals would hardly have been sufficient to emancipate America notwithstanding her extreme weakeness without the assistance of France; and this assistance depended entirely on Dr. Franklin being driven to Paris by the fatal-philippic of a certain great lawyer. Such therefore is the chain of concurrent circumstances that hath overturned the French monarch. If the British minister had possessed common sagacity–if he could have distinguished a general from a corporal; if Franklin had been treated with common civility America would have remained a British colony and France an absolute monarch for ages yet to come.  ID45,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,inform,Martinique Oct. 6. The disturbances in this island are so far from having abated that they seem daily to gain additional force. The French General after the and endeavoured to bring over a part of the military to his side against the people : He began with subalterns several of whom took a certain oath of attachment which he administered to them ; but when he came to the Major that officer declined saying he had already engaged himself on the side of the people. Incensed at this reply he reviled him in very opprobrious terms and at last laid his cane upon him ! Frustrated in his attempts upon the infantry he made his next application to the regiment of artillery but with as little success. They informed him that themselves and Culverins were stationed there for the protection of the people and for them only should be used. Driven to the last shift his distress suggested the sorry expedient of having recourse to the people of colour who here form a considerable corps. By a small dose of flattery these people so readily to be caught by a little seeming attention promised to stand by him ; and did so as long as they usually stand firm to any thing–that is till their fears for their own persons became an object of more weighty concern–they then abandoned him. The humiliating familiarities to which he descended to this motley rabble were truly disgusting. He embraced them; called them his enfans and cher amis and practised all the dirty condescensions which those only who are conversant in the praise-worthy art of cajoling can form any conception of. The effect of this conduct was as might be expected insolence–one of this banditti presumed to strike a grenadier–this incensed both the military and the peopl–the consequence was their doughty leader was laid hold of when his trusty defenders left him to his fate. He wa sput into confinement and had the pleasure of beholding from the windows of his prison him whom he had inspired with the insolent temerity to strike White suspended on a gibbet. The inhabitants of St. Pierre then assembled to confer on the measures to be taken on this occasion when ten deputies were chosen to bring the deposed Commander to that part of the island for trial and twelve Judges were chosen to preside at that very important tribunal. Thus stood matters on Thursday last at which time a rumour prevailed that the Marquis de Bouillee had suffered death by the extraordinary and ingenious method of being put between two planks and severed in pieces by a cross-cut saw.  ID49,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,21,inform,Letters from Jamaica say that by vessels arrived there from Hispaniola there are advices that the French inhabitants of that island feel with unabating energy the glorious cause in which their patriotic countrymen in Old France are embarked. Men of every class and description wear the national cockade of blue and white. Their accounts from France similar in date and substance to ours have filled them with the most lively hopes and animated them with a spirit of resistance to the measures of their Government as forcible as it was unexpected by those entrusted with the executive power. At Port au Prince both the Governor and Intendant have rendered themselves completely odious by vain attempts to counteract an impulse that is irresistible. The effigy of Mons. Marbois the latter has been hung and burnt; the people loudly insist that both shall immediately quit the colony and their departure is hourly expected. The press hitherto under the severest restraint triumphs in its freedom; and their weekly publications give an account of the proceedings of the States General without the smallest reserve.
