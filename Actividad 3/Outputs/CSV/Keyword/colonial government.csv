His Grace died at Spanish Town July 4th 1736 in the 45th year of his age. The death of these two Noblemen in their government gave so bad an impression of the climate of Jamaica and the insalubrity of its air that few persons of rank and fortune have been ambitious of becoming governors of it notwith standing the brilliancy of the appointments an nexd to the situation.  ID65,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,07,12,entertain,By the last letters from India we understand they were going on in the plodding way with nothing new or important.–The markets are overstocked with British goods so as to enable our countrymen to supply themselves with most articles at a cheaper rate than if they were at home ; the credit of the revenue rather upon the increase ; Lord Cornwallis is as strict as ever who is expected to remain another year among them to the no small regret of those who left England for the sake of Oriental wealth. Our female adventurers have also found it a bad market ; British beauty never fails of finding its admirers ; but the late restriction in the East have rendered wives forbidden fruit of which neither civil nor military dare to think of tasting.  ID99,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,02,10,inform,The whole expenditure of the American States on all establishments civil and military did not amount in the last year to 180000l.  ID103,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1810,06,09,inform,Canada Extract of a letter from a Gentleman to his Friend in Glasgow Quebec March 23 1810.–A number of leading characters among the Canadians who were Members of the House of Assembly (twice dissolved for improper conduct) and the proprietor of a French paper called La Canadien have been arrested and thrown into jail upon a charge of treasonable and seditious practises ; the printing press types &c. also taken possession of. This vigorous measure of Sir James Craig has astonished the Canadians not a little but the consequences will be no doubt beneficial to the country as it has crushed a faction which has for some years been gaining strength and acquiring dangerous influence over the minds of the inhabitants who are without education and ignorant of course in the extreme ; therefore easily misled by demagogues among their countrymen who seize every opportunity of stirring up all those prejudices which the people of this country naturally have against the British : for having been allowed to preserve their language they are nearly as much Frenchmen now as they were at the conquest. Quebec March 22.–On Sunday afternoon the printer of the Canadien Mr Charles Lafrancois was arrested and committed to jail under a warrant from the Executive Council on a charge of treasonable practises. On Monday evening Dr Blanchet and Mr Bedard and last evening Mr T. Taschereau were also arrested and committed by the same authority on the same charges. The Commander in Chief in Scotland gave an elegant dinner at head-quarters on the 4th curt. to celebrate the King's birthday-day–at which several of the Nobility and Gentry Generals and Field-Officers of the army were present. Among the other accidents that occurred on the King's birth-day from the imprudent use of gunpowder is the death of girl in Richmond Street.– Her clothes were set fire by a squib and although immediately taken to the Infirmary was so severely burnt that she died before morning. A very melancholy accident happened at a place called the Pease Berwickshire. As one of the baggage carts of the Forfarshire militia was stopping there a fine boy about eight years of age belonging to Serjeant-Major Nicol got out of the cart and was climbing on the wheel when the horses suddengoing off threw him on the ground and the wheel passing over his body crushed him to death. The unfortunate mother was upon the cart when this unhappy accident happened. On Thursday night a spirit shop in Gibson-street Glasgow was broken into and about five pounds in silver a seven shilling piece about eight shillings of copper a counterfeit half-guinea and a pocket-book containing some bills and papers carried ; some partial payments are marked on the bills. The villains appear to have entered the shop by forcing up the window shutter with an iron bar and then breaking a pane of glass by which they got the iron bolts and the window opened. On Saturday last a porter was killed in the hold of a vessel in Dundee harbour. He was engaged unloading coals ; and the rope by which the iron pully was supported giving way the measure fell down upon him and killed him instantly. A few days ago a mason of the name of Stevenson was killed by the blowing up of some stones at Templeton in the parish of Auchterhouse. The match unfortunately communicated too early to the powder and the explosion took place before he could get out of the way. He has left a wife and two children to lament his loss.  ID105,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,10,03,inform,Upper Canada York July 28. Yesterday at an early hour his Honour Isaac Brock Esq. administering the Government of Upper Canada and Major-General commanding his Majesty's forces therein arrived at this place from Fort-George and accompanied by a numerous suite proceeded to the Government Building at four p.m. when he opened the present extra session of the Legislature and delivered the following speech to both houses :– Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislature Council and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly The urgency of the present crisis is the only consideration which would have induced me to call you together at a time when public as well as private duties elsewhere demand your care and attention. But Gentlemen when invaded by an enemy whose avowed object is the entire conquest of this province the voice of loyalty as well as of interest calls aloud to every person in the sphere in which he is placed to defend his country. Our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it ; they have evinced by the promptitude and loyalty of their conduct that they are worthy of the King whom they serve and of the constitution which they enjoy ; and it affords me particular satisfaction that while I address you as Legislators I speak to mean who in the day of danger will be ready to assist not only with their counsels but with their arms. We look Gentlemen to our militia as well as to the regular forces for our protection ; but I should be wanting to that important trust committed to my care if I attempted to conceal (what experience the great instructor of mankind especially of legislators has discovered) that amendment in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient. It is for you to consider what further improvements they still may require. Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly From the history and experience of our mother country we learn that in times of actual invasion or internal commotion the ordinary course of criminal laws has been found in adequate to secure his Majesty's Government from private treachery as well as from open disaffection ; and that at such times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws restraining for a limited period the liberty of individuals in many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the particulars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion of the province might justify me in the exercise of the full power reposed in me on such an emergency yet it will be more agreeable to me to receive the sanction of the Houses. A few traitors have already joined the enemy–have been suffered to come into the country with impunity–and have been harboured and concealed in the interior ; yet the general spirit of loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of this province is such as to authorise a just expectation that their efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing– The disaffected I am convinced are few–To protect and defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations is an object worthy of your most serious deliberations. The speech concludes with a call for supplies. Proclamation The unprovoked declaration of war by the United States of America against the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and its dependencies has been followed by the actual invasion of this province in a remote frontier of the western districts by a detachment of the United States. The officer commanding that detachment has thought proper to invite his Majesty's subjects not merely to a quiet and unresisting submission but insults them with a call to seek voluntarily the protection of his Government. Without condescending to repeat the illiberal epithets bestowed in this appeal of the American Commander to the people of Upper Canada on the administration of his Majesty every inhabitant of the province is desired to seek the confutation of such indecent slander in the review of his own particular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian subject who can truly affirm to himself that he has been injured by the Government in his person his property or his liberty? Where is to be found in any part of the world a growth so paid in prosperity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled not thirty years by a band of veterans exiled from their former possessions on account of their loyalty not a descendant of these brave people it to be found who under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment superior to what were possessed by their ancestors. This unequalled prosperity would not have been attained by the utmost liberality of the Government or the persevering industry of the people had not the maritime power of the mother country secured to its colonists a safe access to every market where the produce of their labour was in request. The unavoidable and immediate consequence of a separation from Great Britain must be the loss of this inestimable advantage and what is offered to you in exchange? To become a territory of the United States and share with them that exclusion from the ocean which the policy of their Government enforces ; you are not even flattered with a participation of their boasted independence ; and it is but too obvious that once exchanged from the powerful protection of the United Kingdom you must be re-annexed to the dominion of France from which the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms of Great Britain at vast expence of blood and treasure from no other motive than to relieve her ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire of France was the stipulated reward for the aid afforded to the revolted colonies now the United States ; the debt is still due and there can be no doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consideration for commercial advantages or rather for an expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over the commercial world. Are you prepared inhabitants of Canada to become willing subjects or rather slaves to the despot who rules the nation of Europe with a rod of iron? If not arise in a body exert your energies co-operate cordially with the King's regular forces to repel the invader and do not give cause to your children when groaning under the oppression of a foreign master to reproach you with having too easily parted with the richest inheritance of this earth–a participation in the name character and freedom of Britain. [The proclamation concludes with a declaration that should the Americans refused quarter in consequence of Indians being found in Canadian ranks that a severe and rigorous retaliation will take place.] Isaac Brock Major-Gen. and President Head-quarters Fort George July 22 1812.  ID106,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,10,03,inform,Quebec Papers Provincial Parliament of Lower Canada Legislative Council –Aug 1. This day at two o'clock his Excellency the Governor in Chief went in the usual state to the Legislative Council Chamber and being seated on the Throne the Gentlemen Usher of the Black Rod was sent to command the presence of the Assembly which being come up the Honourable Speaker of the Assembly said– May it please your Excellency His Majesty's faithful subjects the representatives of the province of Lower Canada have passed a bill intituled An Act of facilitate the Circulation of Army Bills. Their loyalty and the happiness of this province in being connected with and powerfully protected by the British nation are the basis of their constitution and the just grounds which gave rise to the formation of the militia and the firm determination to defend this country against the unexpected and unjust war that the United States have lately declared ; they are therefore under the greatest obligation to your Excellency for having communicated to them your wise precautions on the means to ameliorate and insure for several years the punctual payment of the army by circulating bills the reimbursement of which is guaranteed in England. To give them greater credit the bill limits the sums necessary and moreover provides for the interest the advantages accruing therefrom and even for the payment of the principal in specie in this province which has become expressly bound for the same at a fixed period to any person whatever who from the state of his private affairs would prefer such payment. In full confidence that under the present and any unforeseen circumstance your Excellency is invested with all necessary authority the representatives of the province and their constituents rely on the wisdom already experienced of your administration and in the name of the Commons of Lower Canada I have the honour to present this bill to your Excellency humbly requesting thereto his Majesty's assent. His Excellency was pleased to signify the Royal assent. His Excellency then addressed both Houses and the Provincial Parliament was prorogued to the 16th of September.  ID112,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1814,05,26,inform,A proclamation issued by Governor Macquarrie appears in the Sidney Gazette of 14th May stating that Peter Mills Acting Deputy Surveyor of Lands at Port Dalrymple Van Dieman's Land and George Williams Acting Deputy Commissary of Stores and provisions at the said settlement had absconded from their habitations and fled to the woods ; that their object was to live by rapine and violence ; to effect which they had armed themselves and taken the command of a gang of 26 desperadoes with whose aid they had committed numerous robberies–entering the lands of settlers driving away their cattle and plundering their houses. The proclamation declares that those who shall return to their houses and occupations before 1st December next shall be pardoned and saved harmless from all offences except the crime of wilful murder ; and denounces those who shall disregard this offer as outlaws. Sydney New South Wales Jan. 4. The Argo has arrived with a most extensive supply of tea viz 167 chests of souchong 200 ditto bobea 200 hyson skin and young hyson 50 ; in all 617 chests. The consequences has been a reduction in the price of souching from 30s to 5s per lb currency. Shortly prior to the Argo's departure from the Island of Mauritius the Hope American ship laden with tea and sundies valued at L80000 was captured by his Majesty's sloop Harpy Captain Allen. In consequences of the oppressive conduct of several masters of colonial and British ships and of their crews towards the natives of New Zealand of Otaheite and of the other islands in the South Pacific Ocean which have led to the destruction of several vessels with their crews by the natives and disturbed all trade and intercourse with those islands both by British shipping and that ofthe allied powers–his Excellency has forbidden any vessel to clear out from any place in New South Wales without a bond given by the master or owner to the naval officer for the time being at the port for L.1000 sterling binding him and his crew not to commit any act of hostility or to be guilty of any trespass or forment any animosities between the natives or take any part in any war that may prevail ; nor forcibly carry away any male or female inhabitants of the islands under penalty of forfeiting the sum specified in the bond. A small party who a short time ago undertook[?] a land passage in a direction towards Broken Bay for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and fertility of the country have discovered an excellent grazing track of 8000acres. In consequence of which one gentlemen Mr Robert Campbell has already sent thither an extensive herd of cattle and this example is likely to be followed by others. Thomas West who came to this colony a convict for life in the ship Earl Cornwall's[?] in 1801 has received from his Excellency a conditional pardon in consideration of his general good conduct and character for sobriety and industry and also in consideration of his having lately erected a water mill for the grinding of grain at Barcorn Glen within two miles of Sydney being the first water mill ever erected in the vicinty of this town. Sydney New South Wales May 21. The good understanding between the natives and our settlers which had been maintained for the last six years has given place to frequent outrages attended with fatal consequences. On Saturday a body of 60 natives commenced plundering the fields of a settler when three privates of the veteran battalion fired upon them and killed a boy. The narushed upon them before they could load again and killed on private Isaac Eustace and compelled the other two to fly. They then plundered the ground of Messrs Milehouse and Butcher. Next day a party of 14 soldiers falling in with them shot a woman and two children–the savages attacked William Baker a stock-keeper of Mr MacArthur killed the man and two women named Sullivan and Herburg. Sydney New South Wales Feb. 12. On Monday last arrived the ship General Hewett Captain Earle from England having a detachment of the 46th regiment commanded by Major Oglivie ; and yesterday arrived the Windham Captain Bligh also from England having on board the head-quarters of the 46th regiment commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Molle who succeeded Lieutenant-Colonel O'Connell as Lieutenant-Governor of the territory and is accompanied by Mrs Molle and family ; also Lieutenant Walters of the navy agent for transports– Of the 300 convicts which the General Hewett received on board 35 died on the passage.  ID123,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,19,inform,Extract of a letter from the agent to at the Cape of Good Hope dated 15th Nov. 1817: – The following most daring instance of piracy was committed in our harbour on the 11th inst. viz.– The Elizabeth White lying at anchor off Robin Island with about 120 tons of oil on board was boarded at about one a. m. by a party of armed deserters from his Majesty's 10th regiment and convicts about 12 in number i. e. five soldiers and seven convicts who after securing the hatches &c. obtained possession of the ship and in the same instant cut the cables loosed the sails and favoured by a strong S. E. wind succeeded in carrying her off at six a.m. The captain and crew having refused to listen to their invitation to join them in their piratical undertaking with the exception of the mate were permitted to leave the ship in the boat which reached Robin Island in safety about four o'clock the same day. By a letter received to-day we learn that the Admiral Gambier Brash laden with Government stores for Ceylon was totally lost on the morning of the 20th of June last having struck on the reef Roan de Nova in the Mozambique Channel ; crew saved. A letter from Halifax dated the 27th Nonember says – Colonel Bouchette Surveyor - General of Lower Canada with Captain Campbell of the 60th regiment and Mr Bouchette jun. arrived here on the 19th inst. The only information I can yet give you is that the exploring survey has been extended from the source of the St Croix river to the river Restigouche in line about 100 miles ; in this short distance both parties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the severest nature. The Americans employed on the same line with our English Commissioners are represented as men of great ability and acting with that spirit of liberality that infuses confidence on each side rendering their arduous task less severe and gloomy than was to have been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this quarter. Our trade continues dull and money scarce. Government bills are 3 per cent advance but expected to be lower in consequence of the Commissary-General having refused to take the provincial notes. Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard –On Friday night about half-past nine o'clock this place was thrown into the greatest consternation by the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard the beating of drums and the firing of the men of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire having broken out in the house belonging to the steam engine erected for carrying on the new works situated in the southern part of the dock - yard near the kilns used for burning cement stone. The most serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and what was more distressing to the feelings of the spectators was its coniguity to the workhouse which from the pressure of the times and want of employment is crowded with many unfortunate individuals. Providence however averted the impending danger and about twelve o'clock we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames subdued with only the loss of the engine-house. No lives it is understood have been lost but one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker of the Northumberland and the officers of that ship Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter and Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary with the military officers and soldiers of the garrison assembled on the first alarm. The latter were under arms the whole time and were of great service in keeping off the spectators. The inhabitants of the twon were at one time under serious apprehensions as the fire was not far from the Fountain tavern and the residence of Mr Miller in High Street. At the former the landlady of the house had but recently lain in and was removed on the first alarm being given. Sir Robert Barlow from Chatham who superintends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle was here yesterday to investiage into the cause which it is suspected arose from carlessness – The damage however has not been so great as was at first expected and which it might have been but for the prompt and effectual assistance that was given – Sheerness January 11  ID124,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,19,inform,New York and other American papers have been received to the 20th December: – In the house of Representatives on the 9th Mr Johnson brought forward a series of resolutions relative to the military establish the principal of which is the following: – That the military peace establishment of the United States shall consist hereafter of eight thousand men including the corps of invalids. Provided that the corps of engineers the General Staff and Ordnance Department shall be retained as at present established. Provided also that no part of the army shall be disbanded in consequence of said reduction but the same shall be effected by permitting vacancies as they occur to remain – That it is expedient to provide by law for an additional national armoury to be located on the western waters. That it is expedient to organise by law a corps of invalids to be composed of one thousand men. The following resolution relative to foreign seamen was also proposed and adopted without opposition : Resolved. That the Committee of Commerce and Manufactures be instructed to inquire into the expediency of providing by law for the apprehending and securing foreign seamen deserting from foreign vessels while in the ports of the United States contrary to their engagements to serve on board such vessels.  ID127,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,07,16,inform,Canada Papers from Upper Canada contain the draft of a petition to the Prince Regent founded on the resolutions adopted in the province of Niagara where some discontent has been manifested. The first part is as follows:– To his Royal Highness George Prince of Wales Regent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland &c. the humble Address of the Inhabitants of Upper Canada May it please your Royal Highness The subjects of your Royal Father dwelling in Upper Canada should need no words to give assurance of their loyalty if the whole truth had reached the throne of their Sovereign. His subjects have reason to believe that the truth has not been told. During three years of war Upper Canada was exposed to the ravages of a powerful and inveterate foe. The Government of the United States had been long concerting the invasion of this province. Hostile preparations against it had been long masked under other designs ; and at last the accumulated torrent of violence burst on the defencless children of the British empire. Nor were they assailed by the weapons of war alone ; an invidious proclamation preceded those host of the enemy forgetful of honour regardless of humanity and daring to seduce the subjects of Britain from their true allegiance. The subjects of Britain remained dauntless and firm. It was not for their property that they rose against their invaders ; the invader would have spared to them their property. They flew to arms in defence of the rights and sovereignty of Britain. Twice has the American standard been planted in Upper Canada while yet but a handful of British troops aided the native battalions wave the laurel of victory over the protrate intruders on their soil. The second year of war saw Canada contending with yet little assistance from the parent state. The second year of the war saw her sons confirmed in their virtue and still more determined to resist. Wives and children had fled from their homes ; the face of the country was laid waste and the fire of revenge was sent forth to consummate distress and misery ; still was the spirit of the people unextinguished still did it burn with patriotism and loyalty. By the third year every risk of conquest was at an end for now the British aid poured into the provinces and peace was proclaimed when war was no longer to be feared. It is now more than three years since there was an end of war but strange to say these years of peace have manifested no appearance of affection or care from the mother country to the Canadas. Commercial treaties have been made altogether neglectful of British interests here. Government transactions which used to give spirit to trade and are at a stand; troops are withdrawn ; fortifications are suffered to go to ruin ; and rumours are abroad too shocking to be repeated in the Royal ear. May it please your Royal Highness to listen calmly to the complains and grievances of the people of Upper Canada who are fully assured that your Royal Highness has been kept ignorant of most important truths ; who are well assured of the generous disposition of your Royal heart and of your desire that British subjects should every where share equally you paternal regard an affection. It was a matter of much provocation to the people of the province to see even during the war which afforded such striking proofs of their loyalty and valour reports went home highly rating the merits of regular troops while the tribute due to Canadian levies were unfairly set down may the principles of the most loyal subjects here were often stigmatised by British officers ignorant of human character and still more so of circumstances which affect it in this part of the world. It was not so with the immortal Brock. He justly appreciated Canadian worth and his memory will happily long cherish in the minds of the Canadian people a due regard for the genuine spirit of a British solider at once generous and brave. The loyal inhabitants of Upper Canada would disdain to notice the misrepresentations of individuals so contrary to notorious truth if these had not obviously conspired with other causes to lessen the regard which should subsist between British subjects here and at home to influence the conduct of Ministers towards the general interests of the province. The loyal subjects of his Majesty in Upper Canada suffered grievously during the war in their property and many were bereft of their all. A solemn investigation on this subject took place ; the claims of the sufferers were authenticated and there was every reason to expect that recompence would immediately follow ; yet nothing has followed but delay and insult. Surely if there is among mankind a single principle of justice that is one that the individuals of a nation ought not partially to bear the weight of public calamity. Surely individuals who have exposed their lives for Government should not be disgusted with finding Government regardless of those very principles which it is intended to sustain. The people of this province are well aware that their fellow subjects at home are pressed hard with taxations and far it is from their wish that relief should be afford from thence. Canada contains within itself ample means of exonerating Government from the claims of sufferers by war ; and it is within the fiat[?] of your Royal Highness to remove by a signle breath the evil now justly complained of. Millions of acres of fertile lands lie here at the disposal of your Royal Highness upon the credit of which under proper management not only the fair claims of loyal sufferers could be instantly advanced but vast sums could be raised for the improvement of the provinces and the increase of revenue to Britain. Another grievance manifesting the neglect of Government to the concerns of Upper Canada is equally notorious and must be still more abhorrent to the general feelings of your Royal Highness. The young men of this province who were armed in its defence had for their spirited conduct the promise of their commanders that land would be granted them as a reward for their services as soon as war was terminated ; and after this promise was universaly confided in the Parliament of Upper Canada passed an extraordinary law in the face of established British principles that militia should pass beyond the frontier. With these promises and in obedience to this law the militia passed beyond the frontier with alacrity ; yet since the peace the greater part of them had been denied the pledge of their extraordinary services and the land is unjudtly withheld. The petition further states that such ingratitude such dishonour such errors in policy could not exist without extraordinary influences and it recommends most important changes equally for the glory of the throne and benefit of the subject. It says that the scandalous abuses came some years ago to such a pitch of monstrous ingratitude the the home Ministers wisely imposed restriction on the Land Council of Upper Canada. It seems however that all this was insufficient and that confusion on confusion has grown out of this unhappy system. Upper Canada it is now said pines in comparative decay and that discontent and poverty are experienced in a land supremely blessed with the gifts of nature. It is insisted that the immediate interference of his Royal Highness might do much to remove the evils which spring from the system of patronage and favouritism and it asserts that the interposition of the British Parliament is more imperiously required. It concludes as follows:– Deeply penetrated with these sentiments and most seriously inclined to have changes speedily effected the loyal subjects of Great Britain dwelling in Upper Canada now take the extraordinary step of sending home Commissioners to bear this to the throne and humbly intreat your Royal Highness to give ear to the details which it will be in their power to relate: above all that your Royal Highness would immediately send out to this province a commission consisting of discreet and wise men men of business and talent who shall be above every influence here and who may be instructed to make inquiry into all the sources of evil.  ID129,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,09,05,inform,Canada The inhabitants of Upper Canada have had another meeting under the title of a Convention at York ; when they came to the following resolutions ; Richard Beasely Esq. in the chair :– Resolved–1. That whilst this Convention holds it one one of the most sacred right of British subjects at all times directly to petition the throne of their Sovereign relative to their grievances yet nevertheless under the present peculiar existing circumstances of this country the Members of this Convention as well out of respect to that Honourable Body the Commons House of Assembly of Upper Canada as for other causes deem it their indispensable duty on this important occasion to recommend in the strongest terms to their fellow subjects resident in this province a spirit formal and respectful application to that Honourable House for an inquiry into the state of the province. 2. That John Clarke Cyrus Sumner and Roderick Drake Esqs. be a permanent Committee for the management of the affairs of the Convention and that they as soon as may be practicable prepare a respectful petition praying for inquiring and expressive of grievances (for the sanction of this Convention) to be by them circulated for subscribers and presented at the bar of the House of Assembly at their next meeting session. That the said Committee be further authorised to frame and Address to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent on the subject of grievances believed to exist in Upper Canada which when approved of by the Convention shall be submitted by the Committee together with the petition above mentioned to the Honourable House of Assembly at their next meeting for their alterationg and amendment. Mr Gourlay who has had so instrumental a hand in instigating these proceedings is stated to have been arrested and held to bail at Kingston for distributing a printed account of the state of grievances of the people of the Niagara district ; and this by direction of the AttorneyGeneral of the province who is reported to have influenced the Justice who signed the warrant by certain threats of vengeance if he refused. Another report is mentioned as being in circulation namely that official instruction have been sent to particular Magistrates to take notice of and transmit to Government the names of all persons holding commissions civil or military who engage in the measures of petitioning the Prince Regent as recommended by Mr Gourlay in order that they may be removed from their offices. The Upper Canada Convention met at York on the 6th inst. under the Presidency of Richard Bearly Esq. J. P. It has styled itself a Convention of Friends to Free Inquiry and resolved to change the proposed plan of sending deputies to England with a petition to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent confining itself to an application to the House of Assembly for an inquiry into the state of the province and a petition to his Royal Highness to be presented to Sir Peregrine Maitland for transmission.– From the Quebec Gazette of July 31.  ID144,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,06,02,inform,Colonial Intelligence Advices have been received again from the Cape of Good Hope of 6th March which are several days later than those acquired formerly. Of the rising of the Caffres there remains no doubt although it does not appear that Government have as yet received official information regarding it. The private accounts state that two valuable officers had lost their lives and also a great number of men. The Governor himself in order by his presence the sooner to suppress the Caffres had with a competent force proceeded to the interior. Great inconvenience was experienced for the want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not this been the case it was believed that in a very few days tranquility would have been restored. We are sorry to state that another hurricane has taken place in the Isle of France ; it commenced on the 25th January and has done great mischief to the shipping and also to the plantations of that ill-fated Island. A Dutch mail has arrived with papers to the 19th inst. At Batavia two of the leaders of the late disturbances have been tried and execute and that degree of tranquility which terror produces has been restored. In the administration of their colonies in the east the conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and oppressive ; and it is to be regretted that the extensive and fertile island of Java should have been surrendered to their rapacity. During the short time that it was in possession of this country various important improvements were introduced into its domestic administration ; the practise of torture according to the humane and enlightened maxims of British jurisprudence was abolished ; new and better modes of collecting the revenue were adopted ; and a spirit of mildness and of regard for the interests of all the various classes of which the population is composed was evinced which made the British Government highly popular. Considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants for the safety of the Queen Charlotte Jamaica packet. She sailed from Jamaica the 29th March and had a great quantity of specie on board. No things have since been received of her. Several vessels sailed since her departure and have arrived safe. The Ocean quitted Jamaica on the 6th of April and arrived here several days since. Several passengers landed at Portsmouth on Thursday from Jamaica bring Port Royal Papers to the 25th of March. The 50th Regiment had arrived at Kingston from Cork ; and the 2nd West India Regiment was about to embark for Sierra Leone to be disbanded.  ID186,Glasgow Herald,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1821,02,05,inform,Emigration. The following is an extract of a letter dated Louisville August 12th 1820 from a Scotchman who has been long settled in America to his friend a Scotch Farmer who rents 500 acres of land in the County of Middlesex. The circumstances in which this country is placed at present are truly melancholy when compared to what they have been ; yet still it is a better country to live in than Britain. It is not easy to make money by farming at present in the United States for the want of a market; and I am of opinion that things will not mend in this respect for some years for all are sellers and none buyers. All kinds of produce are selling or rather offered for sale at one-third of what prices were two years ago. Land of course has fallen in the same ratio. The best of cleared land within from 5 to 10 miles of this town is offered for them from 10 to 20 dollars an acre. You will thence conclude that this is a favourable time to purchase – and that for a man who has a little money and a large family able and willing to labour with their hands this is a most excellent country as he can easily raise on this cheap land all the necessaries and many of the luxuries of life. He will find it difficult to get gold or silver or even our own bad bank notes; but a man cannot be badly off with more beef mutton pork and grain than he can dispose of. He has no rent to make up by term day: his taxes are next to nothing and although he may grumble to have to turn his pigs into his corn field to save the expense of reaping it or to see his apples rotting under his trees by barn-fulls because he has not room or use for them yet still these are beatable distresses compared to those of the poor farmers in our native land and as I suppose in England. To the wealthier farmer the change is not beneficial or desirable. It is true that if he stays long in Britain he will soon become less wealthy; yet still he would for some time regret the change. He would miss many things made necessary by habit; he would find his servants more lazy and less obedient ; and he would even experience pain because the modes of farming he is accustomed to will not do here; but when he gets over these things he will find the advantage of the change. To say nothing of the difference of the Government and the satisfaction of chusing one's own rulers there are many desirable things here. I estimate as the greatest the ease of providing for one's family. A man may with very little exertion leave to all his children land enough to make them independent. Hence that sickening anxiety about the future fate of a family is little known here.  ID208,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1828,06,25,inform,House of Commons.–June 19. The Speaker took the Chair at a few minutes before four o'clock and was shortly afterwards summoned by the Deputy Usher of the Black Rod to attend the House of Lords. The Speaker stated on his return that the Royal Assent had been given by Commission to several public and private bills. Mr C. Dundas presented a petition from Newbury in the county of Berks praying for the abolition of slavery in the West Indies. Mr Planta moved for a new writ for the election of a member to serve in Parliament in the room of Lord Leveson Gower who had accepted the office of ChiefSecretary for Ireland.–Ordered. Ale-House Licensing Bill. On the motion of Mr Estcourt the house resolved itself into a committee on this bill. On the clause that no brewer who should himself supply public houses with beer should be allowed to act or assist as a Magistrate at any meeting or session for the granting of licenses Mr Bernal moved that this clause be struck out altogether. Mr R. Gordon supported the clause. Mr Monck thought this the most valuable clause in the bill and that it was no infringemnt but a salutary interference with the jurisdiction of borough magistrates. Strangers were ordered to withdraw and the committee divided when there were–Ayes 46–Noes 53– Majority against the clause 7. Several amendments verbal and otherwise were then agreed to amongst which was the omission of the words Cinque Ports thus excluding that class of places from the operation of the bill. On the clause being proposed relative to the hours during which public houses should be kept open on Sundays. Mr Estcourt said the original clause was to the effect that public-houses should be closed during the hours of morning and afternoon's divine service but he thought it would be better not to permit publicans to allow drinking or tippling on their premises till after the usual hour of the conclusion of morning service (one o'clock.) After a conversation in which several hon. members participated the clause was agreed to. Several other clauses having been then read and agreed to the house resumed ; the report was brought up ordered to be taken into further consideration on Monday next and printed. The Usury Laws. Mr P. Thompson moved the second reading of the usury laws amendment bill. Mr Davenport said he should oppose the bill as he considered it to be highly injurious both to the landed and commercial interests. The hon. members moved an amendment that the bill be read a second time that day three months. The question on th amendment having been put The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested the propriety of postponing this bill until the next session of parliament. He made this suggestion from no unfriendly feeling towards the bill but merely because this was not he conceived the most convenient time to consider it. The subject ought to be fully considered with a view to get rid of evils that existed without interfering with long-continued prejudices. If the discussion were postponed he would give the subject the best attention in his ( hear.) Mr Heathcote approved of the suggestion of the right hon. gentleman and wished the discussion on the question to be postponed till the next session of parliament. Mr L. Foster thought that between the total repeal or the continued existence of the Usury Laws in their present shape a middle course might be steered. Of the bill before the house he thought that under the guise of a simple enactment it covered one of the greatest illusion ever held forth to Parliament or the country for he was convinced that it would effect as complete and as practicable a repeal of the usury laws as could be proposed. It became necessary therefore to consider the probable operation of that repeal upon all the great interest of the country. The bill might give relief to few but would bring injury to many. Lord Palmerston thought the house indebted to the hon. member for Dover for bringing in the bill. It might be possible to form a bill better than that of the hon. member but his bill was better than the present law and as such he should vote for it. The gallery was then cleared and the house divided when there appeared for the second reading–Ayes 52; Noes 40 : majority in favour of the second reading 12. Voters' Registration Bill. Lord Nugent moved the second reading of the voters' registration bill and said that his object in carrying it through the present stage was that the bill might be committed pro forma for the purpose of having certain amendment introduced into it. It would then be printed with its amendments in order that the house and the country might have the opportunity of considering its details between this and the next session of Parliament. Sir R. Wilson moved as an amendment that the bill might be read a second time that day six months. Mr H. Gurney seconded the amendment. The question was then put on the amendment which was agreed to and the bill was ordered to be read a second time this day six months. Salmon Fisheries Preservation Bill. On the motion of the Chancellor of Exche- quer the house resolved itself into a committee on the salmon fisheries preservation bill. Mr Ferguson proposed the insertion of a clause exempting from the operation of the bill the salmon fisheries in the River and Bay of Thurso in the county of Caithness which are the exclusive property of Sir John Sinclair. After some conversation the gallery was cleared and the committee divided when the clause was lost. The bill having passed through the committee the report was ordered to be received this day. The other orders were then disposed of and the house adjourned at half-past two o'clock. Friday June 20. Sir G. Murray took the oaths and his seat on his re-election for the county of Perth. A number of petitions were presented against the continuance of Negreo Slavery. Irish Currency. Sir G. Hill presented a petition from the Chamber of Commerce of the city of Londonderry praying that the bill for amending the laws relating to Banks in Ireland might not be allowed to make further progress for the present. The petition was laid on the table. Sir A. Chichester presented a petition from Belfast praying a reduction of the duty on coals in Ireland which was laid upon the table. Scotch Gaols' Bill. The Lord Advocate in moving that this bill be read a second time and printed observed that it was not his intention to press it further during the present Session. No man could however deny that the object of the Bill was of great importance and he proposed therefore to have its provisions made generally known throughout the country in order that it might be again presented to the house in as perfect a shape as possible. The bill was then read a second time and ordered to be printed. Committee of Supply. In the committee of supply a number of grants of minor importance were agreed to. Sir H. Hardinge said he had another resolution to propose but it was in which he expected that a reduction would be made next year. It was that a sum of L283199 8s 1d be granted for the expenses of the disembodied[?] militia of the united kingdom. Mr Spring Rice said that within the last twelve years there had been two millions and a half expended on this body and that the subject was one which few gentlemen took the trouble to look at. He begged to say a word upon the Irish militia. There the whole of the staff which was larger than that of England was without a private man. Nothing could a more outrageous job than that of the milita in Ireland. The colonels kept the whole patronage of the regiment and kept up the bands for the amusemen of themselves and friends. The militia might have been of service at one time in Ireland ; but since that time the present effective police had been established and quite superseded it. He trusted Ministers would not suffer this to remain if they really wished to be economical and curtail if not abolish it. The Chancellor of the Exchequer begged to assure his hon. friend that he wanted no prompting to make any economical reduction. When however a plan for the reduction of the staff was ready and it was in contemplation it would be laid before Parliament and he should then be the friend of the definite and limited powers to which he had alluded. Mr Hume said the militia had been defended as though the country were in hourly danger of invasion –as if the country could be taken by surprise. If that were so he would gladly learn of what use were the spies who cost us L450000 a-year. We had ambassadors–they were very little better than spies–at an expense of L45000a-year ; and if their cautious observance were not sufficient to save the country from sudden invasion he knew no better means and he certainly knew no other advantage which ambassadors and consuls could be of. New South Wales Bill–Committee. On the order of the day having been read for the house resolving itself into committee on the New South Wales bill. Mr Huskisson moved that the Speaker do leave the chair. Sir J. Mackintosh said the object of his present motion of which he had previously given notice was to propose two instruction to the committee on the bill which the right hon. gentleman (Mr Huskisson) had introduced–first to the effect that the committee should recommend the introduction of a clause for the establishment of a trial by jury in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land; and secondly that it should recommend that a clause be introduced providing for the election of one-third of the Legislative Council from among persons enjoying an income of L100 a year and having been free inhabitants of the colonies for the space[?] of three years. The best local authories in favour of his proposition. Among these he might mention the names of Governor Hunter Governor Bligh Mr Bent the Judge Advocate Governor Macquarrie and his successor Sir Thomas Brisbane who had gone out to the colony prejudiced against the introduction into it of these institutions ; but after two years careful investigation of the subject wrote home in Oct. 1825 stating that there was now no longer any doubt about its perfect ripeness for them.–( Hear hear.)– The partial introduction of English institutions into immediate practise was the only pledge of a real intention on the part of government to introduce them more completely in the end. The right hon. gent. concluded by moving that instruction be given to the committee to recommend the introduction of Trial by Jury into the colony and to allow the inhabitants a voice in the legislative councils. Mr Huskisson said in the bill which he had introduced it was intended to extend the privilege to the government of the country of granting trial by jury in all civil cases. His right hon. friend would find if he examined that the foundation would be laid of granting the inhabitants of that colony a share in managing their own concerns. At present the legislature proposed by way of a first step to appoint a legislative committee for the purpose of watching and controuling every measure of the state. All trials should be public under the inspection of a free press and a population jealous of their rights. They should now be prepared in the course of a few years for the regular introduction of a legislative assembly ; not had he any fears when such a change should take place that it would lead to any political convulsion. Mr Hume had every reason to believe that if instead of inflicting a military governemtn they would introduce a portion of representation and the privileges of British subjects into New South Wales it would be the most flourishing of the colonies. Mr Horace Twiss said the knowledge of one fact might obviate the necessity for one at least of the right hon. gent.'s propsitions namely that the governor of the colony had the power of extending to the colonists the right of trial by jury if he should deem it expedient. Sir James Mackintosh here intimated that he should not press his amendments. They were accordingly negatived. The house then resolved itself into the Committee when several verbal amendments were proposed and agreed to. The bill then went through the committee and the report with the amendments was ordered to be brought up on Monday. The other orders of the day were then disposed of and the house adjourned at half-past two o'clock.  ID211,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1829,05,20,inform,Australia. –We understand the celebrated navigator Captain Parry has been appointed the Director of the Australian Agricultural Company. He proceeds to that colony immediately ; the salary is stated to be very handsome.  ID216,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1830,04,24,inform,The King's Health. It will be seen from our private letter that unfavourable accounts respecting his Majesty's health were circulating in London at 7 o'clock on Wednesday evening. In our last we alluded to the suspicions which the non-appearance of bulletins for four days after the first gave rise to. On Monday a second bulletin appeared certainly not of a character to remove the public anxiety and this has been followed by two days' silence. Every one naturally puts the question If his Majesty is better why not state this in a bulletin that the thousand discouraging rumours in circulation may be put to rest? The Morning Chronicle says that the high officers of State are not much better informed on the subject than others and that a knowledge of his Majesty's real condition is confined to the very few immediately around his person. In the absence of correct information inferences are drawn from every passing circumstance. It was observed that Sir Henry Halford very shortly after his return from Windsor on Tuesday morning had a long interview with the Duke of Wellington ; and it has not escaped notice that his Majesty's sister the Duchess of Gloucester had been sent for to visit him. The Globe says that according to reports which are circulated in high quarters his Majesty's illness excites considerable alarm and that gout in the stomach is complicated with dropsical symptoms. What credit may be due to these statements we cannot tell; but whether they be true or false they furnish a reason for the publication of official intelligence. The King's health is a matter which concerns the public deeply and all mystery and deception on the subject are most reprehensible. We refer to our London head for a variety of articles upon the subject ; and if this night's mail bring any additional information of importance we shall publish it in a secoond edition. The two Houses of Parliament meet again on Monday. We publish the address of the Birmingham Union to day and meant to accompany it with some remarks but have only time at present to express out regret that so masterly a paper dealing in great and immutable principles should have its value lessened by being so much mixed up with ephemeral matters and with false or questionable doctrines respecting currency. The passion for emigrating to Swan River has not received any check. There are four ships now at London and as many more at other ports which are preparing to sail for the settlement with passengers. Indeed the numbers who are flying from the country at this moment who are we believe quite unprecedented. Within the last ten days we have seen notices of fifteen ships that were loading with emigrants at Hull twelve at Waterford and several at Bristol Liverpool and Greenock all destined we think for the United States or British America. The exportation of human beings from the British Isles to different quarters of the world must now be proceeding at the rate of one or two thousand per week. It will be remembered that according to reports from India received some time ago Lord William Bentick had issued an order abolishing those horrid human sacrifices the Suttees. Doubts were thrown upon this intelligence when the subject was lately talked of in Parliament ; but we are happy to say that its accuracy is confirmed by the arrival of the official document. It is disgraceful to the British Indian Government that it has been hitherto either so callous that it overlooked this enormity or so ignorant of its own resources and the true state of the people under its authority as to believe that it had not power to effect its abolition. The report of a revolution having taken place in Chili is confirmed in letters from Bogota. The constitutional Director Pinto has been driven out of the capital by General Prieto with an armed force and great excesses are said to have been committed. A small fleet sailed lately from Cadiz for Havannah with 2000 soldiers on board. The expedition is supposed by some to be intended for the invasion of Mexico ; but it is more likely to find employment in keeping down the elements of insurrection in Cuba– The plot to which we alluded in our last seems to have excited much alarm. Some of the most opulent families in the island with several lawyers and official persons were concerned in it. Their object was as we conjectured to convert the island into an independent republic. From a detailed list published in the French papers it appears that the expedition against Algiers is to be composed of 34000 men infantry cavalray and artillery. Farther intelligence has been received from the capital of Colombia to the 14th of February. A warm address had been presented by the Congress to Bolivar entreating him not to abandon the republic at a moment when its existence was menaced by conspiracies; and he seems to have once more consented to remain in office. Commissioners had been appointed to proceed to Valentia and endeavour to accomodate the differences between the people of Venezuela and the central government by peaceable means. If these failed it was determined to employ force. The Congress was in session at Bogota and was proceeding to fulfil the object for which it had been assembled by drawing up a new constitution. The bases are published and though the present only an imperfect sketch of its plan they disclose one or two features which seem to be characteristic. The government is to be central as it has hitherto been not federal like that of the United States which has served as a model to Mexico Guatemala and La Plata. In the one case the supreme authority is vested in a single legislature which meets in the capital ; in the other it is divided among a number of local assemblies while the general congress representing the whole wields no other powers than what is necessary to hold the separate members in a state of union. The federal system which leaves to every province the management of its own concerns has advantages for a settled and enlightened community ; but whether it is equally adapted to the circumstances of an ignorant people newly escaped from political convulsions is very questionable. There seems however to be a partiality for the federal system in the new world ; and to humour this feeling the new constitution provides that Chambers of Districts shall be established with powers to decide on all municipal and local affairs. The difficulty will be to give these bodies the powers necessary to develope the industry and resources of the country without permitting them to impose taxes and exercise other legislative functions which will interfere with the business of the general government. Another articl state that the members of the Senate and House of Representatives are to hold their seats for a considerable time in order to avoid the inconveniences resulting from frequent changes or the repeated election of the same person. In the mouth of an English statesman we should consider this vile sophistry ; but allowance must be made for the res dur? novitas regni in a new state like Colombia formed of heterogenous elements among which it is not easy to establish any principle of cohesion. One the same grouns the Columbian legislators may be pardoned for resolving that the Catholic religion is that of the state and that no other shall be permitted. This is merely a concescession for the sake of peace to prejudice which the government is not strong enough to subdue and cannot defy without great danger. Nothing is said about the mode of election or the power of the President two points of vital consequence which may give a new complexion to the whole scheme. We have made these remarks on the proposed constitution because it probably holds out the last chance of composing the trouble of Columbia. If it does not satisfy the people other provinces will soon follow the example of Venezuela and all the address and influence of Bolivar will not prevent the republic from splitting into four or five independent communities whose mutual jealousness and wars will crush the librties and destroy the prosperity of the whole. Private Correspondence. London Wednesday Evening. The King's Health We are sorry to state that the private accounts received from Windsor this afternoon do not speak so favourably of his Majesty's health as the Court Circular and most of the assertions of the papers published this afternoon.

The plan on which this undertaking is to be conducted is explained in a work entitled England and America. This first act of Mr Stanley's successor is an earnest of his becoming a most valuable Minister for the colonies of this country.  ID241,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1834,07,23,inform,Australian Emigration Bill. –Mr W. Whitmore brough in a bill for establishing a colony in Southern Australia. The bill was read a first time and ordered to be read a second time on Wednesday next.  ID245,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1834,11,11,inform,Colonel C. J. Napier has been appointed Governor of the embryo colony in South Australia and we believe that a fitter appointment could not have been made. We only regret that Colonel Napier has not been sent to superintend a colony founded on something like sane principles. But if this Australian project end as we have little doubt it will do in the ruin of those who are weak and silly enough to embark in it no one will ascribe any part of the failure to the incapacity or unfitness of the Governor. The whole blame will fall on the contrivers of the scheme.  ID259,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1836,07,16,inform,Every thing is jobbed Female Emigration to Australia &c. (From a Correspondent.) Our penal settlements appear to be very indifferently managed; and we are glad to find that such a man as Sir John Franklin is appointed to govern Van Diemen's Land; and the sooner an improved system is adopted for New South Wales the better. Not only are men sent out to govern who are ignorant of human nature a knowledge of which is essential to the management of the heterogenous materials of our penal colonies; but when the Government at home opens its eyes to any proposal for improvementit is mismanaged. Our rulers have the sense to see the importance of sending our respectable females to these colonies ; but they trust an Emigration Committee and this committee trusts individuals who desire to make the most of the concern ; and we are glad to have an opportunity of making the public acquainted with the mode in which the business is conducted in the hope that some humane Member of Parliament will take the subject up. The mode of managing female emigration is this :– A temptation in the first place is held out of a free passage to Australia. A ship is hired and this ship must ave a full cargo to satisfy the owners. Advertisements are issued and instead of hard working females a parcel of decayed governesses dressmakers &c. &c. with a small mixture of better articles is made up. But if as almost always happens a sufficient number of these to fill the ship does not come forward a supply of sweepings is taken from a workhouse! Here then is such a mixture of good bad and indifferent to the amount of two hundred and upwards that there is enough of evil to corrupt the good. As to the comfort of the poor creatures they are crammed four into one bed ! Such is the power of jobbing that we happen to know the fact that some young women of respectability who wished to go to New South Wales with their friends were refused a free passage unless they went to London to go in the Government ship ! Thus we see that the interests of agents and shipowners overcomes the interests of the colonies and actually obstructs the attainment of the object in view. We find blindness a very common ailment in every department of Government ; and however desirous our rulrs may be to reform every abuse and to adopt useful measures they are often thwarted by the necessity (which ought not to exist) of conciliating harpies and leeches which devour the public substance and suck the public blood. Reform has as yet only begun to clean the outside of the platter ; and it may not reach the inside in our day. It is the duty however of all patriots to sharpen the knife that is to cut out corruption from the heart of the commonwealth by means of exposure of every abuse that comes to be known and to support those who are willing to apply it. As in a matter of so much importance nothing should be concealed there is no hesitation in stating that it consists with our knowledge that after the Emigration Committee in Van Diemen's Land detailing the deplorable consequences of sending out young women from workhouses a ship has actually sailed nearly filled up as we have described. When any representation is made to a public office the matter is said to belong to another department ; and that other department says it is not its province to interfere ; and thus humanity is made the shuttlecock to the battledore of jobbing and the blindness of office. If our brethren of the press will take up this the inhuman job will be put an end to.  ID324,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,21,inform,Extract of a letter from Norfolk (Virginia) Oct. 26. We learn from the West Country that the Kentucky Convention has determined in favour of a separation and large preparations are making in the country for offensive operations against the Indians who have committed so many murders and harassed the country so much that it can no longer be endured.

Wednesday Dec. 8. The SPEECH of George Washington Esq; President of the Congress on??? the ??? Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives I N meeting you again I feel much satisfac tion on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary. In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of 3000000 of florins towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in Holland.–As well theexchange with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information. Since your last sessions I have received communication by which it appears that the district of Kentucke at present a part of Virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honour to both the par ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you. It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity. These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended. The disturbed situation of Europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge in means and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil. Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection. The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom whether improvement of a judicatory system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom whether im provements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts be not desirable through all the States. The patronage of our commerce of our merchants and seamen has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect. The establishment of the Militia of a Mint of Standards of Weights and Measures of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favourite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents. Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives. In perusing the various and weighty business of the present session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.

The Legislature have also resolved that a Convention be called for taking into consideration the constitution of the United States; the members to be elected in December and the Convention to Meet the first week in Jauary. The Legislature have adjourned to meet again on the first Thursday in January for the purpose (we suppose) of choosing Senators and affixing the time and manner of electing Representatives for Congress. New York Nov. 18. The following resolution has passed the House of Representatives of the State of Virginia now in session: Resolved That so much of this act entitled An Act making provision for the provision for the debt of the United States in their redemption of the public debt is dangerous to the rights and subversive of the interest of the people; and demands the marked disapprobation of the General Assembly. Portland Nov. 15. The stone work of the light house at the entrance of our harbour is now completed. On Tuesday the 9th instant the last stone was laid by Mr. Nichols of this town master builder. The work is extremely well executed. The lighthouse is now 70 feet high. To this the lanthorn which is to be six feet in diameter will add about 15 feet 85 feet in whole. The lanthorn is now preparing and will probably be raised and lighted by the first of next month. Baltimore Nov. 23. A society of respectable gentlemen of this place have raised an adequate fund for the establishment of an extensive manufacture of gunpowder and the necessary mill-works will be speedily erected in the vicinity of this town. This important insituation will not only prove highly advantageous to this State and town but may if properly encouraged become a national benefit. York (Pennsylvania) Nov 10. From Wright's Ferry we learn that about four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon as a boat was coming from the East side a most tremendous storm arose when she was about half way over by which means she was soon filled with water and sunk. there was six passengers and the??? in her (besides a small light waggon and three horses viz. a clergyman the owner of the waggon with his wife and three children; when the storm came on the woman and children took shelter in the waggon but it continued to blow with such violence that the waggon was torn out of the boat and the body having by chance got loose from the carriage and being pretty tight floated some distance till its progress was stopped by a rock; the husband viewing the melancholy situations of his wife and children resolved to relieve or perish with them and quitting the boat swam to the waggon cut open the cover with his knife and with difficulty kept their heads above water till they were relieved by a boat from the West side; by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappeared; the Clergyman just as he found the boat sinking mounted his horse one of the boatmen mounted on one of the waggon horses and by this means preserved themselves till they were relieved by a boat; the other boatman of the name of Tim Sulivan depending on his skill in swimming got up an oar but it is thought he is drowned as he has not since been heard of; the boat was found in the falls and one of the waggon horses that had been given up for lost was found next day some distance below the falls with all his geers on and does not appear to have received the least injury. Extract of a letter from Sunbury Northumberland County (Pennsylvania) dated Nov. 13. One of the men who murdered the Indians at Pine Creek was tried on Saturday evening and though a number of witnesses clearly proved the hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed and the confession of his counsel at the bar that confirmed it yet notwithstanding an express charge from the judges to bring him in guilty the jury in a few moments returned with a verdict in his favour and a subscription to pay the costs of the suit that he might be immediately set at liberty; and all this from a most absurd idea which the Attorney General with all his endeavours could not beat out of them that the crime was not the same to kill an Indian as a white man: for some minuets the Chief Justice was mute with astonishment. How the State can pacify the Indians now Heaven knows while at this moment the other murderers are at large in this country and no one will arrest them.  ID335,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,05,09,inform,Halifax April 6. The late violent rains have done much damage in the country:–The bridge at Sackville is nearly torn down and the Mill there is much injured: the Bridge at Nine Mills River is partly carried away; and the different roads and causeways are supposed to have suffered more than 2000l. will repair. Since the retreat of the f–eral troops under General Harmar the Miami Indians have committed unparalleled cruelties. A large body of them on the 2d of February attacked the settlements called Big Bottom twenty miles from Harman on the Muilsingam which they entirely destroyed. Eleven men and two children were massacred two escaped and three were taken prisoners. Boston. The amount of the value of theexports from the United States for thirteen months agreeable to an estimate made at the Office of the Treasury in 20000000 dollars. The greatest apprehensions are entertained of an invasion from our savage neighbours; as accounts from Philadelphia state that there has been a confederation of all the South West Indians to fall on our frontiers early in the spring. Similiar apprehensions have driven the inhabitants in the country of Marcetta from their plantations into the city where they do military duty. According to the late Census the number of inhabitants in this commonwealth is 470000. Philadelphia April 7. Congress met here to-day and made a house Articles of the Constitution that were not liked by many of us are altered much for the better– among other things we were dissatisfied that not any notice was taken of Religion as we wanted it expressly declared that not any sect should ever be established in preference to another.–This is now done. In this part of the world we know not any thing of Toleration–all are equally free. It is said we have land for upwards of an hundred millions of people; we are yet about three so thatfor sometime we have have not any great cause to fight for territory.  ID97,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,09,12,entertain,The laws of the State of Pennsylvania and that of Massachusetts by which the punishment of death is abolished in all cases except for wilful murder are about to be adopted by the respective Legislatures of all the other States. The system of the great and merciful???caria has taken place of the sanguinary Penal laws of England. The abolition of Negro slavery which has taken shape in the five New England States of New Hampshire Massachusets Rhode island Connecticut and Vermont; in the Midland States of New York New Jersey Pennsylvania and Delawar; and in the Western State of Kentucky for several years past is now extended by act of Congress to the Southern States of Virginia North Carolina South Carolina Georgia and Maryland; and the emancipation of the remainder of that unfortunate race of men is to take place on or before the fifth of November 1795. The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts has g???ed a part of the public lands to the emancipated Negroes of that State in proportion to the numbers of the respective families where the liberal and philanthropic mind is gratified by seeing them erect villages cultivate farms and form communities of civilized Societies. Before the Gentleman who has favoured us with this Intelligence left America they had established a Lodge of Masonry; and he had the satisfaction of seeing them on a grand day parade to Church in all the magnificence of the Order where a sermon was preached on the occasion by one of their own colour. They have also endowed public schools employed??? and erected places of Public Worship. The Officers Non-commissioned Officers and Soldiers who served in the Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country have at last received a reward infinitely beyond their expectations but every way corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic. Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress this last Session to each individual who served throughout the war; and to the defendants of those who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature and eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran as has been the case of former grants he is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money at the present market price from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land and the rest in moneya s may be most agreeable to the receiver. The Mint of the United States which was established two years since has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles half eagles and quarter eagles. The first is exactly five and forty shillings English money or ten American coin. The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half and quater which makes the courie of exchange simple and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive that ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle. There is besides one more silver coin which is called a Dime and is the tenth part of a dollar. The copper coin is called a Cent and is the tenth part of a Dime. Six of the ships of war which were voted by Congress in November last are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next and will complete a fleet of??? hundred guns. The city of Washington which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground near the banks of the Potamac possessing a delightful water prospect together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city. From the President's house to the Capitol run two great pleasure parks or malls which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol as well as those of the President's house are of the finest marble. The building of these superb edifices has been much retarded by the want of stone cutters masons bricklayers carpenters and blacksmiths who at this time actually receive the enormous wages of ten shillings American currency per day. The district of Country at the back of North Carolina reaching to the Mississippi and covering a country six hundred miles long by three hundred broad is next winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the Province of Maine extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the river St. Croix is expected to form a Seventeenth. The new cities build in America since her independence are Grenville in the State of Georgia; Martenberg the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and Nashville in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville Fairfield and Lex ington in the State of Kentucky; Washington the Capital of the United States; Sunbury in the State of Pennsylvania; Hudson upon Husdon's River and Cooper's Town in the State of New York; Bennington in the State of Vermont; and Paterson in the State of New Jersey. All the towns burnt by the English in the was have been rebuilt and the old cities of Charlestown Baltimore Philadelphia New York and Boston have been extended to more than double the extent they had before the peace. The population of the United States by the last Census in 1790 was more than double what it was in 1775 by which it appears that America doubles her number of people every fifteen years. The emigrations from the different nations in Europe to that country are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually. The increase of farms and villages has been so great as to people four new States and to extend their Settlements from the Atlantic to the Ohio in the South and from the Atlantic to the Lakes on the River St. Lawrence in the North.  ID351,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,08,17,inform,By private letters and newspapers lately arrived from Philadelphia and New York we have informmation that the Indians are carrying on their depredations on the back settlements of the United States with great vigour; that an enquiry as to the miscarriage of the war had been made by Congress and an army was collected this year; that the Americans had some expectations of getting free of the Indian war by treaties. We have advices of Governor Clinton's being re-elected Governor of New York state by a majority of 180 but the friends of Mr. Tay were objecting to the return as the canvassers had not opened the boxes which contained the returns from three counties Otsego Clinton and Tioga which if opened they say would have given the election to Mr. Tay the county of Otsego alone being 300 majority in favours of Mr. Tay. A dreadful storm happened at New York on the 1st of July which continued with so much violence that several vessels were driven from their moorings and a number of boats upset and many lives lost.  ID382,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,09,28,inform,Extract of a letter from London Sept. 24. ??? the new duties established by Congress ??? on goods are the same through all the ???

Vermont Kentucky Indiana and The Western Territory. About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky ten years ago lay in forest wild it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has been the population that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants already in each of these States. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year 1789 and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States published in American in May last we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them called The Western Territory; and it must rerejoiced the heart of every Briton to read it and think that the settling of these countries though the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 20 years will long keep them from manufacturing and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman even though wages are very high when he can for twenty pounds purchase a thousand acres of land that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect that new channels of commerce will be opened and the inland parts of the Continent will require an incresing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation will be diffused through a country more fertile more susceptible of population and six time more extensive than all the Thirteen United States. The Western Territory Is the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi riverlb/>–north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania– south and south-east by the Ohio reiver; contains according to Mr. Hutchins Geographer General to the Congress 411000 square miles equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres from which he deducts forty-three millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hunred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the foederal government which is to be sold for the discharthe debt owing to the United States. But a very small proportion of theselands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*. On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements and already commenced*#x2013;one at Marietta the other at Miami. This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787 and already contains about 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi Ohio Muskingham Hockhocking Sioto Miami Wobash &c.–Coal and iron mines and salt pits abound in this State; the soil is excellent–as rich as can be imagined and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour. It is exceeding healthy pleasant and commodious–the most fertile sport of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States. The timber is tall and in great variety.–Streams for mills abound here. Wheat indigo hemp and cotton thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties and justify the descrpition of travellers who call it the *garden of of a great empire will be fixed in some future pethe world*. It is here probably also that the centre riod. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accomodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with wild game of every kind; herds of deers elks bear &c. fill the extensive meadows of this country–turkies geese swans and partridges &c. are innumerable. The rivers are excellently stored with fish and almost all navigable for small sloops. In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30000 persons' and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States. Rejoice O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you and you *only* *No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum.
