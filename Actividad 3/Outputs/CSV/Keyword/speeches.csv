Washington at the opening of the Congress of the United States at New York Nov. 6 1792 gives an impartial account of the situation of tha country we are persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives IT is some abatement of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our western frontier have terminated: You will I am persuaded learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the further effusion of blood–to arrest the progress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable purposes:–In making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the event or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable; to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case. A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thus far will I trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them indeed is still depending; but a favorable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by anything that has yet happened. In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will I presume be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased. It must add to your concern to be informed that besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it. A part of the Cherokees known by the name of Chickamagas inhabiting five villages on the Tennessee River have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements. It was hoped that the treaty of Holston made with the Cherokee Nation in July 1791 would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter. The information which has been received on this subject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive precautions only have been enjoined and observed. It is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever on the part of the United States or their citizens is even alleged as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter. I have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete and pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable. In looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year. This however will be better ascertained in the course of the session; and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostilities. I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory–To enable by competent rewards the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable. The prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated–This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United States. These impediments have lessened and are lessened in local extent; and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the law appears to be progressive. But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters I judged a special interposition on my part proper and advisable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto. Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders. And Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend upon me shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws. In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of the Government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens. I can not forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the structure of the system which in some cases tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this subject provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the courts of the United States and a supplementary definition of offenses against the constitution and laws of the union and of the punishment for such offenses will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention. Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary. It would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your consideration of the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations and other infractions of the law of nations which furnishes just subject of complaint might endanger our peace with them. And in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose which takes place if not renewed at the close of the present session. In execution of the authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our mint; others have been employed at home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them. The regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage as being essential to their due operation and to order in our money concerns will I doubt not be resumed and completed. It is represented that some provisions in the law which establishes the Post-Office operate in experiment against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should this upon due enquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and infor mation will I doubt not lead to the application of a remedy. The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky has been notified to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order. It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for three millions of florins–one at Antwerp at the annual interest of four and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all charges.–The rates of these loans and the circumstances under which they have been made are confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad. Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives. I entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effec tual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the government –no measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation. Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made of the Bank of the United States pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made. Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and I doubt not will engage your early attention. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. I content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you. Various temporary laws will expire during the present session. Among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will merit particular notice. The results of your common deliberations hitherto will I trust be productive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents; such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment upon which under Divine Providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness. Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivation of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils.  ID105,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,10,03,inform,Upper Canada York July 28. Yesterday at an early hour his Honour Isaac Brock Esq. administering the Government of Upper Canada and Major-General commanding his Majesty's forces therein arrived at this place from Fort-George and accompanied by a numerous suite proceeded to the Government Building at four p.m. when he opened the present extra session of the Legislature and delivered the following speech to both houses :– Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislature Council and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly The urgency of the present crisis is the only consideration which would have induced me to call you together at a time when public as well as private duties elsewhere demand your care and attention. But Gentlemen when invaded by an enemy whose avowed object is the entire conquest of this province the voice of loyalty as well as of interest calls aloud to every person in the sphere in which he is placed to defend his country. Our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it ; they have evinced by the promptitude and loyalty of their conduct that they are worthy of the King whom they serve and of the constitution which they enjoy ; and it affords me particular satisfaction that while I address you as Legislators I speak to mean who in the day of danger will be ready to assist not only with their counsels but with their arms. We look Gentlemen to our militia as well as to the regular forces for our protection ; but I should be wanting to that important trust committed to my care if I attempted to conceal (what experience the great instructor of mankind especially of legislators has discovered) that amendment in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient. It is for you to consider what further improvements they still may require. Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly From the history and experience of our mother country we learn that in times of actual invasion or internal commotion the ordinary course of criminal laws has been found in adequate to secure his Majesty's Government from private treachery as well as from open disaffection ; and that at such times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws restraining for a limited period the liberty of individuals in many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the particulars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion of the province might justify me in the exercise of the full power reposed in me on such an emergency yet it will be more agreeable to me to receive the sanction of the Houses. A few traitors have already joined the enemy–have been suffered to come into the country with impunity–and have been harboured and concealed in the interior ; yet the general spirit of loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of this province is such as to authorise a just expectation that their efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing– The disaffected I am convinced are few–To protect and defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations is an object worthy of your most serious deliberations. The speech concludes with a call for supplies. Proclamation The unprovoked declaration of war by the United States of America against the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and its dependencies has been followed by the actual invasion of this province in a remote frontier of the western districts by a detachment of the United States. The officer commanding that detachment has thought proper to invite his Majesty's subjects not merely to a quiet and unresisting submission but insults them with a call to seek voluntarily the protection of his Government. Without condescending to repeat the illiberal epithets bestowed in this appeal of the American Commander to the people of Upper Canada on the administration of his Majesty every inhabitant of the province is desired to seek the confutation of such indecent slander in the review of his own particular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian subject who can truly affirm to himself that he has been injured by the Government in his person his property or his liberty? Where is to be found in any part of the world a growth so paid in prosperity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled not thirty years by a band of veterans exiled from their former possessions on account of their loyalty not a descendant of these brave people it to be found who under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment superior to what were possessed by their ancestors. This unequalled prosperity would not have been attained by the utmost liberality of the Government or the persevering industry of the people had not the maritime power of the mother country secured to its colonists a safe access to every market where the produce of their labour was in request. The unavoidable and immediate consequence of a separation from Great Britain must be the loss of this inestimable advantage and what is offered to you in exchange? To become a territory of the United States and share with them that exclusion from the ocean which the policy of their Government enforces ; you are not even flattered with a participation of their boasted independence ; and it is but too obvious that once exchanged from the powerful protection of the United Kingdom you must be re-annexed to the dominion of France from which the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms of Great Britain at vast expence of blood and treasure from no other motive than to relieve her ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire of France was the stipulated reward for the aid afforded to the revolted colonies now the United States ; the debt is still due and there can be no doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consideration for commercial advantages or rather for an expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over the commercial world. Are you prepared inhabitants of Canada to become willing subjects or rather slaves to the despot who rules the nation of Europe with a rod of iron? If not arise in a body exert your energies co-operate cordially with the King's regular forces to repel the invader and do not give cause to your children when groaning under the oppression of a foreign master to reproach you with having too easily parted with the richest inheritance of this earth–a participation in the name character and freedom of Britain. [The proclamation concludes with a declaration that should the Americans refused quarter in consequence of Indians being found in Canadian ranks that a severe and rigorous retaliation will take place.] Isaac Brock Major-Gen. and President Head-quarters Fort George July 22 1812.  ID106,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,10,03,inform,Quebec Papers Provincial Parliament of Lower Canada Legislative Council –Aug 1. This day at two o'clock his Excellency the Governor in Chief went in the usual state to the Legislative Council Chamber and being seated on the Throne the Gentlemen Usher of the Black Rod was sent to command the presence of the Assembly which being come up the Honourable Speaker of the Assembly said– May it please your Excellency His Majesty's faithful subjects the representatives of the province of Lower Canada have passed a bill intituled An Act of facilitate the Circulation of Army Bills. Their loyalty and the happiness of this province in being connected with and powerfully protected by the British nation are the basis of their constitution and the just grounds which gave rise to the formation of the militia and the firm determination to defend this country against the unexpected and unjust war that the United States have lately declared ; they are therefore under the greatest obligation to your Excellency for having communicated to them your wise precautions on the means to ameliorate and insure for several years the punctual payment of the army by circulating bills the reimbursement of which is guaranteed in England. To give them greater credit the bill limits the sums necessary and moreover provides for the interest the advantages accruing therefrom and even for the payment of the principal in specie in this province which has become expressly bound for the same at a fixed period to any person whatever who from the state of his private affairs would prefer such payment. In full confidence that under the present and any unforeseen circumstance your Excellency is invested with all necessary authority the representatives of the province and their constituents rely on the wisdom already experienced of your administration and in the name of the Commons of Lower Canada I have the honour to present this bill to your Excellency humbly requesting thereto his Majesty's assent. His Excellency was pleased to signify the Royal assent. His Excellency then addressed both Houses and the Provincial Parliament was prorogued to the 16th of September.  ID369,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,11,inform,As the following Speech of Gen.

WASHINGTON.  ID373,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,01,27,inform,FEDERAL LEGISLATURE. House of Representatives. Dec. 3. THE Secretary of the Senate announced that the Members of the Senate were ready to admit the Members of the House of Representatives in the Senate Chamber in order to receive the President's communication. FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Since the commencement of the term for which I have been again called into office no fit occasion has arisen for expressing to me fellow citizens at large the deep and respectful sense which I feel of the renewed testimony of public approbation. While on the one hand it awakened my gratitude for all those instances of affectionate partiality with which I have been honoured by my country; on the other it could not prevent an earnest wish for that retirement from which no private consideration should ever have torn me. But influenced by the belief that my conduct would be estimated according to its real motives; and that the people and the authorities derived from them would support exertions having nothing personal for their object I have obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the executive power; and I humbly implore that Being on whose will the fate of nations depends to crown with success our mutual endeavors for the general happiness. As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom the United States have the most extensive relations there was reason to apprehend that our intercourse with them might be interrupted and our disposition for peace drawn into question by the suspicions too often entertained by belligerent nations. It seemed therefore to be my duty to admonish our citizens of the consequences of a contraband trade and of hostile acts to any of the parties; and to obtain by a declaration of the existing legal state of things an easier admission of our right to the immunities belonging to our situation. Under these impressions the proclamation which will be laid before you was issued. In this posture of affairs both new and delicate I resolved to adopt general rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the privileges of the United States. These were reduced into a system which will be communicated to you. Although I have not thought myself at liberty to forbid the sale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of commerce with France to be brought into our ports; I have not refused to cause them to be restored when they were taken within the protection of our territory or by vessels commissioned or equipped in a warlike form within the limits of the United States. It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct improve or enforce this plan of procedure; and it will probably be found expedient to extend the legal code and the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States to many cases which though dependent on principles already recognized demand some further provisions. Where individuals shall within the United States array themselves in hostility against any of the powers at war or enter upon military expeditions or enterprizes within the jurisdiction of the United States; or where the penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been indistinctly marked or are inadequate; those offenses cannot receive too early and close an attention and require prompt and decisive remedies. Whatsoever those remedies may be they will be well administered by the judiciary who possess a long-established course of investigation effectual process and officers in the habit of executing it. In like manner as several of the courts have doubted under particular circumstances their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peace and even of a citizen of the United States although seized under a false colour of being hostile property; and have denied their power to liberate certain captures within the protection of our territory; it would seem proper to regulate their jurisdiction in these points. But if the executive is to be the resort in either of the two last mentioned cases it is hoped that he will be authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courts when for his own information he shall request it. I can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of our duties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the necessity of placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense and of exacting from them the fulfillment of their duties toward us. The United States ought not to indulge a persuasion that contrary to the order of human events they will for ever keep at a distance those painful appeals to arms with which the history of every other nation abounds. There is a rank due to the United States among nations which will be withheld if not absolutely lost by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult we must be able to repel it; If we desire to secure peace one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity it must be known that we are at all times ready for war. The documents which will be presented to you will shew the amount and kinds of arms and military stores now in our magazines and arsenals; and yet an addition even to these supplies cannot with prudence be neglected as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuring a warlike apparatus in the moment of public danger. Nor can such arrangements with such objects be exposed to the censure or jealousy of the warmest friends of Republican Government. They are incapable of abuse in the hands of the militia who ought to possess a pride in being the depository of the force of the Republic and may be trained to a degree of energy equal to every military exigency of the United States. But it is an enquiry which cannot be too solemnly pursued whether the act more effectually to provide for the national defense by establishing an uniform militia throughout the United States has organized them so as to produce their full effect; whether your own experience in the several States has not detected some imperfections in the scheme; and whether a material feature in an improvement of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity for the study of those branches of the military art which can scarcely ever be attained by practice alone. The connection of the United States with Europe has become extremely interesting. The occurrences which relate to it and have passed under the knowledge of the Executive will be exhibited to Congress in a subsequent communication. When we contemplate the war on our frontiers it may be truly affirmed that every reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissension with the Indians north of the Ohio. The instructions given to the Commissioners evince a moderation and equity; proceeding from a sincere love of peace and a liberality having no restriction but the essential interests and dignity of the United States. The attempt however of an amicable negotiation having been frustrated the troops have marched to act offensively. Although the proposed treaty did not arrest the progress of military preparation it is doubtful how far the advance of the season before good faith justified active movements may retard them during the remainder of the year. From the papers and intelligence which relate to this important subject you will determine whether the deficiency in the number of troops granted by law shall be compensated by succors of militia or additional encouragements shall be proposed to recruits. An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive for peace with the Creeks and the Cherokees. The former have been relieved with corn and with clothing and offensive measures against them prohibited during the recess of Congress. To satisfy the complaints of the latter prosecutions have been instituted for the violences committed upon them. But the papers which will be delivered to you disclose the critical footing on which we stand in regard to both those tribes; and it is with Congress to pronounce what shall be done. After they shall have provided for the present emergency it will merit their most serious labours to render tranquillity with the savages permanent by creating ties of interest. Next to a rigorous execution of justice on the violators of peace the establishment of commerce with the Indian nations in behalf of the United States is most likely to conciliate their attachment. But it ought to be conducted without fraud without extortion; with constant and plentiful supplies; with a ready market for the commodities of the Indians and a stated price for what they give in payment and receive in exchange. Individuals will not pursue such a traffic unless they be allured by the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the United States to be reimbursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the opinion of Congress they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by any means yet in the hands of the Executive. GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The commissioners charged with the settlement of the accounts between the United and Individual States concluded their important function within the limited time by law; and the balances struck in their report which will be laid before congress have been placed on the books of the Treasury. On the 1st day of June last an installment of on million of florins became payable on the loans of the United States in Holland. This was adjusted by a prolongation of the period of reimbursement in nature of a new loan at an interest of five per cent. for the term of ten years; and the expenses of this operation were a commission of three per cent. The first installment of the loan of two millions of dollars from the Bank of the United States has been paid as was directed by law. For the second it is necessary that provision be made. No pecuniary consideration is more urgent than the redemption and discharge of the public debt: On none can delay be more injurious or an economy of time more valuable. The productiveness of the public revenues hitherto has continued to equal the anticipations which were formed of it; but it is not expected to prove commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested. Some auxiliary provisions will therefore it is presumed be requisite: and it is hoped that these may be made consistently with a due regard to the convenience of ourcitizens who can not but be sensible of the true wisdom of encountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviate a future accumulation of burdens. But here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the transportation of public prints. There is no resource so firm for the government of the United States as the affections of the People guided by an enlightened policy; and to this primary good nothing can conduce more than a faithful representation of public proceedings diffused without restraint throughout the United States. An estimate of the appropriations necessary for the current service of the ensuing year and a statement of a purchase of arms and military stores made during the recess will be presented to Congress. GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The several subjects to which I have now referred open a wide range to your deliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of our common country. Permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude of your task:–Without an unprejudiced coolness the welfare of the government may be hazarded; without harmony as far as consists with freedom of sentiment its dignity may be lost.–But as the legislative proceedings of the United States will never I trust be reproached for the want of temper or of candour so shall not the public happiness languish from the want of my strenuous and warmest cooperation. GEORGE WASHINGTON. Philadelphia Dec. 3 1793 The President having withdrawn the Members of the House of Representatives returned to their Chamber where the President's Address was read and referred to a Committee to report the draft of an answer. A Committee was then appointed to report the unfinished business of the last House.–Adjourned. Thursday Dec. 5. The Journal of the Commissioners for treating with the Indians was read. It is minute and lengthy. The definitive answer of the Indians contains their reasons for rejecting the proposals of the Commissioners drawn up in a masterly manner it bears all the appearance of EUropean logic faintly clad in an Indian dress. All the documents relative to this business were referred to a Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. A message was received from the President communication sundry papers relative to our European relations and also the result of the proceedings of the Commissioners appointed to settle the accounts of the United States with the Individual States. The first set of papers is introduced by a message of which the following is a copy: United States Dec. 5 1793 GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES As the present situations of the several nations of Europe and especially of those with whom the United States have important relations cannot but render the state of things between them and us; matter of interest ing enquiry to the Legislature and may indeed give rise to deliberations to which they alone are competent I have thought it my duty to communicate them certain correspondencies which have taken place. The Representatives and Executive Bodies of France have manifested generally a friendly attachment to this country; have given advantages to our commerce and navigation and have made overtures for placing these advantages on permanent ground; a decree however of the National Assembly subjecting vessels laden with provisions to be carried into their ports and making enemy goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend contrary to our treaty though revoked at one time as to the United States has been since extended to their vessels also as has been recently stated to us. Representations on this subject will be immediately given in charge to our Minister there and the result shall be communicated to the Legislature. It is with extreme concern I have to inform you that the proceedings of the person whom they have unfortunately appointed their Minister Plenipotentiary here have breathed nothing of the friendly spirit of that nation which sent him; their tendency on the contrary has been to involve us in a war abroad; and discord and anarchy at home. So far as his acts or those of his agents have threatened our immediate commitment in the war or flagrant insult to the authority of the laws their effect has been counteracted by the ordinary cognizance of the laws and by an exertions of the powers confided to me. Where their danger was not imminent they have been born with from sentiments of regard to his nation from a sense of their friendship towards us from a conviction that they would not suffer us to remain long exposed to the action of a person who has so little respectedour mu tual dispositions and I will add from a reliance on the firmness of my fellow citizens in their principles of peace and order. In the mean time I have respected and pursued the stipulations of our treaties according to what I judge the true sense; and have withheld no act of friendship which their affairs have called for from us and which justice to others let us free to perform. I have gone further;–rather than employ force for the restitution of certain vessels which I deemed the United States bound to restore I thought it more advisable to satisfy the parties by avowing it to be my opinion that if restitution were not made it would be incumbent on the United States to make compensation. The papers now communicated will more particularly apprize you of these transactions. The vexations and spolitation understood to have been committed on our vessels and commerce by the cruizers and officers of some of the belligerent powers appeared to require attention. The proofs of these however not having been brought forward the description of citizens supposed to have suffered were notified that on furnishing them to the Executive Power due measures would be taken to obtain redress of the past and more effectual provisions against the future. Should such documents be furnished proper representations will be made thereon with a just resistance on a redress proportioned to eh exigency of the case. The BRitish Government having undertaken by orders to the commanders of their armed vessels to restrain generally our commerce in corn and other provisions to their own ports and those of their friends the instructions now communicated were immediately forwarded to our Minister at that court. In the mean time some discussionson the subject took place between him and them; these are also laid before you; and I may expect to learn the result of his special instructions in time to make it known to the legislature during their present sessions. Very early after the arrival of a British Minister here mutual explanation on the execution of the Treaty of Peace were entered into with that Minister; these are now laid before you for your information. On the subjects of mutual interest between this country and Spain negociations and conferences are now depending. The public requiring that the present state of those should be made known to the legislature in confidence only they shall be the subject of a separate and subsequent communication. G. WASHINGTON Mr. Madison reported the draft of an Answer to the Address of the President. The remainder of this sitting was employed in beginning the reading of the papers received from the President which are voluminous.
