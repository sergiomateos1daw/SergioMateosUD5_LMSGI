Just as we arrived there was a famine and it was really a shocking sight to behold; you could not move out of your house but the corpses lay in your way and the wild dogs and jackalls were eating them at noon-day. The Hindoos never bury their dead but burn them to ashes if they can afford it; if not throw them into the river. I have lately seen a man brought to the river side and laid down at lowwater mark before he was dead ; and when the the tide flowed it carried him off. If a man woman or child dies at night the corpse is eaten by the morning. This I have been an eye witness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback every morning I had an opportunity of seeing more than those that did not. In the course of six months I became so much used to it that I took no notice of it. I was there when a dreadful conflagration took place and burnt upwards of seven miles without intermission and many souls perished. Now consider first an inundation; second a famine; and third a conflagration. How much the place must be distressed I leave you to think. I left Decca the 1st of December last and arrived at Calcutta after a passage through the Sunderburns (in 17 days) hearty and well thank God.  ID13,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,08,28,inform,Extract of a letter form Philadelphia dated 25th May 1789. I have travelled through several of the States and see no appearance of the poverty which you hear so much boast of in Britain–every where I meet rather with extravagance. Indeed they procure too easily to be frugal in their out-givings. All the manufactured goods imported from Europe are from Britain and they cannot have goods equal in quality and price from any other place. I think I never say so many children as are in this country every town village and farm-house are full of them.–The people of this country increase like rabbits: It is supposed they double their numbers every fifteen years; but I should think they do it in a shorter period.–What a grand prospect for the sale of British goods for when so many hundreds of millions of acres of land lye idle to be granted or purchased at a small price the people of this country never will manufacture ; At present wages are high and 1000 acres of land in the back settlements may be purchased for as many pence?.  ID90,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,23,inform,CAPE OF GOOD HOPE. The following account of the inhabitants of this settlement is given by a late traveller. The education of youth has hitherto been very much neglected: the government never hit upon any successful plan for the establishment of public schools; and the individual had no other ambition but that of qualifying his sons by writing and accounts to become servants of the Company. This body of merchants had a number of persons in their employ who were very ill paid. Their salaries indeed were sufficient to afford them a bare subsistence ; but it ta citly allowed them to negotiate for themselves: the consequence of such a conduct was that each became a kind of petty dealer. Each had his little private shop in some corner of his house. The most paltry articles were in the list of their commodities for sale ; and those who ranked high in government and assumed a string of full-founding epithets to their names felt no sore of indignity in retailing the produce of their gardens ; not indeed avowedly but through the medium of their slaves. In fact the minds of every class the Governor the Clergy the F[?]l and the Secretary of the Court of Justice excepted were wholly bent on trade. Knopman or merchant was a title that conferred rank at the Cape to which the military even aspired. On this subject the ideas of the Dutch differ widely from those of the Chinese who have degraded the merchant into the very lowest order of their society. That portion of the day not employed in the concerns of trade is usually devoted to the gratification of the sensual appetite. Few have any taste for reading and none for the cultivation of the fine arts.–They have no kind of public amusements except occasional balls ; nor is there much social intercourse but by family parties; which usually consist of card playing or dancing. Money-matters and merchandize engross their whole conversation : yet none are opulent though many in easy circumstances. There are no beggars in the whole colony and but a few who are objects of public cha rity. The subsistence for these is derived from the interest of a fund established out of the church superfluities from alms donations and collections made after divine service and not from any tax laid upon the public. Except indeed a few colonial assessments for the repairs of the streets and public works the inhabitants of the Cape have little drawback on their profits on the produce of their labour. It has been the remark of most travellers that the ladies of the Cape are pretty lively and good humoured ; possessing little of that phlegmatic temper which is a principal trait in the national character of the Dutch. The difference in the manners and appearance of the young men and the young women in the same family is inconceivably great. The former are clumsy in their shape awkward in in their carriage and of an unsocial disposition; whilst the latter are generally of a small delicate form below the middle size of easy and unaffected manners well dressed and fond of social intercourse; an indulgence in which they are seldom restrained by their parents and which they as seldom turn to abuse. They are here indeed less dependent on and less subject to the caprice of parents than else where. Primogeniture entitles to no advantage; but all the children male and female share alike in the family property. No parent can disinherit a child without assigning on proof on at least of the fourteen reasons enumerated in the Justinian Code. By the law of the colony a community of all property both real and personal is supposed to take place on the marriage of two person unless the contrary should be particularly provided against by solemn contract made before marriage. Where no such contract exists the children on the death of either parent are entitled to that half of the joint property which was supposed to belong to the deceased and which cannot be withheld on application after they are come of age. It is but justice to the young females of the Cape to r emark that many of them have profited much more than could be expected from the limited means of education that the place affords. In the better families most of them are taught music and some have acquired a tolerable degree of execution. Many understand the French language and some have made great proficiency in the English. They are expert at the needle and all kinds of lace knotting and tambour work and in general make up their own dresses following the prevailing fashion of England brought from time to time by the female passengers bound to India from whom they may be said to Catch the manners living as they rise Neither are the other sex while boys deficient in vivacity or talent ; but for want of the means of a proper education to open their minds and excite in them a desire of knowledge they soon degenerate into the common routine of eating smoaking [sic] and sleeping. Few of the male inhabitants associate with the English except such as hold employments under the Government. This backwardness may be said to be owing in part to the different habits of the two nations and partly perhaps to the reluctance that a vanquished people must always feel in mixing with their conquerors.  ID125,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,19,inform,Irish Emigrants. New York Nov. 27. Nothing scarcely can be conceived more distressing than the situation of an unfriended stranger arrived here from across the Atlantic without the means of helping himself and without even enough of acquaintance with the men and things about him to enable him to judge what path he should take to secure him the miseries of absolute want. Such however is actually the situation of hundres who annually land on our shores. To provide for those forlorn beings several attempts have been made by associations of humane individuals here but nothing hitherto has appeared to promising as that of which an account here follows: – At a meeting of Irishmen and descendents of Irishmen held at Harmony Hall on Tuesday the 25th instant for the purpose of promoting a Settlement of Irish Emigrants; Andrew Morris Chairman WM. Sampson Secretary ; Upon the motion of Thomas Addis Emmett the circular previously issues on this subject was read by the Secretary : – Circular It is a sentiment long felt and often expressed that something should be undertaken on behald of the emigrants who flock to these shores. Without any fixed destination they remain in the sea port until beocming victims of bad counsel and bad example they lose the pure and honest energies with which they left their native land and suffer worse than shipwreck in their moral qualities. The Government of this great Republic is well aware of the advantage to be derived from so great a mass of laborious industry when usefully directed and employed–and of adding to the nation's strength men whose attachment to the institutions of this country is assured by so many ties. But it is in the order of things that some of the friends particularly the countrymen of these emigrants who have been some time established and known should come forward to attest the necessity and guarantee the solidity of the enterprise. If his has not been done sooner it is because every advance in social improvement must come in its season. it is the ripeness of the occasion and the voice of the times that now speak. It has been remarked that among the lands nows open for sale and settlement there are some tracks particularly in the Illionois territory where the Irish emigrant with the instruments to which his hands are accustomed and in a climate congenial to his habits might procure to himself immediate shelter and subsistence–and in a few years be able to repay with gratitude the benefits conferred on him. We whose names are undersigned have met to consult upon the means of promoting some establishment that might be a rallying point for the distressed and give to the wanderer a habitation and a home. We have thought of no better way than to address by this circular the friends and well wishers of Ireland who co-operation might give most weight to the measure and to submit whether it might not be advisable to join all our efforts and petition Congress early in the ensuing session for a grant of a suitable track upon a credit of 14 or 15 years subject to such conditions and modifications as the Government may see most fitting. to the Government we would offer no deceptive delusive or precarious motive rather chusing to make its wisdom benignity and patriotism the anchor of our hope. We request of our if you approve of our sentiment and of our project to advance and promote it by your best endeavours ; either by forming organized associations or by obtaining individual signatures to a petition to the effect stated. We have not yet been able to digest a plan and have rather chosen to make this humble beginning in hopes that we should soon receive additional light upon the subject from cor respondence we solicit. We shall nevertheless proceed to investigate the subject and challenge the co-operation of good and respectable men and request of you to do the same. You will please address your answers and any future correspondence to Mr James Moffit No. 15. Frankfort Street New York. Thomas Addit Emmet. Denis M'Carthy William Sampson John R. Skiddy James R. Mullaney John Meyher William James M'Neven Cornelius Heeny Matthew Carroll Robert Swanton James Moffit. New York Nov 18 1817 Mr Emmet then stated that he had been requested by the gentlemen who called this meeting to explain the objects for which it was convenued ; that it could not be necessary to expatiate before those he was now addressin on the situation of the peasantry and farmers in Ireland ; it was at present one of unqualified misetry partly occasioned by their local oppressions and partly by the general calamities of Europe ; it compelled them to fly to these shores in such numbers and under the pressure of so great poverty that the most active individual benevolevence could neither provide them with a sufficient present succour nor procure for them within a reasonable time the means of permanent settlement. The consequence was that many of those unfortunate strangers were totally lost to this county or forced by want to become noxious and dangerous to its cities whose original dispositions and qualifications if rightly directed and employed would have made them valuable and useful members of the community. Besides the accounts transmitted back to Ireland of their disappointments and destitute situations deferred many who were suffering at home the extreme of wretchedness from endeavouring to better their condition in this more fortunate and favoured land–to the political institutions of which they were also more strongly attached. A very painful reflection on these circumstances had suggested to come gentlemen then present the hope that the general Government might be induced by a strong and united application to grant a portion of its unsettled lands on terms liberal and bountiful so that an asylum might be formed for industrious and enterprising farmers who would gladly fly from famine and persecution to a spot where the sweat of their brows falling on a fertile soil would yield them a rich harvest for their own exclusive benefit and where they might peacefully enjoy all the blessings of that republication liberty they loved. The time for making such an application seemed auspicious ; party asperities had softened fown and probably few would now be led by political prejudices to give it opposition. Neither was it unprecedented ; a favour nearly similar had been granted to the French emigrants and to settlers from Switzerland. It is true we could not forth a pretence like the cultivation of the vine or the olive ; and we would not succeed by practising any delusion. We could offer nothing but an immediate accession of industrious and hardy settlers who in a congenial soil and climate would become enthusiastically attached to the country and the Government from whence they derived all their blessings and wherever they were found would form a barrier against every enemy. Much might undoubtedly be expected from the generous sympathy which the sorrows and sufferings of Ireland had everywhere excited in the United States and from the acknowledged liberality of its Constituted Authorities ; but very forcible arguments might also be addressed to its policy and interest. Not only those that in the ordinary course of events would arrive here whose usefulness is lost by the want of proper direction and who become burdens or scourges to our cities would be rescued and placed in a situation where all the energies of active and enterprising minds would be serviceable to themselves and the community ; but also the very fact that such an asylum was open and accessible would infinitely increase the amount of emigration from Ireland and people our wildernesses with incalculable rapidity. The place upon which we have fixed our eyes is in the Illinois territory–it has been lately purchased and is not yet even surveyed. In the ordinary course of events it is not likely to be brought into market (at least to any extent) for many years ; but if Congress listen to our application and grant to the settlers an extended credit Government will receive payment for the land probably as soon as if it were suffered to remain unheeded till its regular turn for sale came round. A large body of settlers will be enabled to grow rich during the time that the land would otherwise be waste and unproductive and the value of all the contiguous property belonging to the United States would be rapidly and immensely increased to say nothing of the advantages resulting from the strength of such a settled frontier. All these considerations may be strongly urged by men who can most truly say they are actuated by no views of personal speculation or emolument ; who are willing to enter into all the labour of procuring settlers and organising the establishment without any prospect of gain or even compensation except as to what may be necessary for defraying the expences of the undertaking ; and who are desirous that the actual settlers should enjoy all the advantages which Government may be willing to grant. These are our views–we conceive that they may be realized if supported by an united and active co-operation of those who think like us in other parts of the Union. We are therefore desirous of adopting and pointing out to others what seems to be the best mode of giving system to that co-operation ; namely the formation of societies totally divested of all party or political feelings and directing the attention only to this object. There are already a sufficient number of political institutions in every State in which the zealous partizan (be his opinions what they may) can act on them to their fullest extent. Let these societies be neutral groun or rather consecrated places in which when we meet we lay aside all our hostilities and join as brothers in our prayers and offerings at the shrine of our common worship. They are consecrated to every man amongst us by the purity of their object by our earliest recollections by our unbroken affection and our strongest sympathies– by the unextinguished love of our native land for which most of us have already renounced all sectarian antipathies and religious animosities ; which we offer as a solemn pledge to the country of our adoption that our hearts will be always alive from temperament as well as prin ciple to the emotions of patriotism ; and that those amongst us who have pledged their faith to her however they may seem to differ on some minor political subjects will always be found firmly ranged and united under the same banners and forming one phalanx whenever her more important interests are concerned. Mr Emmet then moved four resolutions which being severally put were carried with some slight amendments as follow :– 1. Resolved–That it is expedient to form a Society of Irishmen and descendents of Irishmen for the purpose of endeavouring to procure from Congress a track of land in the Illinois territory to be settled by emigrants from Ireland. 2. Resolved–That every person of the foregoing description who shall on or before the second day of December next pay to the Secretary of this Meeting the sum of five dollars shall be entitled to become a Member of the said Society until the number of subscribers shall have amounted to one hundred after which time the subscribers shall be at liberty to elect their own officers and no person shall afterwards be admitted except by ballot. 3. Resolved–That it be recommended in Irishmen and the descendents of Irishmen in the other cities and towns of the Union to form similar societies for the purpose of corresponding and co-operating with that which is about to be formed in this city. 4. Resolved–That as the meeting of Congress will shortly take place and in order to prevent the less of time a Committee of fifteen be appointed to prepare the outlines of a memorial to that body to be submitted to the consideration of the Society when formed and organized ; and also to adopt such measures as they may think expedient for promoting and accelebrating the organization of that Society. Mr John W. Mulligan in seconding Mr Emmet's motion expressed in handsome terms how much he was gratified by the invitation to attend had given him the opportunity of claiming his title of descendent of an Irishman. A Committee was then appointed pursuant to the fourth resolution the number being upon motion and discussion augmented to twentyone. Committee –Andrew Morris Thomas Addis Emmet William Sampson John W. Mulligan Thomas Kirk James Moffit Robert Swanton Matthew Carroll William James M'Neven Captain Skiddy Dennic M'Carthy John Meyher James M'Bride Cornelius Heeney William Paterson Colonel Mulaney David Bryson Captain O'Sullivan James J. M'Donnell Dennis H. Doyle James Hayes. A subscription paper being then opened a number of those present subscribed their names and paid five dollars as their initiation fee and became members of the association. Those persons who wish to become original members may do so by signing their names and paying their subscription to the Secretary before 2d December pursuant to the second resolution. After the meeting was adjourned the Committee organized itself and appointed Sub-Committees to report a draft of a constitution and a memorial to Congress and for the discharge of other requisite duties.  ID130,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,12,28,persuade,Our paper of Thursday last contained a general view of some of the most popular publications on the subject of emigration and we shall now endeavour briefly to make an estimate of the good and evil which is likely to befall those who embark in this hazardous adventure. There is one important fact which we gather from all the accounts of America whether written for the purpose of praise or censure namely that there is a great demand for labour and that wages are high and this effect is necessarily produced y the vast space of fertile and unoccupied territory which lies westward of the United States towards the Pacific Ocean. It is this vacant territory which is the true spring of this American community. Here is the grand outlet for the superflouous population both of the eastern states of America and of Europe. To cultivate this waste there is a constant demand for new labourers ; wages are of course high – the labourer lives in comfort and if he is industrious he becomes in his turn a purchaser of land from the savings which he accumulates. If labour should become more plentiful and wages should fall this is the signal for new emigrations ; and thus this constant demand for labour in the western districts regulates its general price throughout the United States. In these circumstrances it is clear that a labourer provided he can reach this advantageous market for his labour will unquestionably improve his condition. But herein lies the difficulty. A labourer has seldom the means of of subsistence so far beforehand as to enable him to undertake so long a journey ; and if he enters upon the enterprise with insufficient means he is liable to starve before he can transport himself to his ultimate destination or he is forced to contract for immediate subsistence obligations little short of servitude under the weight of which he is grievously oppressed. These then form strong objections to emigrations in the case of those who are stinted to their means ; but where these objections can be surmounted those who can transport their labour from the overstocked market of Europe to the understocked market of America will unquestionably dispose of it to better advantage ; but if they have not the means they may as furely fail in the attempt and draw upon themselves aggravated misery and want. As to the consequences of emigration to this country we hold them rather to be beneficial than otherwise and we cannot easily account for the very absurd alarm which has been propagated on this subject. The evil in Europe is that every country is overcrowded with labourers who cannot find employment ; and is it not manifest therefore that the withdrawing of some of these will make more room for the labourers that remain – that the loss of those useless hands will rather be a relief to the body politic and will diffuse greater soundness and vigour through all its parts? That these effects will follow from emigration in this or in any other country in Europe we cannot doubt – and that the labourer if he can afford the expence of the journey will receive higher wages in America than in this country is equally clear. There is another class of adventurers who may possibly improve their circumstances by emigration although this is not so certain namely farmers with a moderate capital. An allotment of land may be purchased in the back parts of America at the Government price of two dollars per acre and an emigrant who can afford to but and to cultivate 100 or 200 acres and acts with proper judgement and skill may undoubtedly by a speculation of this sort be sure of a subsistence while by the continued emigrations from the eastern states the country being quickly settled all around him his property is daily improving in value. But a want of judgement in the purchase or a want of ability to cultivate the land after it is purchased may involve him in irrecoverable distress and ruin ; and to avoid these hazards no little discrimination and prudence is necessary. Such are some of the most striking advantages of emigration and we shall now state some of its disadvantages. The first and chief of these is the difficulty of effecting a settlement and of subsisting until the land which is purchased yields its first produce. The country is partly open ground or prairie as it is called or it is covered with almost boundless forests. A settlement in the woods requires incredible labour to clear it – labour is dear and not easily procured and this herculean task naturally devolves on the head of the family who is forced during the day to ply the axe in this laborious drudgery of felling trees and afterwards to follow the chace for a meal to his family. Here he must frequently sleep out in the woods ; and his body exhausted with his day's labour is exposed to the cold dews of night ; under such unintermitted toil his health declines and it is obvious that his family deprived even for a single day of his exertions must be reduced to the most deplorable straits. In many parts the country which is marked out for emigrants is extremely unhealthy in particular the banks of all the navigable rivers which afford the most eligible settlements both in point of fertility and situation are exposed to the most fatal maladies. The same causes which produce fertility produce disease. The overflowing of the waters from the autumnal and spring floods fertilise the land in a most wonderful degree ; but the exhalations of these stagnant waters under a burning sun are as fatal to the health as the deposits which they leave are favourable to the soil. Hence the many minute directions which are given to all emigrants in regard to their health. In a letter contained in the Emigrant's Guide we have the following advice to those who are descending the Ohio : If the weather becomes warm guard well against the smell of bilge water. But if you must descend in the spring go early – avoid all delay and remember you are fleeing for your lives. I have seen the havoc and I believed it not till then. Again it is observed Let nothing tempt you to fish in warm weather immediately on changing your climate. The effluvia of the shores is poison. To a European emigran the climate must be of course even more fatal ; and he either therefore lose his health or he must be continually tormented with anxiously taking care of it which makes it a question whether it is worth having on such terms. Such are the hardships through which if he has strength to endure them he at length emerges into ease and independence. These hardships however will no doubt be in a great measure avoided or at least mitigated if he has beforehand provided the means of subsistence until he can derive regular supplies from his own land. In this case he is less liable to be dislodged from his situation by the casualties to which all emigrants are necessarily exposed. – He is secured against the hardships of a first settlement and is more certain of attaining the wished for object of ease and affluence – To a farmer therefore or a labourer emigration presents a fair chance of a permanent settlement provided it is gone about with ordinary caution and the necessary degree of energy be exerted to insure success. But it is a gross delusion to imagine that an elysium is to be found in the United States or that mankind exist there on any more favourable terms than in this country and those who set out on any such visionary schemes are sure to meet with a woeful disappointment. With regard to other classes of society it does not appear that they will improve their condition by emigration to America ; there is no demand for clerks or professional men of any sort and no merchant has any thing to expect by removing his capital to the United States. In the back settlements there is a demand for schoolmasters to teach the ordinary branches of education and several emigrants of this class have met with good encouragement. In regard to the essential article of comfort it is apparent from all the best information on the subject that a person long resident in this country would change for the worse by an emigration to the United States. He would in the first place suffer extremely from the climate from the extreme cold of winter and the raging heat of summer the thermometer frequently standing at 98 degrees in the share with a clear sky and broiling sun and very little abatement of this exsessive heat being experienced through the night. His frame accustomed to the more temperate though unsettled climate of this country runs the risk of being debilitated by the change and at all events he must suffer extremely in his enjoyments and in his spirit from this cause. Nor we should imagine would the manners of the people in the back parts be found very agreeable or polished. It is admitted on all hands both by those who are favourable and those who are unfavourable to the Americans that if there is not as in Europe gross ignorance and debasement on the one hand neither is there on the other any thing much exalted above the ordinary level. But the inferences which arise from this established fact are strongly in favour of Europe. The grossness of vice and ignorance carries a sure antidote to its corruptions in the disgust which it excites : such examples are not so potent to debase as examples of a different sort are to purify and exalt. There is little risk that society will be contaminated by what is low and debased ; but on the other hand there is a certainty that what is exalted and illustrious in literature science taste accomplishments or fashion will exercise a powerful influence on the general state of manners. We naturally copy what we admire and those great and shining examples constitute a standard to which the whole system of life and manners has a tacit reference. In the United States they have no such models – they do not aim at so high a standard and taste and manners are therefore necessarily at a lower ebb than in Europe – Hence all accounts agree in reprobating the extreme filthy habits which universally prevail ; and Cobbett who will be suspected of too great partiality to this country draws a contrast between the inhabitants of Hampshire and those of the United States in which he places this vice of the American manners in strong colours ; and he adds as his reason for this that they have no gentlemen's seats with the fine improvements of pleasure grounds &c. dispersed through the country as models of taste and neatness for the inferior classes and it is to the same principles that we may trace other defects in their manners namely that they have no proper models on which to form themselves. Hence excepting in the principal cities we may safely conclude from all the information we have received on the subject that society has not reach the same degree of refinement as in this country. An emigrant accustomed to live in Britain would also feel the disavantages of American society strong in this that here in so closely peopled a community surrounded with all sorts of refinements life is assisted by such a variety of helps that it glides down the smooth stream of comfort and convenience without ever meeting with a single interruption. It is astonishing to what a pitch of improvement a society is brough abounding in wealth and in all the mechanical arts and where the ingenuity of thousands is incessantly on the rack to set on foot new devices for the common good. We are not duly sensible of the advantages of this because like other advantages they are familiar to us by long habit and we begin to imagine that they are inherent in the natural constitution of things. But when we are suddenly transplanted into a new community abounding indeed in subsistence but deficient in all comforts – where only the coarsest mechanic arts are practised – where the inhabitants are so widely dispersed that their common exertions cannot be made available for the common good we find life interrupted at every turn. In our former society if we had not the previous secret of transmuting all things into gold we had at least the power of transmuting gold into every thing else. But here the power of money is limited. We must indeed pay for services but we must also beg for them ; and thus we go on fretting and tormenting ourselves under petty incommodities which in this country would be remedied as soon as they were felt. It is incon ceivable how much inconvenience and discomfort and real unhappiness may spring from this cause. In this country by long habit and pracrice and continual improvement every thing has fallen into its right place – each individual has a separate task assigned him in the joint task of labouring for the general benefit – and the industry of all however variously directed tends to one common end. There is a perfect unity of effort. We all labour in common – we combine our efforts that they may yield the largest possible produce and this produce is accurately shared among the various members of the community each receiving the share to which his labour entitles him. Such is substantially the process by which commerce diffuses the benefits of industry over every civilized community. – Money is the instrument by which this division is effected. Every one who labours has the value of his labour ascertained in money which is a draft upon the common stock for whatever quantity of necessaries and luxuries he is entitled to ; and all these complicated operations are executed with a regularity almost mechanical. But in a community newly forming there is a want of unity and combination – all the members labour indeed but no one has his proper part assigned him – there is a jostling and an interference with each other – and when they come to divide some have too much and some too little of certain articles – the stock is ill assorted and money will not execute its functions. Hence disorder arises and inconvience and awkward wants and an individual suddenly removed into this region of discomfort from the happier climate of a highly improved community must be annoyed with feeling in the highest degree gloomy and disagreeable. He must have the same sensation as a person who quits an elegant mansion fitted up with every comfort and convenience for one of inferior quality and coarsely finished where he is exposed to a thousand annoyances every minute. It is observed by Dr Johnson that the evil of life does not consist in any sudden and overwhelming crash of misery but in a series of petty discomforts amd mischiefs continually preying upon the temper. The truth of this maxim those who emigrate from this country to the back woods of America will have a good opportunity of verifying. The prevalence of slavery in most of the States of the Union constitutes another capital defect in the structure of American society. These slaves form a degraded and oppressed class and in the tyranny exercised over them they themselves are morally destroyed while the corruption extends to the other orders of society equally infecting the oppressed and the oppressor and debasing the general character and habits of the people. It is vain to talk of liberty while stain of tyranny so deeply infects the domestic manners of a community. There can be no rational liberty unless we call that liberty which gives us the privilege of torturing and oppressing our fellow creatures. To give an idea of the consequences of this dreadful evil of slavery we may state that it is a practice in Kentucky to commit delinquent slaves into the hands of the public executioner by whom they are unmercifully flogged at the markey cross of the different towns the streets being filled with their pietous cries. What can we think of the people where such spectacles are for a moment tolerated. This is so utterly revolting to every just and enlightened feeling that to a European it would form a strong objection to his permanent residence in that country. In all the northern states and in some of the new states particularly that of the Ohio slavery is indeed abolished. But in several others the black form a large proportion of the population and they are not decreasing. We know indeed that this evil is admitted in its full extent by all the American statesmen that they lament it but do not well see what measures can be adopted to check it. The importation of new slaves is indeed prohibited but the increase of those already in the country is the great grievance against which it is difficult to devise a remedy and the cruel and oppressive treatment which slaves will always meet with wherever they exist must tend to degrade the habits and moral feelings of the community at large. To such therefore as are accustomed to European society where no such strain of tyranny infects the domestic manners an exchange into a community where his feelings may be revolted by spectacles of gross cruelty cannot be regarded as very desirable. If more imperious considerations permit they have certainly a greater chance for happiness by remaining where the rights of nature are respected than by removing to a society where every principle of humanity is trampled upon.  ID134,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,01,02,persuade,In answer to the remarks which appeared in our paper on Monday last respecting emigration to America and to the statements there given of the disadvantages which emigrants from this country might expect to meet with we have received a very abusive letter from an anonymous correspondent who appears very angry and like most other angry men seems more anxious to give full vent to his wrath than to assign any good reason for it. His first cause of quarrel is that we have stated the general want of cleanliness to be a prevailing defect in the back parts of the United States. For this we have the authority of almost every traveller who has visited those parts. The remarks of Birkbeck on this point are conclu-sive and striking: – ' In viewing the Americans (he observes) and ' sketching in a rude manner as I pass along ' their striking characteristics I have seen a de' formity so general that I cannot help esteem' ing it national though I know it admits of ve' ry many individual exceptions. I have written ' it and then erased it wishing to pass it by ' but it wont do – it is the truth and to the truth ' I must adhere. Cleanliness in houses and too ' often in person is neglected to a degree which ' is very revolting to an Englishman. ' America was bred in a cabin ; this is not a ' reproach – for the origin is most honourable ; ' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn ' logs for a framed building and that again for ' a mansion of brick some of her cabin habits ' have been unconsciously retained. Many have ' already been quitted and one by one they will ' all be cleared away as I am told they are now ' in the cities of the eastern states. ' There are I believe court-houses which ' are also made us of as places of worship in ' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating ' ever since they were built. What reverence ' can be felt for the majesty of religion or of ' the laws in such styles of abomination ? The ' people who are content to assemble in them ' can scarcely respect each other. Here is a bad ' public example. It is said that to clean those ' places is the office of no one. But why is no ' person appointed ? Might it not be inferred ' that a disregard to the decencies of life prevails ' through such a community?' To the same purpose Cobbett complains of the ' general (for there are many exceptions) sloven' liness about the homsteads and particularly ' about the dwellings of labourers. Mr Birkbeck ' complains of this and indeed what a contrast ' with the homesteads and cottages which he left ' behind him near the exemplary spot Guild' ford in Surrey.' He then proceeds to give the reasons for this. When the first settlers took possession of the country the ' example of neat' ness (he observes) was wanting. There were ' no gentlemn's gardens kept as clean as ' drawing-rooms with grass as even as a car' pet. From endeavouring to imitate perfec' tion men arrive at mediocrity ; and those who ' never have seen or heard of perfection in these ' matters will naturally be slovens.' He afterwards remarks – ' The market day at Guildford is a perfect ' show of cleanliness. Not even a carter without ' even a clean smock-frock and closely shaven ' and clean washed face. Well may Mr Birkbeck ' who came from this very spot think the people ' dirty in the western country. I'll engage he ' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one ' family of his present neighbours than he left ' behind upon the skins of all the people in ' the three parishes of Guildford. However he ' would not have found this to be the case in ' Pennsylvania and especially in those parts where ' the Quakers abound ; and I am told that in ' the New England States the people are as ' cleanly and as neat as they are in England. ' The sweetest flowers when they become pu' trid stink the most and a nasty woman is the ' nastiest thing in nature.' In answer to all this our correspondent tells us that the Scotch are very dirty. This we admit was formerly and may still continue in some degree to be the reproach of the Scotch. But does this reasonable person mean to argue from this that dirty habits are amiable and ought not to be corrected. With regard to the difficulties of effecting a settlement we are borne out in our remarks on this subject by the authority of various writers and principally by the autheor of the Emigrant's Guide a work of great merit which combines an extent and precision of statistical information altogether unequally with the most enlarged general views of the state of the country both physical and moral. ' Most men (observes ' this judicious writer) on arriving in the United ' States expects too much. Perhaps the only ' essential advantages offered are the security of ' person and property and the cheapness of land. ' It demands excessive labour severe economy ' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident to ' succeed in a newly settled country ; and it de' mands the permanency of this continued la' bour prudence and favourable circumstances.' Our anonymous correspondent is also extremely displeased that we have stated so strongly the perincious effects produced on the general manners of the Americans by the existence of slavery ; and he mentions that many a labourer in this country might envy the condition of an American slave. What are those privileges for which a free man should envy a slave he does not think proper to state. To show however that we have not exaggerated the degradation and oppression of the coloured class in the United States we shall again adduce the authority of the Emigrant's Guide. The author is contradicting the notion that the labourer in the slave States is confounded with the negroe ; and he expresses himself in the following terms: – ' A residence of 16 years in places where sla' very is prevalent enables us to contradict a ' general expression that in such places whites ' performing manual labour are confounded in ' the moral estimates of the people with slaves. ' Though less respect is certainly paid to useful ' labour in the slave states than where all the ' duties are performed by whites yet ' the distance between the two races of men are ' in all cases immense. So deep profound and ' inveterate is the feeling on that subject that ' not any where in the United States can pro' perty sobriety intelligence and every other ' advantage expect colour raise in public opi' nion a man the most remotely allied to the ' African to a rank equal to the meanest white. ' Any person who resides a few years in Louisi' ana will be witness to some very remarkable ' exemplifications of this innate contempt for all ' those who affinity involve them in the con' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery.' What a picture is here conveyed of misery and degradation on the one hand and of tyranny on the other. – Here we find it failry confessed that no degree of worth whether moral or intel lectual not even the possession of property can give a man the least degree of consideration in the eyes of the privileged class. We cannot conceive a community more wretchedly constituted. All that is estimable and worthy is here utterly contemned because the individual who possesses these qualities happens to have his skin of a particular colour and thus a merely accidental quality of the corporeal frame entails upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy and contempt. These distinctions carried to such an excess seem to us to be founded on the extinction of every generous and honourable sentiment and we cannot help still asserting that we had rather live we at present are than in a community where such hateful antipathies rule to the exclusion of every just and humane feeling. With regard to the condition of the negroe slaves we shall quote a passage from Brown's Western Gazetteer or Emigrant's Directory after reading which we shall leave our anonymous correspondent to say whether he thinks the condition of a labourer in this country preferable to that of being an African slave. The writer describing the town of Lexington in Kentucky observes – ' In this square stands the market-house ' which is of brick and well furnished on Wed' nesdays and Saturdays ; but occasionally the ' scene of a barbarous practise ; for it is here ' that incorrigible or delinquent negroes are ' flogged unmercifully. I saw this punishment ' inflicted on two of these wretches. Their ' screams soon collected a numerous crowd ; I ' could not help saying to myself These cries ' are the knell of Kentucky libery.' Having made this answer to the angry charges thus brought against us we have only to disclaim in the strongest terms all hostility or prejudice against the Americans. We have no wish either to depreciate their character or institutions. They exhibit the interesting spectacle of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace to wealth and greatness. To revile such a people would be the height of human folly and equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to take offence because endeavour to make a fair estimate of their character without hiding any of its defects.  ID141,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,27,inform,Extract of a letter from William Hunt esq. To H. Hunt esq. Washington Hotel New Orleans Dec. 25. 1818. My Dear Brother – We arrived safe in the mouth of the Mississippi on the 10th of this month after a voyage of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in excellent health and very happy. There are 35 English vessels from Liverpool now here and a great many English emigrants from Yorkshire Nottinghamshire Lancashire Wiltshire Hampshire and Somersetshire ; and in fact from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a week in the river about 80 miles below New Orleans ; we all went on shore and had plenty of rabbit shooting. I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun by Knock corner of Fetter-lane. Henry myself and Mr Blake went one day into the woods to kill deer by night coming on we lost our road ; and differing in opinions we separated Henry and Mr Blake taking one road and myself the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods and did not return to us till the next morning. It being wet and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground in spite of the remonstrances of Mr Blake caught a severe cold and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days but he is now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In the river there are thousands of wild swans wild geese wild ducks woodcocks snipes and other wild fowl. If you were there you would kill a waggon load in a day as I know you have frequently killed a horse load in England ; but they are a thousand times more numerous here than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms with them and very cheap. No game certificate required here. Myself Henry Mr Blake and the other passengers visited a French farmer about six miles below New Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land whereon are sugar plantations sugar-houses & c. ; he made 250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. – They are very lazy bad managers and appear to use their negroes very cruel and work them very hard. The Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the deaths are frequently seventy in a week. The scenery of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and Staines and many of the buildings are as handsome as those of Bath. Here is one Church which is a very beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spanish shops are all open and it is a market during the whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening gambling & c. We are at the Washington Hotel the best in the city ; it is expensive although very good living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each including claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm weather as in England and it is as warm here now as it was in England in July although not half so oppressive and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the election : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel most of them English. We do not trouble ourselves about politics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday we were charged 100 dollars each for passage and four dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four quarters of the best peas rye grass seed and some more of Hill's Scots ploughs to be left at Messrs Brown and Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the Illinois. Mr Trimmer an Englishman has purchased 20000 acres of land near Mr Birkbeck and has taken twenty couple of hounds with him so that we shall have some hunting as well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought over some with me but they may follow us ; as I understand the labourers with the pay of a dollar a day can live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply and others that I have seen from Illinois report that the farmer can get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is a good sure market and a fair profit and only one penny per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to pay. Price of labour is very dear here ; we pay a dollar for washing every dozen of shirts cravats pocket handkerchiefs & c. & c. The price of a gallon of best rum is one and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things shipped from England I have paid 92 dollars for. Although I should like England very well if it was not for the taxes yet from what I have seen hitherto I like America ten times better  ID317,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,27,inform,Richmond January 28. Extract of a letter from a Gentleman now residing at Quebec to his Correspondent in this City dated Jan. 9 1972 Our humanity was deeply affected by the dreadful carnage made by the Indians. You may be assured that the number of Indians did not exceed 1000 and that nothing saved General St. Clair and the remainder of his army but the great quantity of plunder he left to the Indians; they were composed of various tribes and three-fourths of of them remained in the camp to plunder it and to take scalps the trophies of their victory; and he that got most when he returned to his nation acquired the greatest share of glory; hence only about 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is under 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they have obtained at so easy a purchase and the riches they obtained by the plunder and the provisions they found will make them a more terrible foe than ever they have been; they boast of taking an amazing quantity of powder and arms which they wanted; many of them were only armed with spears and hatchets and I have no doubt but if another expedition should be set on foot that they will be met by three times the number of Indians. The indian tribes of nations who live many hundred miles back have all entered into an association and made the present war a common concern they to oppose what they call the common enemy. The warriors of the different tribes so united are not less than 15 or 20000; numbers of the chiefs of ten or twelve numerous nations were here last summer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make peace and offered his mediations; he told them he was at peace with the United States and could give them no assistance. Their answer was that the enemy was in their country and would not make peace with them but on term dishonourable and at the expense of their country and that they had determined to die before they would accept of such terms. They felt much dissatisfied with the answer they received and departed with a full determination to defend their country with the last of their blood. You may depend on it that many years will elapse and many thousand men be expended before the United States will by the present measures be able to possess the country in contest; and I may also add that I have great apprehensions that desolation and destruction will be the consequence on the frontiers of the Ohio this winter and next spring; I would to God some steps might be taken to prevent them. I have no doubt the country might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the expence already incurred by the different expeditions; the attempt to take the country from them by force is founded in unrighteousness and ought to be abandoned; besides if the American mean to have anytrade with them they are taking steps that will prevent it for many years to come. The Indians do not easily forget or forgive injuries Carlisle Jan. 4. 1792. By the Pittsburgh post which arrived yesterday we are informed that previous to his leaving Pittsburgh an express had arrived there with the melancholy news that Forts Jefferson and Franklin were taken by Indians and that two large bodies of them were moving to the Allighany. Extract of a Letter from Patowmack North Amer ca Feb. 7. Last Sunday evening came to this town a young man from Cat-fish which he left about two weeks ago and who gave us the following pleasing interesting and important intelligence viz that two days before he left Cat-fish two men arrived there from Licking who informed that they had been out with a body of 1300 volunteers on horseback from Kentucky under General Scott; that they left Licking on the expedition a few days before Christmas; that General Scott dispatched three spies in advance who when they arrived about 13 miles beyond the spot where General St. Clair was defeated they discovered a large body of Indians diverting and enjoying themselves with the plunder they had taken riding the bullocks dancing &c. and appeared to be mostly drunk; that on the information being given to General Scott who with the main body were a few miles in the rear he divided them into three divisions advanced and fell on the enemy by surprise; that the contest was short but victorious on the side of the volunteers 700 of the enemy being killed on the spot all the cannon and stores in their possession retaken and the remainder of that savage body put to flight; that General Scott having lost but six men returned to Licking in triumph with most of the cattle stores &c. leaving the cannon at Fort Jefferson; that General Scott had previously gone out with 400 men but finding his number was insufficient was returning but met a body of 900 volunteers when upon joining him he immediately proceeded in prosecution of his original design which fortunately proved successful. Our informant further adds that he saw a Kentucky newspaper of the 8th of January at Morgan Town brought by Major Scott's expedition which corresponded with that given by the two men at Cat Fish and that Gen. Scott brought in near 700 scalps.  ID367,Glasgow Herald,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1822,01,28,inform,Extract of a letter from an Englishman dated Lima Septemper 10 1821 Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colonial town; 6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; the whites are about 1200 Europeans and not as many born in the country; the rest are blacks and mulattoes. Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty and misery than in any town of the size in the world.– There are some few splendid houses but the rest so disgustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin. The streets as in all American towns run at right angles; a powerful stream of water in each; the town is capable of great improvement. The climate must be bad for the whole population look as if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of Peru we made the same observation; the ague very general with fever–their habits and manner of living increase the evil; thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold –I sleep under a heavy blanket and could bear another; a thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter; the heat however is not excessive during summer; on the whole not an oppressive climate if the people had any idea of living in a rational way. Very few families cook at home℃they buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets in pulperias and in the squares; not six families in Lima that have wine on their tables; they drink brandy at all hours and excuse themselves for not having any thing that is expensive by saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies himself a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in the evening. Their money goes in gambling debauchery and dress; every woman high and low has her price; a lady takes no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you she is quite at good as her neighbours and needs be no better. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause of all the degradation of South America; every Viceroy from Pizarro to Pezuela was a plunderer a teacher of immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of this people seems incredible–one must see to believe it; scarcely a young lady can read or write or use a needle; few houses that the Devil has not appeared in; and a devout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves; as to priestcraft it reigns here in all its glory; a third part of Lima is covered with churches some of them very splendid. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the single mine of the mountain of Pasco for returns; if this is worked to advantage it will produce six millions of dollars; but if the country is disturbed by war not a dollar will they have. The exports of Peru in ordinary times were five millions of dollars in pecie and one million in produce. Mininng may be carried to any extent it is true; but this requires tranquillity and good government. People in Europe have the most erroneous ideas or Peru; every traveller and historian who has written or talked about it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar. Arica the second port of Peru and the great outlet to Upper Peru is a wretched village of hovels covered with mud–about 400 Mulattoes and Indians–placed on a sand bank–the people all in the ague–not a boat or ship of any sort. The harbour-master came off on bulsa (two bladders lashed together) paddled by an Indian. We could not get a basket of fruit or vegetablse for money. Their cultuvation was three leagues off but they were too lazy to fetch any thing though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to twnety hours offering them any price for their tropical fruits. I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month and sleep on the ground; borrowed a chair and bought some crockery. No such thing as a tavern; never was. Letters of no use; no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at eight o'clock to kill time. A play twice a week; the most fashionable ladies stand up in the front boxes and light a segar by the chandelier; the house filled with smoke. There are 82 titled families mostly idiots–all reduced to poverty by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war be continued a year Peru will be the most wretched country on the globe; indeed the Indians will regain their empire and exterminate all other colours. the number of blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy thousand– 25000 in Lima and adjacent village the total population of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians. About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty country houses. Provisions of all sorts excellent and in the greatest variety; fruits of all climates in the marketplace the produce of the sea-shore and the Cordillera.– Beef and mutton excellent–the chief supplies come from Janja and other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore produce is continued to little vallies badly cultivated; those about the town would disgrace the free negroes of Carolina. Most valuable land a league from the town half cultivated and half abandoned; every thing left to starved slaves; such famished objects I never beheld; no other hands to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general they will not work and famine must ensue.  ID385,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,11,27,inform,The Americans wished to give the title of Highness to General Washington a President of the Congress but the hero rejected the offer saying that the title he already held was fully equal to his ambition.
