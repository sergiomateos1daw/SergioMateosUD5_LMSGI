The Argo has arrived with a most extensive supply of tea viz 167 chests of souchong 200 ditto bobea 200 hyson skin and young hyson 50 ; in all 617 chests. The consequences has been a reduction in the price of souching from 30s to 5s per lb currency. Shortly prior to the Argo's departure from the Island of Mauritius the Hope American ship laden with tea and sundies valued at L80000 was captured by his Majesty's sloop Harpy Captain Allen. In consequences of the oppressive conduct of several masters of colonial and British ships and of their crews towards the natives of New Zealand of Otaheite and of the other islands in the South Pacific Ocean which have led to the destruction of several vessels with their crews by the natives and disturbed all trade and intercourse with those islands both by British shipping and that ofthe allied powers–his Excellency has forbidden any vessel to clear out from any place in New South Wales without a bond given by the master or owner to the naval officer for the time being at the port for L.1000 sterling binding him and his crew not to commit any act of hostility or to be guilty of any trespass or forment any animosities between the natives or take any part in any war that may prevail ; nor forcibly carry away any male or female inhabitants of the islands under penalty of forfeiting the sum specified in the bond. A small party who a short time ago undertook[?] a land passage in a direction towards Broken Bay for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and fertility of the country have discovered an excellent grazing track of 8000acres. In consequence of which one gentlemen Mr Robert Campbell has already sent thither an extensive herd of cattle and this example is likely to be followed by others. Thomas West who came to this colony a convict for life in the ship Earl Cornwall's[?] in 1801 has received from his Excellency a conditional pardon in consideration of his general good conduct and character for sobriety and industry and also in consideration of his having lately erected a water mill for the grinding of grain at Barcorn Glen within two miles of Sydney being the first water mill ever erected in the vicinty of this town. Sydney New South Wales May 21. The good understanding between the natives and our settlers which had been maintained for the last six years has given place to frequent outrages attended with fatal consequences. On Saturday a body of 60 natives commenced plundering the fields of a settler when three privates of the veteran battalion fired upon them and killed a boy. The narushed upon them before they could load again and killed on private Isaac Eustace and compelled the other two to fly. They then plundered the ground of Messrs Milehouse and Butcher. Next day a party of 14 soldiers falling in with them shot a woman and two children–the savages attacked William Baker a stock-keeper of Mr MacArthur killed the man and two women named Sullivan and Herburg. Sydney New South Wales Feb. 12.

(From the Sydney Gazette Nov. 8. 1815) By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler and part of the crew of the Indian brig Matilda which sailed from this colony in August 1813 bound on a voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands and from thence to China but was cut off and plundered on the night of the 10th of April last while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay at the Island of Rooapoah one of the Marquesas on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted and joining with some of the Rooapoah natives took the opportunity of a dark night and the wind blowing fresh right on the land to cut the vessel adrift by which means she drove on shore through a heavy surf and was soon bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat they concurred universally in the design of putting the whole of her crew to death; which appears to have been a constant practise among the different natives towards one another when their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore through stress of weather or from any other accident. Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their chief or king Nooahetu who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld his assent to the murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of the vessel– The crew were informed by such expressions as they could understand as well as by gesticulations that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion that their lives were dependent on the issue; the good chief was opposed to many other chiefs who though somewhat inferior in rank were very far superior in number supported by the common usages of the island from which the exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated with his son by his side on a mat in his own dwelling; he had been called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish of the people as it was not a hereditary right but an elective dignity. His people pressed their solicitations earnestly and at length peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length of time opposed by the force of words which not seeming likely to prevail he adopted a method which silenced the whole in an instant and saved the lives of Capt. Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his expostulations were defeated on the principle of undeviating custom he deliberately took up two ropes that were near him and fixing one round the neck of his son and the other round his own called to the chief next in command who immediately approached him. His conference was short and decisive: he first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of his son and then to the other which he had entwined around his own. These strangers are doomed to death said he by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit that I who am their King should live to see so vile a deed perpetrated. Let my child and myself be strangled before it is performed and then it never will be said that we sanctioned even with our eye-sight the destruction of these unoffending people. The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce even in the mind of the unenlightened savage a paroxysm of surprise mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which the untaught man may possibly excel his fellow - creature whose conceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly upon their king whose person they adored because that his principles were good and his government just and mild. They saw the obedient chief to whom the order of strangulation had been imparted staring with horror and amazement at the change which a few moments had produced; The mandate which had proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed; and commanded to perform the dreadful office he proceeded to obey when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance.

Six of the adverse party were killed and devoured by the rebels while Captain Fowler was among them and the following de testable circumstance occurred on the occasion: A native man belonging to Port Anna Maria who was not tattooed and in consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh on pain of death impatient of the restraint fell upon one of the murdered bodies and darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a voracious fury exhaled the crimson moisture which had not yet coagulated. The chief of Port Anna Maria who is very friendly to Europeans is named Ke-atta-nooe the first part of the name implying the outrigger of a canoe and the latter signifying great. The dress of the men consists merely of a wrapper about the waist; the women are covered from the shoulders downwards to the ancles and are generally fairer than the Taheitan women. The chiefs have no distinguishing mark or ornament but in the mode of wearing their hair; which the common orders wear tied up in a large knot on each side of the head a stripe of which extending from the forehead to the hollow of the neck is kept shorn which practice the chiefs do not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the worms to be more prevalent and destructive to the ship's bottoms there than he has any where else witnessed; and to this cause attributes the caution of the natives in drawing up their largest canoes some of which contain from 80 to 100 warriors.

[From the Sydney Gazette November 8 1815] By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler and part of the crew of the India brig Matilda which sailed from this colony in August 1813 bound on a voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands and from thence to China; but was cut off and plundered on the night of the 10th of April last while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay at the Island of Rooapoah one of the Marquesas on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted and joining with some of the Rooapoah natives took the opportunity of a dark night and the wind blowing fresh right on the land to cut the vessel adrift; by which means she drove ashore through a heavy surf and was soon bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat they concurred universally in the design of putting the whole of her crew to death; which appears to have been a constant practise among the different natives towards one another when their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore through stress of weather or from any other accident. Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their Chief or King Nooahetu who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld his assent to the murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of the vessel. The crew were informed by such expressions as they could understand as well as by gesticulations that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion that their lives were dependent on the issue; the good Chief was opposed by many other Chiefs who though somewhat inferior in rank were very far superior in number supported by the common usages of the island from which the exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated with his son by his side on a mat in his own dwelling; he had been called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish of the people as it was not an hereditary right but an elective dignity. His people pressed their solicitations earnestly and at length peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length of time opposed by the force of words; which not seeming likely to prevail he adopted a method which silenced the whole in an instant and saved the lives of Captain Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his expostulations were defeated upon the principle of undeviating custom he deliberately took up two ropes that were near him and fixing one round the neck of his son and the other round his own called to the Chief next in command who immediately approached him. His conference was short and decisive; he first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of his son and then to the other which he had entwined round his own. These strangers are doomed to death said he by my chiefs and my people and it is not fit that I who am their King should live to see so vile a deed perpetrated. Let my child and myself be strangled before it is performed; and then it never will be said that we sanctioned even with our eye-sight the destruction of these unoffending people. The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce even in the mind of the unenlightened savage a paroxysm of surprise mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which the untaught man may possibly excel his fellow-creature–whose conceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly upon their King whose person they adored because that his principles were good and his government just and mild. They saw the obedient Chief to whom the order of strangulation had been imparted staring with horror and amazement at the change which a few moments had produced; the mandate that had proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed; and commanded to perform the dreadful office he proceeded to obey–when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. The King! the King! from every lip burst forth– What! kill the King! No no let all the strangers live –no man shall kill the King! Thus were their lives preserved–and the vessel plundered of every thing on board her. The floor of the Greenwich which was burnt at Nooaheva still remains and is dry at low water. All her iron and copper have been taken out by the natives who have a thorough knowledge of the use of these materials. That they are cannibals is well ascertained. They form distinct factions and make war upon the ruling Chief–the rebels are denominated the Typees; and the opposite parties are horribly sanguinary towards each. Six of the adverse party were killed and devoured by the rebels while Captain Fowler was among them and the following detestable circumstance occurred on the occasion:– A native man belonging to Port Anna Maria who was not tattooed and in consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh on pain of death impatient of the restraint fell upon one of the murdered bodies and darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a voracious fury exhaled the crimson moisture which had not yet coagulated. The Chief of Port Anna Maria who is very friendly to Europeans is named Ke-atta-nooe the first part of the name implying the outrigger of a canoe and the latter signifying great. The dress of the men consists merely of a wrapper about the waist; the women are covered from the shoulders downwards to the ancles and are generally fairer than the Taheitan women. The Chiefs have no distinguishing mark or ornament but in the mode of wearing their hair; which the common orders wear tied up in a large knot on each side of the head a stripe of which extending from the forehead to the hollow of the neck is kept shorn which practice the Chiefs do not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the worms to be more prevalent and destructive to the ships' bottoms there than he has anywhere else witnessed; and to this cause attributes the caution of the natives in drawing up their largest canoes some of which contain from 80 to 100 warriors.
