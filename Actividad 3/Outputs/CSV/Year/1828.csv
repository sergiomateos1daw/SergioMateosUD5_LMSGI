        ID207,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1828,05,07,entertain,Love in a Prison. –We have all heard that Love rules the court the camp the grove but we have rarely heard that the little god delighted to dwell in prisoned solitude ; true it is and of verity nevertheless that he seems if not to have fixed his dwelling in at least to be a very constant visitor of our jail. It is not long since a couple who had imbided the tender passion were linked in the bonds of matrimony in it ; and a like consumnation most devoutly to be wished for by another pair of inmates would ere now have taken place did not envious bolts and bars intervene for a petition has been presented by two delinquents of different sexes both under sentence of transportation to the Magistrates praying that they may be allowed to marry before setting out for New South Wales. The fond pair never saw each other till inclosed in the same vehicle on their way to stand trial at last Perth Circuit for capital offences ; yet in this situation love–omnipotent love–took the captives captive and rendered them in its enjoyment even in their perilous plight o'er a' the ills o' life victorious. But alas! the course of true love never did run smooth; and no less a personage than the Secretary of State for the Home Department has in this case crossed the path of the hapless couple and doomed them to single blessedness for many a year by ordering the fair penitent to be removed to Penitentiary at Millbank for seven years instead of transportation for fourteen ; leaving the forlorn lover to seek consolation in the charms of some sterling or currency damsel in the land of promise to which he must now wend his solitary way.– Fife Hld. ,law;marriage;transportation
        ID208,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1828,06,25,inform,House of Commons.–June 19. The Speaker took the Chair at a few minutes before four o'clock and was shortly afterwards summoned by the Deputy Usher of the Black Rod to attend the House of Lords. The Speaker stated on his return that the Royal Assent had been given by Commission to several public and private bills. Mr C. Dundas presented a petition from Newbury in the county of Berks praying for the abolition of slavery in the West Indies. Mr Planta moved for a new writ for the election of a member to serve in Parliament in the room of Lord Leveson Gower who had accepted the office of ChiefSecretary for Ireland.–Ordered. Ale-House Licensing Bill. On the motion of Mr Estcourt the house resolved itself into a committee on this bill. On the clause that no brewer who should himself supply public houses with beer should be allowed to act or assist as a Magistrate at any meeting or session for the granting of licenses Mr Bernal moved that this clause be struck out altogether. Mr R. Gordon supported the clause. Mr Monck thought this the most valuable clause in the bill and that it was no infringemnt but a salutary interference with the jurisdiction of borough magistrates. Strangers were ordered to withdraw and the committee divided when there were–Ayes 46–Noes 53– Majority against the clause 7. Several amendments verbal and otherwise were then agreed to amongst which was the omission of the words Cinque Ports thus excluding that class of places from the operation of the bill. On the clause being proposed relative to the hours during which public houses should be kept open on Sundays. Mr Estcourt said the original clause was to the effect that public-houses should be closed during the hours of morning and afternoon's divine service but he thought it would be better not to permit publicans to allow drinking or tippling on their premises till after the usual hour of the conclusion of morning service (one o'clock.) After a conversation in which several hon. members participated the clause was agreed to. Several other clauses having been then read and agreed to the house resumed ; the report was brought up ordered to be taken into further consideration on Monday next and printed. The Usury Laws. Mr P. Thompson moved the second reading of the usury laws amendment bill. Mr Davenport said he should oppose the bill as he considered it to be highly injurious both to the landed and commercial interests. The hon. members moved an amendment that the bill be read a second time that day three months. The question on th amendment having been put The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested the propriety of postponing this bill until the next session of parliament. He made this suggestion from no unfriendly feeling towards the bill but merely because this was not he conceived the most convenient time to consider it. The subject ought to be fully considered with a view to get rid of evils that existed without interfering with long-continued prejudices. If the discussion were postponed he would give the subject the best attention in his ( hear.) Mr Heathcote approved of the suggestion of the right hon. gentleman and wished the discussion on the question to be postponed till the next session of parliament. Mr L. Foster thought that between the total repeal or the continued existence of the Usury Laws in their present shape a middle course might be steered. Of the bill before the house he thought that under the guise of a simple enactment it covered one of the greatest illusion ever held forth to Parliament or the country for he was convinced that it would effect as complete and as practicable a repeal of the usury laws as could be proposed. It became necessary therefore to consider the probable operation of that repeal upon all the great interest of the country. The bill might give relief to few but would bring injury to many. Lord Palmerston thought the house indebted to the hon. member for Dover for bringing in the bill. It might be possible to form a bill better than that of the hon. member but his bill was better than the present law and as such he should vote for it. The gallery was then cleared and the house divided when there appeared for the second reading–Ayes 52; Noes 40 : majority in favour of the second reading 12. Voters' Registration Bill. Lord Nugent moved the second reading of the voters' registration bill and said that his object in carrying it through the present stage was that the bill might be committed pro forma for the purpose of having certain amendment introduced into it. It would then be printed with its amendments in order that the house and the country might have the opportunity of considering its details between this and the next session of Parliament. Sir R. Wilson moved as an amendment that the bill might be read a second time that day six months. Mr H. Gurney seconded the amendment. The question was then put on the amendment which was agreed to and the bill was ordered to be read a second time this day six months. Salmon Fisheries Preservation Bill. On the motion of the Chancellor of Exche- quer the house resolved itself into a committee on the salmon fisheries preservation bill. Mr Ferguson proposed the insertion of a clause exempting from the operation of the bill the salmon fisheries in the River and Bay of Thurso in the county of Caithness which are the exclusive property of Sir John Sinclair. After some conversation the gallery was cleared and the committee divided when the clause was lost. The bill having passed through the committee the report was ordered to be received this day. The other orders were then disposed of and the house adjourned at half-past two o'clock. Friday June 20. Sir G. Murray took the oaths and his seat on his re-election for the county of Perth. A number of petitions were presented against the continuance of Negreo Slavery. Irish Currency. Sir G. Hill presented a petition from the Chamber of Commerce of the city of Londonderry praying that the bill for amending the laws relating to Banks in Ireland might not be allowed to make further progress for the present. The petition was laid on the table. Sir A. Chichester presented a petition from Belfast praying a reduction of the duty on coals in Ireland which was laid upon the table. Scotch Gaols' Bill. The Lord Advocate in moving that this bill be read a second time and printed observed that it was not his intention to press it further during the present Session. No man could however deny that the object of the Bill was of great importance and he proposed therefore to have its provisions made generally known throughout the country in order that it might be again presented to the house in as perfect a shape as possible. The bill was then read a second time and ordered to be printed. Committee of Supply. In the committee of supply a number of grants of minor importance were agreed to. Sir H. Hardinge said he had another resolution to propose but it was in which he expected that a reduction would be made next year. It was that a sum of L283199 8s 1d be granted for the expenses of the disembodied? militia of the united kingdom. Mr Spring Rice said that within the last twelve years there had been two millions and a half expended on this body and that the subject was one which few gentlemen took the trouble to look at. He begged to say a word upon the Irish militia. There the whole of the staff which was larger than that of England was without a private man. Nothing could a more outrageous job than that of the milita in Ireland. The colonels kept the whole patronage of the regiment and kept up the bands for the amusemen of themselves and friends. The militia might have been of service at one time in Ireland ; but since that time the present effective police had been established and quite superseded it. He trusted Ministers would not suffer this to remain if they really wished to be economical and curtail if not abolish it. The Chancellor of the Exchequer begged to assure his hon. friend that he wanted no prompting to make any economical reduction. When however a plan for the reduction of the staff was ready and it was in contemplation it would be laid before Parliament and he should then be the friend of the definite and limited powers to which he had alluded. Mr Hume said the militia had been defended as though the country were in hourly danger of invasion –as if the country could be taken by surprise. If that were so he would gladly learn of what use were the spies who cost us L450000 a-year. We had ambassadors–they were very little better than spies–at an expense of L45000a-year ; and if their cautious observance were not sufficient to save the country from sudden invasion he knew no better means and he certainly knew no other advantage which ambassadors and consuls could be of. New South Wales Bill–Committee. On the order of the day having been read for the house resolving itself into committee on the New South Wales bill. Mr Huskisson moved that the Speaker do leave the chair. Sir J. Mackintosh said the object of his present motion of which he had previously given notice was to propose two instruction to the committee on the bill which the right hon. gentleman (Mr Huskisson) had introduced–first to the effect that the committee should recommend the introduction of a clause for the establishment of a trial by jury in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land; and secondly that it should recommend that a clause be introduced providing for the election of one-third of the Legislative Council from among persons enjoying an income of L100 a year and having been free inhabitants of the colonies for the space? of three years. The best local authories in favour of his proposition. Among these he might mention the names of Governor Hunter Governor Bligh Mr Bent the Judge Advocate Governor Macquarrie and his successor Sir Thomas Brisbane who had gone out to the colony prejudiced against the introduction into it of these institutions ; but after two years careful investigation of the subject wrote home in Oct. 1825 stating that there was now no longer any doubt about its perfect ripeness for them.–( Hear hear.)– The partial introduction of English institutions into immediate practise was the only pledge of a real intention on the part of government to introduce them more completely in the end. The right hon. gent. concluded by moving that instruction be given to the committee to recommend the introduction of Trial by Jury into the colony and to allow the inhabitants a voice in the legislative councils. Mr Huskisson said in the bill which he had introduced it was intended to extend the privilege to the government of the country of granting trial by jury in all civil cases. His right hon. friend would find if he examined that the foundation would be laid of granting the inhabitants of that colony a share in managing their own concerns. At present the legislature proposed by way of a first step to appoint a legislative committee for the purpose of watching and controuling every measure of the state. All trials should be public under the inspection of a free press and a population jealous of their rights. They should now be prepared in the course of a few years for the regular introduction of a legislative assembly ; not had he any fears when such a change should take place that it would lead to any political convulsion. Mr Hume had every reason to believe that if instead of inflicting a military governemtn they would introduce a portion of representation and the privileges of British subjects into New South Wales it would be the most flourishing of the colonies. Mr Horace Twiss said the knowledge of one fact might obviate the necessity for one at least of the right hon. gent.'s propsitions namely that the governor of the colony had the power of extending to the colonists the right of trial by jury if he should deem it expedient. Sir James Mackintosh here intimated that he should not press his amendments. They were accordingly negatived. The house then resolved itself into the Committee when several verbal amendments were proposed and agreed to. The bill then went through the committee and the report with the amendments was ordered to be brought up on Monday. The other orders of the day were then disposed of and the house adjourned at half-past two o'clock. ,alcohol;colonial government
        ID209,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1828,08,09,inform,Bervic. –There has been raised this season on the high lands of the farm of Hallgreen belonging to Mr Blair a few acres of Rib-grass a native plant of New South Wales. It was imported to this country two years ago by a man who had served his time in Van Dieman's Land. Its? favourite soil seems to be high land or muir country and is so rapid in growth that it appears not only to choke but to extirpate? every weed with which it comes in contact. It is said to be the best plant in the world both for feeding cattle and for producing mik from cows of the best and richest quality. Were the propiertors and tenants of the Highland country to follow the enterprising conduct of Mr Blair we would soon see their hills covering with a truly useful plant instead of the useless heath with at present even at best only adorns them. ,botany
