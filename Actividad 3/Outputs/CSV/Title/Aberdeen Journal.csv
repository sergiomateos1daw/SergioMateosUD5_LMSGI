        ID120,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1816,12,16,inform,Canada Lord Selkirk We have been favoured by a Gentleman in this city with the following interesting and authentic communication on the subject of the dispute between Lord Selkirk and the Gentlemen of the North West Company: Extract of a Letter from Montreal dated 6th October 1816. In the newspapers which I sent you you will see some accounts of the disturbances which have taken place in the North West between the North West Company and Lord Selkirk's colonists. The latter have been obliged to leave the Red River after having had 22 of their men including Governor Semple killed by a party of half-breeds the spurious offspring of the North West Company. As yet have not had an accurate statement of that melancholy transaction. Lord Selkirk's party state that these half-breed with some of the North West Com pany servants came to destroy the settlement and that Mr Semple with about 25 of the Colonists went out to meet them to know what could be their intentions when those rascals commenced firing on them and massacred all but three who were fortunate enough to make their escape. The North West people's account is that these half-breeds with some Indians were bringing down provisions from the upper part of the Red River to the entrance near Lake Winipie and as the Colonists had the command of a great part of the river they were obliged to pass in the rear of the settlement which being observed by Governor Semple who was on the look-out for them he settled out of his Fort with 25 men and a ?-piece to take from the Indians the provisions which were intended for the North West Company ; that the result? was an engagement which terminated in the defeat of the Colonists of whom twenty-two were killed. Lord Selkirk ? from Montreal for the Red River about the latter end of June when? three or four officers and about 150 men of De Men?'s regiment which had been disbanded and when he arrived at Fort William on Lake Superior hearing the fate of his Colonists he? immediately issued a warrant against Mr M'Gillivray for high treason conspiracy and murder and subsequently warrants against all the partners of the N. W. Company who were at F William ? formal possession of their establishment there and sent Mr M'Gillivray with about ten others prisoners to Montreal with all their papers ? a number of packs of Beaver and other Furs and several bales? of Merchandise which he found in possession of the North West Company belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company. The Police Officers in Montreal were several days examining the papers and about four or five days after the arrival of Mr M'Gillivray and the others they were admitted to bail to appear to take their trial at the next criminal court or any court of Oyer and Terminer which may be appointed. Stuart (the ci-de vant Solicitor-General who was dismissed by Sir James Craig and at whose instance an ineffectual attempt was lately made by some misguided members of our House of Assembly to impeach Chief Justices Sewell and Monk) is one of Lord Selkirk's counsel and spoke at great length and what his friends and admirers call very eloquently strongly opposed their being admitted to bail but all would not do and they were accordingly bailed ; Mr M'Gillivray in sureties of t1000 and the others in t500 sums inconsiderable enough advering to the high crimes and misdemeanours with which they were charged. In the Montreal Herald you will see a very learned and (as our neighbour Jonathan would say) a lengthy communication signed Montius? setting forth the rights which the Hudson's Bay Company by their charter possess over the Countries which they have granted to Lord Selkirk and the power vested in him of appointing Governors and other Officers to superintend and regulate the Colony. Being a masterly production it will no doubt makes its appearance in a pamphlet and when it does I shall send you one in case the papers should miscarry. It is uncertain whether the Earl will remain in the North West during the winter or come down to Montreal ; if the latter he must be down? soon? as the season for water-travelling will shortly close. Montreal is now divided into two parties one favouring the Lord and the other the North West Company ; and with the exception of the friends of the latter strongly in favour of his Lordship. ,Native Americans;military;rebellion
        ID126,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,28,inform,Canada Extract of a letter from a Mercantile House in Nova Scotia to their Correspondents in this quarter. We sincerely hope that the Duties Government had in contemplation (last year) to impose upon Timber imported into Great Britain and Ireland from the British North American Provinces equal to the additional duty imposed on Foreign Timber in 1813 will be further suspended. Our? commercial system chiefly depends upon the encouragement of the Timber branch ; ships that carry away that article? bring us ? at a low freight whereby we are enabled to furnish the British West India Islands with an abundant supply of Fish? and that on very moderate terms ; but in the event of Government persisting in imposing the Duty on Timber from hence that branch of our trade will inevitably revert to the Americans besides being the ruin of many in this and in the neighbouring Provinces. The supposed revenue that would accrue to the mother country upon trial will be found delusive ; to prove this many obvious? reasons can be adduced : As the trade now exists all the Timber extracted from these Colonies to Great Britain and Ireland is paid for in British Manufactures ; the export of so bulky an article as Timber and the import of so ponderous an article as ? employs? an immense number of British ships ; objects certainly of more real value to the revenue of Britain than any benefit they could possibly derive from direct Duties imposed on the export of Timber from British North America. It cannot be denied that previous to 1813 when the additional Duty was laid on Foreign Timber they (the Foreigners) were not only the carriers but would not accept an ounce of British Manufacture in payment for their TImber–no nothing but you gold? which was so much in demand that 28s. was given for a ?. Another very cogent reason ? be advanced in favour of what is commonly denominated the Timber Trade from these Provinces ; it facilitates emigration and introduces many valuable settlers into this Province and the Canadas that would go to the States of America ; and the day is perhaps not so far distant when they would of accessity? become our enemies. When Great Britain was first involved in war with the eastern countries from whence the principal supply of Timber was derived the merchants in that line? as well as the ship-masters were not only alarmed but convinced themselves ruined ! The Baltic is shut? what shall we do for Timber and with our ships? They properly concluded that perhaps the British Provinces could supply them ; they made the experiment they were not disappointed–but succeeded far beyond their expectations. If therefore in time of war Britain has took to her colonies for a supply of such a necessary article as Wood ; it is not reasonable for us to conclude that their interests will not be wholly neglected when blessed with peace. Extract of a Letter dated Savannah 25th Nov. 1817 In the Southern States this autumn has been the most fatal they have experienced since their colonization. Many thousands have been hurried off to that narrow house destined for all that live. A most malignant fever has prevailed to an alarming extent. In this city during the last four months the deaths have been equal to one-eights of the inhabitants left in it ; and in Beaufort (S. Carolina) and in some of the Southern Counties the morality has exceeded one-sixth! ,timber trade;international trade;manufacturing;emigration and immigration;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;weather;disease
        ID133,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,10,13,inform,Colonial Intelligence Death of The Duke of Richmond. By the Henry arrived in the rive from Quebec we have advices from thence of the 4th September three days later than the last accounts. They confirm we regret to say the intelligence received at Lloyd's on Friday of the death of the Duke of Richmond at Montreal where he had arrived on his return from inspecting the new settlements in Upper Canada. His body had been brought from Montreal to Quebec where it was lying in state at the time the Henry sail ed. His daughter Lady Mary Lennox continued in the most afflicting state and great fears were entertained for her recovery. Lady Sarah Lennoc his Grace's second daughter is married to Major-General Sir Peregrine Maitland. They accompanied his grace to North America and have remained there since he entered upon his Government. His Grace was the lineal descendant of the first Duke of Richmond natural son of King Charles II. by a French Lady who was created by his Majesty Duchess of Portsmouth and by Louis the Fourteenth Duchess of Aubigny in France. His titles were Duke of Richmond Early of March (English honours) ; Duke of Aubigny (French Honour) ; Duke of Lennox Early of Darnley and Baron Methuen of Torbulton (Scots Honours). The title of Aubigny was confirmed in March 1816 by Louis XVIII by causing the estate of Aubigny to be assigned to him and granting him the honours of the Louvre as enjoyed by his Grace's ancestors. He was a Lieutenant-General in the army Colonel of the 35th regiment of foot Gonervor of Plymouth Governor of Upper and Lower Canada and their dependencies Lord Lieutenant of the county of Sussex and High Steward of Chichester. –His Grace was born in 1764 succeeded his uncle Charles the late Duke in 1806 and married in 1783 Charlotte daughter of Duke of Gordon by whom he had issue seven sons and seven daughters all of them now living except his third son Henry Adam R. N. who fell overboard the Blake as she was sailing into Port Mahon in 1812 and was drowned. His Grace was distinguished early in life by a duel with His Royal Highness the Duke of York. He was of an open candid generous temper and of plain and unaffected manners qualities which were particularly conspicuous in Ireland when Viceroy of that country. His Grace is succeeded in the Peerage his eldest son Charles Earl of March now Duke of Richmond. This young Nobleman in the army has seen much active service under the personal auspices of the illustrious Wellington being one of his Grace's Aides-de-camp and was one of the Representatives in Parliament for the City of Chichester which seat of course becomes vacant. He was lately married to the eldest daughter of the Marquis of Anglesea and has issue a Son now Earl of March. The following is extracted from the Quebec papers: Quebec Thursday Sept. 2. This Province has again been visited by one of those afflicting dispensations of Providence which by separating by the hand of death the ruler from the people covers whole communities with mourning. An express arrived here yesterday morning from Montreal with the afflicting intelligence chief that his Grace the Duke of Richmond Governor in Chief of these Provinces had died on his way from Kingston to Montreal at the moment that he was hourly expected to join his family there from which he had separated in good health at Kingston one the 20th to complete by visiting the new Settlements the long and arduous journey in which he has been engaged. This melancholy and utterly unexpected intelligence spread with the greatest rapidity and impressed a deep gloom throughout the city. The flag on the citadel and on all the vessels in the port was hoisted half-mast exhibiting every where the signals of public mourning. His Grace's body immediately after his death was conveyed to Montreal. It reached this city last evening in the steam-boat Malsham and was removed this forenoon to the Castle with the usual military honours and followed by his Grace's Staff the principal Civil and Military Officers in the City and Garrison and a great concourse of mourning inhabitants. September 5. His Grace's remains were conveyed from Montreal to Quebec in a steam-boat. At ten o'clock one the morning of the 2d of Sept. they were removed from the vessel and placed upon a hearse upon the King's Wharf at Quebec from whence it was conveyed to the Chateau of St. Louis where they lay in state until four o'clock on Saturday the 4th September when they were removed to the place of internment in the Cathedral Church at Quebec. On the corpse being brought out the collar and insignia of the Order of the Garter with his Grace's military and other appointments being placed on the coffin the whole of the troops presented arms. On its being placed on the hearse the troops rested on their arms reversed. The procession then moved forward. It was composed of all the principals persons attached to the public military and civil departments. The military band filed off at the door of the Cathedral Church-yard and conducted it up the centre aisle when it was played on a platform the mourners remaining by the body. A signal was then given when the body was deposited – 15 guns being fired. Extract of a letter dated Quebec Sept 5 :– When I wrote the first side I did not expect so soon to communicate the melancholy event of the death of our Governor the Duke of Richmond who was attacked on his route from Upper Canada with symptoms of hydrophobia which terminated his mortal career at six miles from the settlement of Richmond. He was perfectly sensible of his situation and gave himself up from the first spasm which attacked : it was occasioned by a bite of a tame fox at Sorel on his way to Upper Canada about three months since. His death at this juncture is looked on as very unfortuante for this country as he possessed the entire confidence of Government and was about completing a plan of defence for the Canadas which when executed would establish a water communication with our extreme points perfectly free from interruption in case of a war with the States. We are happy to learn further that no part of his Grace's family was so dangerously ill as was at first reported. They are only in that situation which might be expected from so severe an affliction. Colonel Wilson had succeeded the late Duke of Richmond as Governor-General of both Canadas being the senior Officer on that station. Sir Charles Saxton and Major M'Leod Aides-deCamp to his Grace the Duke of Richmond have gone to Lake Winnipeg clothed with special powers to investigate the causes of the unhappy dissentions which are said to have been lately renewed in that quarter between the North West and Hudson's Bay Company. By the new act regulating the commercial intercourse between the province of Upper Canada and the United States the duties on the importation of manufactures and provisions from the States are considerably reduced on ? of the enumerated articles although on nails snuff manufactured tobacco and spirits they are riased. The ad-valorem? duty is reduced from 10 to 5 per cent. Buffalo Aug. 4. On Friday came? on before the Court of King's Beach at Niagara the trial of Robert Gourlay Esq. for a misdemeanour in not obeying the orders of the Magistrates at Niagara in December last. Mr Gourlay was found guilty and banished the province. From the Quebec Gazette of 26th August: This morning about 9 o'clock Lieut. Birch of the royal navy put a period to his existence by shooting himself through the head. We are informed that Mr Birch had for sometime previous to his death laboured under a melancholy state of mind. An amiable? wife and one child are the survivors? of this awful ? The Annual Report of the Agricultural Society of Quebec has been published from which it is evident that a laudable spirit of enterprise has been awakened in that important country. The Committee who in the execution of their functions travelled through the greater part of Lower Canada conclude their Report by putting on record a testimony they justly conceive to be honourable to the character of the inhabitants of the country through which they passed. Although many hundreds of persons from all parts of their respective Counties attended the Agricultural Meetings which were frequently of four or five hours duration there did not occur at any of them a single instance of intoxication disorderly conduct or personal altercation. The Grand Jury at Nassau New Providence have brought in a bill against Sir Gregor M'Gregor charging him with aiding and abetting piracy by issuing commissions in the Bahamas to subjects of Power in unity? with Spain. A letter from Sierra Leone dated the 9th of March says– It is with the deepest regret I inform you that notwithstanding the liberality of Great Britain and the faith of Treaties the coasts swarms with slave vessels dragging thousnads of its miserable inhabitants into endless captivity. A few days ago arrived here the Union of Liverpool : the Supercargo states that during his stay in the river Calabia not less than eight vessels averaging 500 slaves each had sailed for the Spanish Colonies. We have received Gibraltar Chronicles to the 10th ult. from which we learn that in consequence of the rapid increase of the fever at the Isle de Leon his Excellency Governor Don had issued a Proclamation on the 2d ult. announcing that all communications with Spain (except through the customary process of quatine) would close at sun-set on the following evening. Notice was also given to such of the labouring classes as had not passed the fever that they would be provided with tents and encamped on the neutral ground for their better security against infection should it unhappily appears in the fortress. They would not be suffered to proceed to town and follow their callings during the day but heir return to the encampment at night was peremptorily enjoined. We are happy to learn however by the latest advices from the British fortress that the garrison and inhabitants were not at all infected with the disease. ,undefined
        ID135,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,01,20,inform,Colonial Intelligence York (U.C.) Nov 4. Lord Selkirk vs. North West Company. On Friday the 30th of October the Court of Oyer and Terminer proceeded to try the gentlemen accused as necessaries to the murder of Robert Semple Esq. and others at Red River on the 19th of June 1816 and the trial was rendered extremely interesting by the disclousure which took place of many extraordinary circumstances connected with the Hudson's Bya and North West Companies which for some time past has excited so much of the public attention in this Province. The gentlemen tried on this occasion were Messrs. Alexander Mackenzie Hugh M'Gillis Simon Fraser John Macdonald and John M'Laughlin } accused as accessories after the fact. and Mr John Severlight accused as an accessory before and after the fact. It appeared in evidence that the North West Company had been upwards of thirty years in possession of trading posts called forts at different points on the Red River in the Indian Territories and it is well known that for a century before the North West Company the Canadian for traders had been in the constant practise of resorting to that country which was visited for the first time by traders of the Hudson's Bay Company about twenty-five years ago. It was put in evidence that for many years afterwards both companies carried on their trade to Red River without interference in each others pursuits and without any disturbance in the country ; and it was explained that the principal object of the trade being to collect provisions (enlisting chiefly of the dried flesh of the buffalo which abound in the plains) and the country producing abundance for the supply of both parties the same causes of dissention did not exist as at trading stations where the fine furs are obtained in small quantities and where rival traders would at all times be likely to dispute about the divisions of them. The Red River country therefore remained quiet and undisturbed until the arrival of the Earl of Selkirk's Colonists and Servants and the attempts made by their leaders to prevent the usual supplies of provisions from being obtained by the traders. The proclamation of Miles Macdonnell the soi-disant Governor of Ossinibour prohibiting the exportation of provisions from Red River was the first document produced for the defence at the recent trials. It was proved that under this assumed authority several acts of violence were committed by Mr Macdonnell and his followers. Trading posts and buildings were forcibly entered depots of provisions seized the river (the only outlet from the country) blockaded by batteries mounted with cannon and the trade of the North West Company wholly interdicted before any acts of retaliation were attempted on their part and even before they took any precautions for their own defence or for ensuring the safety of their provisions on which depended the existence of their trade and the lives of their people. Mutual and continual acts of aggression and retaliation appeared to have exasperated the minds of both parties and to have rendered them so suspicious of the designs of each other as to be always on their guard and prepared for defence. In short it appeared in evidence that the country remained in a state of private war which at length ended in the battle of the loch of Jane 1816. The particulars of this unfortunate affray were fully investigated in the trial of Bouche and Brown for murder as principals. The statements on both sides are already before the public and the acquittal of the prisoners shows sufficiently that the jury considered Mr Semple and his party to have been the assailants. On the trial of the alleged accessories the cirumstances which led to the meeting of the hostile parties were made out in the evidence to the following effect viz : – In March 1816 Mr Colin Robertson with an armed party acting under the orders of Governor Semple who had succeeded Governor Miles Macdonnell at Red River captured by surprise the North West trading post at the forks of the river called Fort Gibraltar and took possession of all the stores and provisions. In the latter part of the following month of May Governor Semple caused the buildings (which were of wood) to be taken to pieces and the materials were floated fown the river in rafts to be used in constructing his new fort which he called Fort Douglas and where (following the examples of his predecessors) he mounted cannon to command the passage of the river built an armed schooner or gun-boat to com plete the blockage and effectually to intercept the provisions and trade of the North West Company. Mr. Alexander Macdonnell a partner of the North West Company who had charge of their provisions at Riviere Qui Appele one of the branches of the Red River became alarmed at these measures of hostility and assembled as many people as he could (half breeds and others) for the protection of the property under his care with which at the usual time he proceeded down the river till he arrived within sixty miles of Governor Semple's fort. He then landed his provisions made dispositions to defend them if attacked and sent a party of his people with a temporary supply to meet the canoes from below apprise them of the blockages and concert with them the means of eluding or removing it. This party under the direction of Cuthbert Grant (a half breed and a clerk of the N. West Company) was ordered to land above Fort Douglas in order to keep out of the reach of the cannon and to carry these provisions in carts at as great a distance as possible from the fort so as to avoid being seen.– This it was fully proved they did ; but a swamp in the rear of the fort compelled them to pass within about two miles of it and being deserted and pursued from then the conflict ensued in which Mr Semple and most of his party were killed. It was further made out in evidence that in the Spring of the year 1816 the agent of the North West Company at Montreal were still in need of more than the usual supply of provisions from the Red River because there had not yet been time to replace the vessels on the lakes and the other means of transport which the Americans had destroyed during the war nor to replenish their stores at Fort William with the usual quantity of provisions from Canada. Having also heard of the seizure of one of their posts at Red River in the fall of the year 1815 and apprehending further aggressions in the spring Mr M'Leod one of the agents with all the partners and clerks who could be spared from Montreal proceeded up the country early in the Spring and on arriving at Fort William received intelligence of the capture of Fort Gibraltar and the blockade of Red River towards which place he immediately proceeded with as many of the partners clerks and servants of the Company as he could collect by the way in order to rescue the intercepted provisions in the defence of which or in their own defence if fired on by Semple's blockading battery it was their avowed purpose to use force if necessary but it was distinctly proved that their intentions and orders issued to their cannonmen were to pass Fort Douglas singing and to proceed up the river for their provisions without landing or molesting any one unless they should be attacked.–They arrived at Red River three days after the battle and Mr M'Leod who was a Magistrate being of opinion that Mr Semple's party had been the assailants and that the half breeds had only acted in self defence did not adopt any measures against them (the half breeds) but on the contrary expressed approbation for their having defended their provisions and gave them the supplies of clothing &c. usually given to all the servants of the North West Company while at the same time he arrest some of the survivors of Mr Semple's party and served subpoenas upon others to give evidence of these transactions in the Courts of Lower Canada. This was the whole of the evidence and the only circumstances which appeared relative to the prisoners were that Mr Sevewright (the alleged accessory before the fact) was with Mr Alexander Macdonnell when he sent off Grant and his party to escort the provisions past Fort Douglas and that the alleged accessaries after the fact arrived at Red River with Mr M'Leod after the battle was over and appeared to consider it as it is now found to have been an affray in which the unsuccessful party were to blame and in which the successful party were not murderers –The Judge who presided at the trial declared in his charge to the jury that there was not a scintilla of evidence against any one of these gentlemen and the jury accordinagly returned a verdict of Not Guilty. It will be recollected that these gentlemen were arrested by the Earl of Selkirk at Fort William in Aug 1815 on the charges of High Treason and Conspiracy as well as Murder–and that the buildings and property of the North West Company at that place were forcibly seized and subsequently retained by an armed force under his Lordship's command. The North West Company represented at the time that these accusations were merely a pretext set up to palliate the preconcerted plunder of their property and destruction of their trade while on the part of Lord Selkirk it was alleged that the crimes committed by the partners of the North West Company were so atrocious as to justify his Lordship's proceedings against them ; and for some time the public opinion remained in suspense as to the real merits of the case. So far as regarded the seizure of property and the interruption of trade the point was decided by the Prince Regent's Proclamation of the 3rd of May 1817 in consequence of which the North West Company recovered possession of their property and re-established their trade ; but that proclamation left the rights of parties and the crimes alleged against the individuals to be investigated and decided upon by the law – and until such investigation could take place much uncertainty necessarily prevailed from the contradictory statements and affidavits which had been laid before the public. The recent trials at York however decided the point as to the alleged murders and the charge of High Treason has never been followed up nor ever mentioned since it served the desired purpose by figuring in Lord Selkirk's Warrant as a pretext for seizing and examining the books and private papers of of the North West Company. ,undefined

The meeting then adjourned. York Upper Canada Feb. 6. Tex v. The Earl of Selkirk and others A bill of indictment for a conspiracy to ruin the trade of the North West Company and impoverish the partnes thereof was found by the Grand Jury against Thomas Douglas Early of Selkirk ; J. B. Chevalier de Lorimer Captain in his Majesty's Indian Department ; Captain Pratais D'Orsonnens late of the De Meuron Regiment ; Captain Frederick Matthey ditto ; Lieutenant G. A. Fauche ditto ; Lieutenant Frederick Graffenrad ditto ; Serjeant Jacob Vichie ditto ; Captain Miles Macdonnel late of the Canadian Fecibles ; Lieutenant Alexander Bridport Beecher late of the Royal Navy ; Doctor John Allen John Spencer Donald Macpherson James Chatelain John M'Nab Archibald Macdonald and John P. Bourke. The indictment contains three counts ; and amongst the numerous overt acts therein set forth supported by documentary and oral evidence the following were particularly prominent :– The engaging and armind a number of disbanded soldiers (foreigners) ; the entry of them by force of arms into Fort William in August 1816 ; retaining possession of the fort till May 1817 ; sending off as prisoners the partners of the North West Company found there ; getting rid of the clerks by subpoenas to appear at York at a period when no courts are held there without ever inquiring whether they know anything of the matters to which the subpoenas related and without ever bringing them forward afterwards ; stopping of the outfits from going into the interior and the returns from coming into Montreal ; possessing themselves of all the books and papers of the concern ; sending away the principal clerk under a charge of felony without examination and without having ever followed up the charge ; the pretended sale by Daniel Mackenzie of the North West property obtained by his Lordship by means of continued duress ; tampering with and debauching the North West Company's servants and commanding them in the King's name ; writing circular letters to the partners and clerks in the interior country advising them to abandon their trust alleging that the North West Company were ruined and to carry the furs to Hudson's Bay ; taking possession of Fort Lake La Pluie and the property there and stopping the navigation &c &c. Upon this being returned a true bill the AttorneyGeneral moved the process of the Court against the parties ; and Dr Allen being present was to be arraigned the following day. Wm Smith v. The Earl of Selkirk This was a civil action brough by Mr Wm Smith against Lord Selkirk for false imprisonment. It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was undersheriff of the Western District and as such the bearer of a writ of restitution founded upon a verdict of a special jury at Sandwich in October 1816 and granted by the Magistrate ordering the restoration of Fort William to the North West Company. He was also the bearer of a warrant for felony issued against his Lordship Dr Allen Captain Matthey and others upon an information upon oath before a justice of the Peace. Mr Smith got to Fort William on the 19th of March 1817 and produced his writ of restitution with which his Lordship refused to comply ; and when the Earl and others were arrested by Mr Smith upon the warrant for felony his Lordship laid hold of him and pushed him out of doors ; and he was afterwards kept in close custody in the fort under a military guard. A circumstance which added much to the grievous nature of the offence and which was particularly dwelt upon by the Judge in his charge to the Jury was that whilst Mr Smith was kept in a rigorous confinement Charles de Reinhard though under an accusation of was at large and keeping a school though nominally under the surveillance of one or two of his former comrades. The Chief Justice also remarked upon another part of the evidence for the defence by which it appeared that the only option left to Mr Smith to obtain his liberty was that of abandoning his duty and breaking his oath of office by a promise not to molest Lord Selkirk. Mr Smith however notwithstanding this proposal persisted in doing his duty and was not liberated until the evacuation of Fort William by his Lordship and his forces in May 1818. The Jury after some deliberation returned a verdict in favour of the plaintiff.– Damages L.500 Halifax currency. After narrating the military parages &c. at Richmond in America in honour of the 22d of February a journal says A melancholy catastrophe closed the day. Colonel W. Tatham so well known in England and this country for his acquaintance with civil engineering.–who has been residing in this city for two or three years but whose utility was considerably arrested by an unfortunate habit to which he had become addicted–was destined on that day to breathe his last.– In a moment of intemperance as he stood by the piece of artillery which was firing the evening salute he exclaimed that he wished to die. As the second gun was about to fire and immediately after the commanding had given the word Fire! Conolonel Tatham presented himself in front of the muzzle of the piece and by its discharge his abdomen was almost literally blown to pieces. His body was raised a few feet in the air by the explosion and he fell upon his face without uttering one word that was heard by the byestanders.– Colonel Tatham died without any family. Circumstances had strip life of much of its attractions in his eyes ; but it is impossible not to regard the manner of his death with horroer and to feel the deepest commiseraton for his melancholy fate. He was a man of great information of great genius and of great resource of mine. But to this melancholy end he has arrived. ,meeting;obituary;banking

Sir Peregrine Maitland had summoned the Parliament of Upper Canada to meet him at York on the 22d of April. He had appointed Port Talbot in the town of Dunwich a port of entry in the same manner as those established between Canada and the United Statess. Extract of a letter to a Gentleman in George-town dated Tobago Feb. 9. 1819.–' The heavy rains which continued during the months of December and January almost inundated the country which brought on a most rapid and fatal disease which made its first appearance in the frost at a short distance from the town consisting of 212 men strong and in 10 or 12 days 45 of that number were numbered with the dead. The contagion was so rapid that it soon spread into the town shipping and country and proved equally fatal. The disorder was such it baffled all medical aid. The alarming symptoms were such that business was nearly suspended–the white population seeking safety in other islands or in the remote and healthiest part of this. I assure you that every thing had a most gloomy appearance ; and the disease was so contagious one man would hardly venture to touch another. The William's crew from their mutinous disposition deserted her–some have since died ; and some remain sick. The weather has become good within these fifteen days and the health of the island improving fast.' A series of Sierra Leone Gazettes to the 20th of February have reached us. They contain no intelligence of particular interest expect that the colony appears to have been healthy at that period. In one of them we find a contradiction of the reports which found their way into the English papers some months since of the dreadful mortality that prevailed in that settlement. It states that the total number of Europeans who died in the Peninsula in 1818 was eight men three women and two children. We lost no civil military or colonial officer excepting one young Gentleman who died a month after his arrival and is included in the number. A letter from the Havannah dated 27th February mentions that the article of coffee is gradually rising in value and that an agent from Messrs Baring is making purchases there to the amount of 1/3 a million sterling in that single commodity. ,colonial politics;weather;disease;disease

Great inconvenience was experienced for the want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not this been the case it was believed that in a very few days tranquility would have been restored. We are sorry to state that another hurricane has taken place in the Isle of France ; it commenced on the 25th January and has done great mischief to the shipping and also to the plantations of that ill-fated Island. A Dutch mail has arrived with papers to the 19th inst. At Batavia two of the leaders of the late disturbances have been tried and execute and that degree of tranquility which terror produces has been restored. In the administration of their colonies in the east the conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and oppressive ; and it is to be regretted that the extensive and fertile island of Java should have been surrendered to their rapacity. During the short time that it was in possession of this country various important improvements were introduced into its domestic administration ; the practise of torture according to the humane and enlightened maxims of British jurisprudence was abolished ; new and better modes of collecting the revenue were adopted ; and a spirit of mildness and of regard for the interests of all the various classes of which the population is composed was evinced which made the British Government highly popular. Considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants for the safety of the Queen Charlotte Jamaica packet. She sailed from Jamaica the 29th March and had a great quantity of specie on board. No things have since been received of her. Several vessels sailed since her departure and have arrived safe. The Ocean quitted Jamaica on the 6th of April and arrived here several days since. Several passengers landed at Portsmouth on Thursday from Jamaica bring Port Royal Papers to the 25th of March.

General Maitland assured them he would not depart without adopting measures in their favour and immediately issued a proclamation appointing a commission of payment. Sir Frederick Adam fills the office of High Commissioner ad interim during the absence of the Governor. Advices from Demerara are received to the 3d ult. The following is from the Guiana Chronicle of the 24th May:– We observe by St Vincent: papers which we have just received that the Royal York Rangers under the command of Colonel Smelt had embarked on board the Diadem and Elizabeth transports for Canada where the regiment is intended to be disbanded. It is stated that each of the men will have a certain portion of land allotted them in that province for cultivation and their future support. We have received Newfoundland Papers to the 23d ult by which we learn that in the Court of Session on the 18th idem Capt.

This production is of the same stamp as him other lucubrations abounding with strong and vigorous assertions in place of facts–a well wove sophistry to beguile the superficial reader ; and some of the most egregious errors in colonial policy recommended with a speciousness well calculated to deceive. Having so often stated out dissent from the political proceeding of this reformer it would be deemed intrusive by many of our readers to enter into a refutation of the tenets or an exposure of the absurdities contained in his address. By others we might be supposed as exalting over a prostrate foe. Both imputations we utterly disclaim ; while as men we regret that the mad career pursued by Mr Gourlay has deprived society of the benefits which might have been reaped from his better talents (of which he doubtless has a share) we must as good subjects feel happy that his career has been checked without any bad consequences to society. The following is the present distribution of the forces in the West Indies:– 2d Regiment (or Queen's) –Demerara. 4th Ditto–Head-quarters Grenada five companies; Trinidad three companies ; and Tobago two companies. 5th Ditto–Head-quarters Antigua five companies ; St. Christopher's four companies ; Montserrat one company. 9th Ditto–Head-quarters St Vincent's five companies ; Dominica three companies ; St Lucia two companies. 21st Ditto (Fusileers)–Barbadoes. 1st West India Regiment–Head-quarters Barbadoes six companies ; St Lucia one company ; Dominica two companies ; Antigua one company. 3rd Ditto–Head-quarters Trinidad five companies till further orders.

London 1819. The sufferings to which many individuals have been exposed who have emigrated to his Majesty's foreign possessions unconnected and unprovided with any capital or even the means of support having been very afflicting to themselves and equally burdensome to the colonies to which they have proceeded the Government have determined to confine the application of the money recently voted by Address in the House of Commons to those persons who possessing the means will engage to carry out at the least ten ablebodied individuals above 18 years of age with or without families the Government always reserving to itself the right of selecting from the several offers made to them those which may prove upon examination to be most eligible. In order to give some security to the Government that the persons undertaking to make these establishments have the means of doing so every person engaging to take out the above-mentioned number of persons or families shall deposit at the rate of 10l. (to be repaid as hereinafter mentioned) for every family so taken out provided that the family does not consist of more than one man one woman and two children under 14 years of age. All children ahove the number of two must be paid for in addition to the deposit above-mentioned in the proportion of 5l. for every person between the ages of 14 and 18. In consideration of this deposit a passage shall be provided at the expence of Government for the settlers who shall be victualled from the time of their embarkation until the time of their landing in the Colony. A grant of land under the conditions hereafter specified shall be made to him at the rate of 100 acres for every such person or family whom he so takes out ; one-third of the sum advanced to Government on the outset shall be repaid on landing when the victualling at the expense of the Government shall cease. A further proportion of one-third shall be repaid as soon as it shall be certified to the Governor of the Colony that the settlers under the direction of the person taking them out are actually located upon the lands assigned to them ; and the remainder at the expiration of three months from the date of their location. If any parishes in which there may be a redundancy of population shall unite in selecting an intelligent individual to proceed to the Cape with settlers under his direction not less in number and of the description above-mentioned and shall advance money in the proportion above-mentioned the Government will grant land to such an individual at the rate of 100 acres for every head of a family leaving the parish at liberty to make such conditions with the individual or the settlers as may be calculated to prevent the parish becoming again chargeable with the maintenance of such settlers in the event of their return to this country. But no offers of this kind will be accepted unless it shall be clear that the persons proposing to become settlers shall have distinctly given their consent and that the head of each family is not infirm or incapable of work. It is further proposed that in any case in which one hundred families proceed together and apply for leave to carry out with them a minister of their own persuasion Government will upon their being actually located assign a salary to the minister whom they may have selected to accompany them if he shall be approved by the Secretary of State. The lands will be granted at a quit rent to be fixed which rent however will be remitted for the first 10 years ; and at the expiration of three years (during which the party and a number of families in the proportion of 1 for every 100 acres must have resided on the estate) the land shall be measured at the expense of Government and the holder shall obtain without fee his title thereto on a perpetual quit rent not exceeding? in any case of 2l. sterling for every 100 acres subject however to this clause? beyond the usual reservations*–that the land shall become forfeited to Government in case the party shall abandone the estate or not bring it into the cultivator within a given number of years. I am Your most obedient servant. * The usual reservations are the right of the Crown to mines of precious stones of gold and silver and to make such roads as may be necessary for the convenience of the Colony. There are already three extensive settlements on the South East Coast of Africa where the finest wheat is produced with little labour namely Algoa Bay St. Catherine's Bay and the new settlement on the Knysua a considerable river which is navigable for large vessels to the Northward. There are also extensive and fertile lands towards Saldanha Bay. As the produce from the new colonists will consist of grain and as the markets of the Cape of Good Hope the Isle of France Brazils &c. will in all probability be soon overstocked the settlers will look to the mother country for a market when an unfavourable harvest renders the import necessary ; and in anticipation of this event the merchants interested in the Cape trade intend we understand to make an application to Government respecting the Corn Laws to put the corn from the Cape of Good Hope on the same footing as grain from the British North American colonies. ,undefined

The corn districts were in a great measure cleared of the savages and the country-people were returning to their homes where they considered themselves secure from any further attacks at least for some time to come. Letters have just been received via Calcutta from New South Walves up to the end of November. The colony was then all well and several convict-ships (the Marley Glory Mario Isabella and others) had arrived having made the passage out direct in the short period of three months and twenty days and landed all their convicts and passengers in good health. This may be considered as another among many proofs that it is unnecessary to make any stay at any intermediate port. Extract of a letter from Sierra Leone dated January 9 It is with the deepest regret I inform you that notwithstanding the liberality of Great Britain and the faith of treaties solemnly entered into this coast swarms with slave vessels drugging thousands of its miserable inhabitants into endless captivity. A few days ago arrived here the Union of Liverpool : the supercargo states that during his stay in the River Calaba not less than eight vessels averaging 500 slaves each had sailed for the Spanish Collective. Montreal May 11 We learn there are about 70 souls mostly Canadians preparing to set out from this place the 25th inst. for Lord Selkirk's settlement on the River Rouge. The number of settlers there at this time it is said amount to about 590. An intelligent Canadian in easy circumstances with whom we conversed and who goes thither with the before-mentioned settlers with all his family says he passed a winter there when engaged in this for trade and reports it to be a fertile country and the climate much milder than that of Canada. Thus there is every appearance that this Colony in the course of time will become populous and flourishing. ,undefined

Captain Critchelly of the alliance arriv-? ed at Liverpool from Carbonear in Newfoundland ? which he left on the 22d ult. states that a fire broke out in an uninhabited house in St. John's between one and two o'clock in the morning of the 18th of June and that from the inflammable nature of the house? and more particularly of their roofs it spread with such rapidity that in the short space of three hours 170 fa-? milies were burnt out besides an immense quantity of produce consumed in various stores and warehouses. We learn from another account that the fire destroyed the whole of the old part of the town. It broke out near Conder and Tracy's store and burnt all between that and Messrs Baine Johnson and Co.'s. Cape of Good Hope At the present moment under the prospect of emigration all intelligence coming from this quarter is of peculiar interest. The letters which reached town ? Tuesday mention that the Caffres had commenced ? tilities anew and that their numbers were very considerable. Cape Town May 5. The Caffres have broken out and a very serious war is carried on at present on the borders. It is said that the savages are to the amount of 50000 and a detachment of 6000 attacked Graham's Town on Saturday week about 12 o'clock in the day but were repulsed and 150 left dead on the fiel. They carried off 500 wounded. Orders have been issued in every district of the colony for the young boors to inrol themselves to oppose the enemy. Cape Town May 16. The 13th regiment commanded by Colonel Wilshire have come up with the main body of Caffres near Graham's Town and have defeated them with great loss. Since then they have withdrawn from the British territory. The 54th regiment arrived at ? place a few days ago from England and have since? marched off for the frontiers. A large number of infantry have been mounted on horseback to ? them to pursue more effectually the savages. They are all in excellent spirits. It is reported that our present Governor is going home and that another has been appointed. Jamaica Papers to the 10th ultimo has reached us which confirms the sad accounts of the miserable fate of the followers of the fugitive M'Gregor. It appears that the schooner Marsha? had brought accounts from San Blas? that M'Gregor after his disgraceful flight from Porto Bello proceeded? in the brig Hero for St. Andreas where he arrived on the 7th of May and left on the 12th having suffered considerably from the effects of his leap. He promulgated a story that he had been betrayed by some of his Officers who had ? Porto Bello ; but added he would soon receive reinforcements from England when he would retake it. The Blossom arrived on Sunday from the South American station last from Rio Janeiro whence she sailed on the 8th of June. She landed about two millions of dollars at Rio Janeiro from Litna? and brought to England about 140000 on merchants' account. She and the Andromache Captain Shirreff having ? treasure on board passed Lord Cochrane's squadron in the South Seas but his Lordship did not discover even the slightest intention of interrupting either of the ships. His Lordship's squadron appeared in excellent order ; and it is but justice to his Lordship to state that he has not resorted to any undue or improper means to man his ships ; but on the contrary in every instance of complaint made to him by the masters of merchant shipping of any of their crew having deserted to him he ordered the men to be again instantly sent on board their respective ships. ,undefined
        ID153,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,09,22,persuade,Emigration to the Cape of Good Hope. (From Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.) The Chancellor of the Exchequer has submitted to Parliament the expediency of voting t50000 towards the encouragement of emigration to the Cape of Good Hope. Let it be remembered once for all that it is not because that colony is too thin of inhabitants but that the mother country is too full that this plan is suggested. The question is not how you maintain a surplus peasantry in the land that gave them birth but whether you will stop emigration to the frozen shores of Canada and to the United States or divert and encourage it to the finest colony in the world – We surely have learnt enough of North America to convince us of the degraded and miserable conditions of its people. South African on the other hand has every advantage to repay the sacrifice of quitting the land of our forefathers. The more fully to understand and appreciate these advantages we shall set before our readers a short view of the conditions and facilities of the colony in question. The spring from September to December is the most agreedable season. The summer from December to March is often intensely hot. The autumn from March to June is generally fine and pleasant. The winter is rainy and stormy and for the most part so cold as to make fires very comfortable during the months of July August and September. Most of the diseases that appear among the natives proceed rather from their gross and indolent modes of living than the unheathliness of the climate. The scarcity of water in summer is unfavourable to cultivation ; and for want of industry or materials this defect is not remedied as it is in India by artificial tanks or reservoirs. Whenever however irrigation can be employed either from wells or rivers the most abundant vegetation ensues. Good and abundant water has always been found by digging wells in Cape Town and the vicinity. In the whole colony there is scarcely a river that can be called navigable. Though swollen into torrents during the winter most of them dry up during the summer. All the rivers are well stocked with perch eels and small turtle ; and with a certain distance from the coast they abound with the several fish peculiar to these seas. There is general want of wood in South Africa – At the distance however of 1.5 miles from Algoa bay there is a large forest of a many thousand acres. Some of these trees (taxus elongatus) grow to the amazing size of 10 feet in diameter and to the height of 30 or 40 feet of trunk clear of branches. The wood is useful for many purposes but will not bear exposure to weather. The iron-wood grows to the size of 3 feet in diameter and the trunk straight and very high – The Hassayni wood is a beautiful tree... The Constantia wine is known throughout Europe and to what perfection the other wines of the colony are capable of being brought may very fairly be augured for the great improvement that has already taken place in its manufacture. Heretofore the Dutch farmer and the merchant have regarded more the quantity than the quality of their wine. And when a cargo was once shipped it mattered little to them whether sound or sour it reached its destination. Little care was taken in the growth of the vine ; the branches were permitted to rest upon the groun ; while decayed and unripe grapes stalks and leaves were all promiscuously thrown in the wine-press. The mode also of seasoning the casks with brimstone and the want of good brandy to fit it for foreign markets have all contributed to deteriorate the character and confine the sale of Cape Madeira. These defects have lately been in a great measure remedied. Proper persons have been sent out from Madeira and this country and every care seems now taken to meet and secure the growing demand in European markets. The trifling duty affixed to Cape Madeira in this country has been the means of introducing it into many families which have hitherto used home-made wines. And though the merchants at Madeira have made many remonstrances on this preference it surely is but equitable that encouragement should be given to the stape export of a colony now decidely and we must trust unalterably English. But in addition to wines there are other articles of colonial growth exported to the East Indies Europe and America. Grain wool bides and skins whale oil and bone dried fruits salt provisions soap and candles aloes tobacco. Such are the articles of commerce that might be turned to the best account. – But neither trade nor prosperit of any kind will continue to thrive in this colony under the present mode of administering its government and laws. It has been said that despotism would be the best of governments were the despot virtuous. This may be ; but contituted as human nature is we fear that the purest amongst us needs some control. Control however there is none over the governor at the Cape. He makes and annuls laws at pleasure. He inserts a proclamation in the Cape Gazette and from that moment his fiat becomes the law of the land. He has indeed an adviser in the colonial secretary whose influence does not extend beyond that of mere advice. Strange to add the laws at the Cape are at this moment Dutch laws rescinded and obscured by all the edicts of the different governors of the colony. All pleadings are in writing and were till laterly carried on foribus clausis. In 1797 a court of appeal for criminal and civil cases was established over both of which the governor presides. In India in the West Indies and in Canada there is a governor and a council. These act as checks upon each other. But at the Cape there is no appeal beyond the governor. The taxes however at the Cape under which we groan so painfully in this country are comparatively trifling. European luxuries very justly pay a heavy import duty but their purchase is matter of choice.– This falls not upon the poor not consequently will it fall upon those most likely to emigrate under the provisions of the Parliamentary grant. Noting indeed can be framed with greater care and precautions than the encouragement bedd out in Mr Vansittuart's proposal. A small deposit L. 10. is to be made at the colonial office in Downing Street by each individual. A free passage is to be granted and on reaching the Cape this deposit is to be returned to the settler by the local government. And such is the liberality that has guided the proposed plans it is moreover stipulated that if 100 families should agree to emigrate and their minister with them not only permission will be granted them so to do but provision will be made for him. The separation from country and from kindred is thus softened and it will allay many a sorrowing regret and painful recollection that in distant lands and amongst a strange people the settler may still listen to the voice and instruction of a pastor to whom custom veneration and affection have all united to attach him. It appears that the experiment of a settlement of English has already been made upon a limited plan at Saldanha Bay (the finest harbour in South Africa) : and with such success as to give the best encouragement to a more extensive emigration. Indeed from what we have outselves seen of the colony and its great facilities we have no doubt whatever of the benefits that must arise to the sober steady exertions of the industrious. At the Cape or elsewhere poverty and misery will attend the vicious and indolent but certain we are that there is no country under heaven where the poor may find a safer asylum and where activity economy and good conduct will meet with so certain and full a reward. During the stay of the 93rd regiment of foot (a Scotch regiment) at the Cape many of the privates were known to save the whole of their pay and were thus enabled to return to England with a very hand some little fortune. English servants of all descriptions are in great request and 1.5 sterling a month are no uncommon wages for a tolerable cook. It is nevertheless to beremember that clothes of all kinds are expensive at the Cape as no manufactory is permitted lest it should injure the trade of this country. Still farmers in the country dress very coarsely and cheaply ; and their wives and daughters except on Sunday are humbly clad as themselves. Indeed in so soft a climate as the Cape there is that occasion for multiplicity and warmth of apparel which colder regions require. For three-fourths of the year the best bed is a hard mattress with a single coverlet. There is point which we cannot pass over ; as we think it very intimately connected with the virtue and happiness of the settlers. And that is the education of their children. Nothing is more neglected than this in Southern Africa. The boors (farmers) are ignorant to a degree passing credence. With the minister that is to accompany 100 families it would be highly expedient to send a few sober intelligent men as schoolmasters. Attempts have been lately made to introduce into the colony the Madras system of instruction and a free school upon that plan has been established at Cape Town with considerable success. Still the natives are stubbornly averse to instruction. Their luxurious and bountiful climate supplies them with all the necessaries of human life and beyond this they have neither wish nor ambition. But if knowledge has its fruits ignorance has its weeds. The savage and unparalleled cruelties that have heretofore been exercised towards their slaves and the Hottentot servants by these Dutch boors may very fairly be traced to want of education as a main cause. The unjust limits shown by the Dutch laws to the white man's barbarities have doubtless encouraged their perpetration – Cruelty is not the character of Englishmen and therefore too much care cannot be taken to guard the families of the new settlers against the contagion of the inhumanities that they must see practised around them and how far an early and thorough acquaintance with our duty to God and man will counteract this influence aided a knowledge of common school attainments we need not say. The We have thrown these remarks together more as loose hints for the consideration of our readers than with any idea of furnishing a complete view of so wide and important a subject. We may be induced hereafter to review the question more in detail. The plan itself as confessed by the Chanceller of the Exchequer has at present assumed a very imperfect shape. Americe we have not seen and can only speak from the reports of other. Those reports are sufficiently discouraging. On the contrary all who have seen and described the Cape have united in praising it. Food is cheap and abundant the price of labour is exceedingly high trade is important and increasing many parts of the colony are beautiful and its climate is mild and healthy. There are few countries upon earth where so many components of happiness will be found to concentrate. ,undefined

The whole population of Mogadoru is between 10 and 12000 persons ; by far the greater part of whom consider it contrary to their religious tenets to use any caution to prevent their taking the infection ; and in the event of their having it would not for the same reason have recourse to any means to counteract it. ,undefined
        ID168,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,07,12,inform,India We have great pleasure in publishing the following interesting letter from India: – Madras Feb. 4 1820. I have thank God no very brilliant events to communicate to you but if the happiness of man is the legitimate object of all Government it is good to learn that British India is at peace and that a temperate and radical reform is gradually going on under the Marquess of Hastings' administration. The establishment of schools and a free press are the moving principles by which this great advancement in the state of society will be accomplished unless checked by impious powers. On the subject of these schools it is not necessary here to dilate. Suffice it to observe that it is in the power of any Government abitrary or free to educate the great bulk of its subjects and thereby to advance them in knowledge civilization and happiness in the shortest possible period. The establishment of a free press in Asia is in my estimation as useful and magnanimous an art as ever adorned the biography of any Statesman. What say its detractors is setting loose a parcel of printer's devils so great an act? No but setting loose all the intelligence of the age to work upon the public mind and conduct is an act of unrivalled benevolence. Be it asserted that a free press is only applicable to an advanced state of society I deny the position ; it is not founded in reason or experience. I contend on the other hand that where least knowledge and msot evil exist there is the greatest scope for improvement ; and I offer Scotland as a proof of the efficacy? of education and a free press. The Marquess of Hastings Governor General of India has in the newspapers of Madras and Calcutta been accused of having sent two persons of the name of Hastings to unhealthy climates the one to the East and the other to the West Indies where they died ; and for the base purpose of securing to his family the title of Huntingdon. This you must be aware was touching his sensitive honour to the quick ; and it would seem as if some one inimical to a free press had introduced the paragraph to irritate him. But this virtuous man who would not tread on an insect allowed this shameful slander to pass unnoticed. It stood refuted in every bosom and his manly forbearance tended but to give further proofs of his attachment to our infant liberty. Attacks have likewise been made on Sir E. East our Chief Justice. He complained they say of these alleged libels to the Chief Magistrate who desired him to have recourse to the law Conceive not however that I am the advocate for a licentious press. My maxim is that a great power when mischievously applied must be hurtful and when well applied beneficial in proportion to its strength. You will rejoice to learn that Mr Elphinstone Governor of Bombay has done away with the Censorship of the Press. This wise Statesman being a friend to freedom and having experienced the benefits which had arisen in Bengal from the measure (for scarce a day no passes that some abuse is not brought to light by the press) adopted it the moment he came into power and thus proved himself a public benefactor. To conclude it is my firm conviction that the diffusion of knowledge through the medium of education and a free press will more than any other measure accelerate the improvement and heighten the prosperity not only of British India but of the surrounding world. ,undefined

The Rev. Mr Easton of Montreal goes out with the Prompt. The Hibernia M'Eachren from the Clyde to Buenos Ayres was totally lost the 15th April near Maldonado. Crew saved. Discovery of a New Island off Cape Horn A new island has been discovered off Cape Horn in inst. 61 deg. long. 55 deg. by the ship William on a voyage from Monte Video for Valparaiso. The same having been dispatched by Captain Sheriff of the Andromache frigate to survey the coast had explored it for 200 miles. The captain went ashore found it covered with snow and uninhabited. Abundance of seals an whales were found in its neighbourhood. He has named the island New Shetland. Accounts from Constantinople dated May 26 annouce that the armaments against Ali Pacha are upon the most formidable scale and are actively pursued.– The latter has obtained hostages of his principal officers as pledges of their fidelity. On the 14th two new ships of the line were launched in the presence of the Sultan and his Grand Dignitaries at the hour fixed by the chief astrologers. The navigation between Bagdad? and Bassurah has been free since the defeat of the Arabs by the English. The latter it is stated have facilitated the intercourse between those two places by the establishment of parket-boats. ,emigration and immigration;privateering;shipping;shipwreck;Ottoman Empire
        ID170,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,07,12,inform,Colonial Intelligence Proposed New Monarchy in South America Accounts have beenreceived from Buenos Ayres by the Blossom sloop of War of a curious nature.– They relate to a project said to have been in agitation for placing a Prince of the House of Bourbon at the head of an independent Sovereignty on the River Plate.– The circumstance has been brought to light by the late changes in the Government of Buenos Ayres. From the documents now published and received by the Blossom it appears that in June 1819. Gomez the Envoy from Buenos Ayres at Paris was invited to a conference by M. De Cazes then French Minister for Foreign Affairs the object of which was to communicate a project of the French Cabinet for the colonsolidation of the Independent Government of South America. This project the French Minister observed would meet with the decided approbation of the Continental Powers especially Russia and Austria. Great Britain might not like it but yet would not find any good pretence for resisting it ; and his Catholic Majesty would yield to the influence of all Europe with the better grace as his former dependencies would be only transferred to a branch of his own family. The King of France would furnish assistance of every king and employ every means even to the supply of troops for carrying the affair into execution. On the 26th of October last when the statement of his conference reached Buenos Ayres Rondeau then Director ad interim made a secret communication to the Congress and transmitted to them the letter of the Envoy together with the French memorial ; on the following day and on the 3d of November the matter was discussed in secret meetings and the result was an? opinion that the Constitution lately-sworn allowed no alteration to be made in the form of Government till after the meeting of the Chambers. That a branch of the Bourbon family so closely connected with the reigning Monarch of Spain was in itself an insuperable objection as also the consideration that the Prince proposed and supported by the Powers of the European Continent would naturally more incline towards the views of his protectors than towards those of South America which ought to avoid all connexion with European continental politics ; and that Great Britain was the power from which South America had most to fear and most to expect. It was at the same time suggested that the Envoys in Europe shoud put the communications from Paris into the hands of the British Minstry whose good opinion and protection South America is most anxious to conciliate. Our Cabinet has always treated the South Americans with the greatest reserve as if feating contamination by simple contact–a delicacy towards Spanish interests and feelings which appears in itself commendable but when measured by the standard of national benefit may not merit the same praise. As it is it would seem that the British interest is likely to gain the ascendacy in the river Plate rather through the disposition of the inhabitants than from any influence exerted by our Ministers. We shall only add that thought the negotiation was carried on by the Duke de Cazes the project did not originate with him and did not at first apply to the Prince de Lucca. It was intended as an opening for one more nearly allied to the reigning family in France. ,undefined
        ID171,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,07,19,inform,Emigration. We extract the following statement from the Montreal Herald and an important one it is to those who are desirous of emigrating as well as to those who from patriotic motives would wish to turn the tide of emigration into a channel which while it relieve the mother country now may hereafter add to her strength and resources : Number of British subjects that emigrated to the United States who received recommendations for grants of land and removed to the province of Upper Canada from James Buchanan Esq. his Majesty's Consul at New York in the year 1819 : – English { Farmers..... 180 Women..... 118 Children..... 157 Mechanics..... 117 Women..... 57 Children..... 92 } 1021 Scotch { Farmers..... 50 Women..... 11 Children..... 15 Mechanics..... 30 Women..... 9 Children..... 36 } 131 Irish { Farmers..... 184 Women..... 94 Children..... 319 Mechanics..... 75 Women..... 42 Children..... 98 } 810 Total.........1962 We cannot give publicity to the above return without observing how eminently calculated such a document is to open the eyes of our too credulous yet industrious and loyal countrymen ; many of whom are still disposed to look to the United Statesm as the abode of independence and the source of affluence. Here we see nearly 2000 British subjects who in one season through the agency alone of one of our Consuls(withoutany pecuniary aid) have removed from the United States to Upper Canada. Their trieal and failure in the former as well as the trial and failure of the great numbers who have returned to this country are circumstances well calculated to direct the attention of those who have emigration in view at once to Upper Canada. We have made enquiry about these hitherto unknown but truly fertile regions ; and we are informed from a most authentic and satisfactory source that there there are unlocated lands fertile beyond the conception of those who have not seen them capable of receiving ten millions of inhabitants ; that the winters are not so cold nor the summers so hot as in the State of New York ; that these regions have proved eminently healthy to the vast numbers that have poured into them of late years ; and that the administration of the laws the state of education and religious instruction and above all the peace and quiet of the inhabitants have found there have exceed their most sanguine expectations. It may be desirable to state that grown persons can get by water from Quebec to York the capital of Upper Canada for about 28s ; children half price ; that to all persons properly recommended as to good conduct a grant of land is given according to their means of cultivation ; that this grant becomes their own for ever and they may dispose of it as they please. ,undefined
        ID172,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1820,08,02,inform,Colony at the Cape of Good Hope (Extract of a Letter dated off Madeira ) Aurora Transport Ship Feb 19. An opportunity having offered for transmitting a hasty account of the Aurora and Brilliant transports proceeding with settlers to the Cape of Good Hope I feel happy in availing myself of that circumstance with a view as well to gratify our friends in England as to add another confirmation of the liberality of Government in our important undertaking. First it will be necessary to state that the two ships sail in company and are every day within hail of each other ; the former commanded by Captain Pearson and the latter by Captain Bothwell who is accompanied by Lieutenant Pritchard as agent to both vessels. We sailed from Gravesend on. Our course down Channel was most favourable and the weather has hitherto been propitious. No death disease or serious accident has occurred in either ship and blooming health and vigour now rapidly succeed the langour produced by a sudden transition to a new element. Provisions consisting of flour currants suet? oatmeal peas butter cheese tea sugar biscuit salt pork and beef of excellent quality are liberally supplied together with a proper allowance of rum vinegar mustard and spices. The ships are fitted up in every respect comfortably and commodiously and the most perfect harmony prevails if we except bickerings amongst the old women about fractured teapots and mislaid culinary articles. The attention paid to the comfort of the passengers and more especially to that of the women and children by the Captains and the agent (Mr Pritchard) is highly creditable to the instructions received from Government. Although I do not sail in the same ship Captain Bothwell. I have had ample proofs of the kindness and humane liberality which he shews to the passengers in the Brilliant. Captain Pearson is an active intelligent officer who has been 23 years in the Transport Service under Government : he has sailed to almost every part of the world and Algoa Bay our place of destination is quite familiar to him. It may be egotism to speak of myself; but I trust I may be excused in boasting that of the crew and 240 passengers not one is seriously indisposed at present and wishing with heartfelt sincerity to my friends in England happiness peace and tranquility in as good health as I now enjoy long may they live long live the Constitution: and while on Fish River or Orange River we encounter the difficulties incident to new colonists may England and South Africa be ever united by the ties of mutual friendship–the one affording her parental arms and the other mindful of her filial duty.

His Excellency the Governor Sir R. S. Donkin was taking some effectual measures to place the coinage of the colony upon a better footing and on the 13th of October he issued a Proclamation for destroying a very large quantity of base money. He has also taken measure to communicate to the new settlers from England the full benefit ofthe Courts of Justice esblished in that quarter of the world. We have received an account of the loss of the Abeona? transport bound to the Cape of Good Hope with settlers. The following is an extract of a letter from the Agent to Lloyd's dated Lisbon 20th Dec. The Condessa da Ponte which arrived on the 20th inst. from Marenham? has brought 49 persons who escaped from the Abeona transport bound to the Cape of Good Hope which took fire and was burnt on the 25th ult. in lat. 5 N. long–and 113 lives were lost. The Agent Lieut. Madge the Captain Surgeon 21 men 16 boys 4 women and 5 girls got into three boats and fortunately fell in with the Condessa da Ponte the morning after the fatal event. Demerara Gazettes to a late date have been received which give detailed accounts of the number and state of the slaves in that part of the West Indies. The report is given by James Robertson Esq. the new Slave Registrat of the United Colony. It is a triennial statement of the slave population and the Reporter makes some judicious comparative remarks. It appears that there has been a large decrease of the number by deaths but the Creoles are greatly increased as compared with the former year. Births have been in the proportion of one to forty-six. The Report defends the ? of the West India Planters and observes that the state of the Black population serves? to evil for little or no ? ; so great is the kindness the liberality and induglent care of propiertors. It adds that their own interests is a perpetual? evil? upon their humanity. In the colony there ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? slaves on the island ? Africans? and Creoles and there are 38910 female slaves of the same donomination making a total of 76929. The slave population in 1817 amounted in the whole to 77867.– The number of births which have occurred since that period is 5317 and deaths 7140. The Report concludes with some gratifying observations upon the flourishing state of the colony. ,undefined
        ID175,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1821,01,31,inform,Colonial Intelligence Success of the Cutch Expedition against the Sindeans –The following extract of a letter from Bombay bringing this intelligence we copy from Carrick's Post which appears to have exclusive means of obtaining information on India affairs:– Bombay Sept. 12 1820. While I was seeing the last of your goods on board last night a vessel arrived in the harbour having on board an officer from Cutch who was the hearer of the official intelligence of the complete success of Sir Charles Culville's expedition against the Sindeans. The expedition consisted of 12000 men commanded by his Excellency the Commander in Chief ; from all I could clean of intellience from the followers it appeared there had been some hard fighting for five days ; but it ended as might be anticipated from the imposing force sent against the Sindeans. The moment the officer (who is one of the Staff and an Irishman) landed he set out for the Government House to inform Lady Colville of the event as it must be supposed she was in a state og anxiety her husband being the commander and her brother and her uncle Colonel T. Blair being also on the expedition. At day-light this morning orders arrived from the Government House to secure a passage and private cabin for the officer in th ship which takes this to England but there was no such accomodation as the cabins were all full ; and as another vessel will not sail from thence about ten days this and will be off to-day the chance is you will have this letter at least six weeks before the officers can reach England with the official intelligence. All kinds of European produce are a drug hee paricularly fine goods ; and rum brandy and geneva are for a song. The cholera has rather abated but still rages in a frightful manner. The Rio Janeiro packet arrived on Tuesday with letters to the 21st of November. Advices had been received from Rio Grande stating that Artigas had been taken prisoner. The Portuguese frigate Union had captured two insurgent privateers which had been committing depredations on the coast. The events in Portugal owing to which as well as to the idea that the King would be prudent enough to sanction what had taken place in Portugal the prices of produce had experienced very trifling alteration though if the contrary should be the case a considerable rise was anticipated. The following relates to what is passing in Peru :– Extract of a letter from Rio Janeiro dated November 20 :– The Chilians have at length carried into effect their boasted expedition which left Valparaiso on the 21st August and arrived at Pisco at the beginning of September. San Martin landed 4500 men but the blacks cattle &c. had all been previously sent away from the estates in that quarter so that they will be disappointed in meeting with partisans ; indeed the slaves and lower orders whom they expected to find favourable to their views are the most irritated against the insurgents. We have letters from Lima to the 12th September which speaks of the little apprehensions entertained of San Martin and his troops the Viceroy having a formidable force in the capital and vicinity of 8000 men commanded by good officers. The Viceroy is Commander-in-Chief La Serna second and La Mar and O'Reilly command divisions. They were observin San Martin's movements who already experienced the difficulties of subsisting his men. The Marquis of Vallembrozo was on his flank with a strong detachment of cavalry with a view to prevent him from sending emissaries into the interior and collecting horses. It is thought the insurgents will soon have to re-embark ; for as soon as they are a little pressed for provisions and fighting comes on numbers will desert. Those who have already come over describe their situation as very critical. Two vessels one an English and the other a French were preparing to sail from Callao for this place and by them we shall receive further particulars. The most enthusiastic preparations were making in Lima to proclaim the constitution in a formal manner for which purpose orders had been received from Madrid. This of itself is sufficient to defeat all views Cochrane and San Martin may have on the country except as before a little plunder on the open and defenceless parts of the coast. Letters from Sierra Leone dated the 24th of Nov. mention that the whole squadron was lying there.– The Pheasant Myrmidon Snapper and Thistle were lying off the Cape waiting for the Morgiana to complete her water provisions &c. which ship was obliged to be assisted by the squadron in consequence of her very sickly state. She had recently arrived from the River Gambia whither she had proceeded in dread of attack by the natives on our infant colony there. A letter of thanks had been voted to Captain Finlason by the merchants of that colony for the very able manner in which he brought to an amicable conclusion the differences between the Native Chiefs and the British interests in the Gambia. The Morgania brought from the Gambia Dr Dochard and forty-six men belonging to the mission under Major Gray for exploring Africa. Dr D. had been at Sago ; but in consequence of internal wars he was unable to proceed further. Major Gray was there with very few men ; he will not proceed further for some time. ,undefined

Providentially the first shock did not throw down many so that the inhabitants had time to escape before succeeding shocks otherwise theloss would have been dreadful. Only ten lives have been lost but not a house in the town has escaped without some injury. The town is still in a complete state of confusion ; one thousand give hundred houses more being so much injured as to be marked in order to be pulled down ; all the steeples in the place must be taken down. The streets are almost impassable from the fallen houses ; and great caution is required in walking to avoid the ruins that are still falling. ,undefined
        ID180,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1821,06,27,inform,Colonial Intelligence We have received Canada Papers to the 10th May. The active exertions of the Governor to improve the inland navigation had given very general satisfaction. In the course of the Session of the Colonial Parliament which was prorogued on the 14th April no less than three Addresses were presented to Earl Dalhousie to be forwarded to the King ; one respecting the allowance of half-pay to the Militia ; another respecting the duties imposed in British ports on lumber from Canada ; and third related to the losses sustained by the people of Canada during the late war. His excellency the Governor had intimated that no objection would be made to the repeal of the grant of 2500l on account of the Civil List for the Colony provided the salaray of the Chief retired Justice the ReceiverGeneral and that of the Speaker of the House of Assembly should be continued in the whole amounting to 1800l. The grant has for some time been a prominent subject of complaint in the Colonial Parliament. The 37th Regiment for three years stationed in Lower Canada is about to leave the Colony for England. The Staff Corps was to proceed to the Ottawa to carry into effect the intended plan for removing the obstructions in that river. An article from Montreal dated May 5 states that a messenger was leaving that place to announce the union of the North and Hudson's Bay Companies at their respective establishments. The former of these companies was under control of Lord Selkirk and the schism that has so long reigned between them with its fatal consequences is well know to the Public. By Letters from Bombay we learn that 20 ships have been taken up by the vigilant Governor on board of which 5000 troops are embarked destined to the Persian Gulph to repair the disaster suffered by the surprise of the detachment left by Sir Wm. Kier under the direction of a young man. The gallant Gen. Lionel Smith has been selected for this important service ; and we have no doubt but that he will convince the Arabs of the impolicy of their treacherous proceedings and justify the high confidence which the Go vernment of Bombay have in his talents and valour.– His Excellency Mr. Elphinstone completely recovered is gone on a tour to Kutch to settle all disputes and to ascertain the true situation of the country.– How important it is for the Heads of the Presidencies thus to judge from actual observation instead of trusting to mere reports. This proves the benefits of appointing men of experience and energy in the conduct of our Indian Empire–which is now throuh the admirable conduct of the Governor General and the two other Presidencies in a state of unexampled tranquility and prosperity. ,undefined

Colliver a Gentlemen belonging to the county of Cornwall and who is an Officer in the service of the African Comapny:– Cape Coast Castle April 21 1821. By the time you have received this it is probable the African Company will have ceased to exist ; we have received orders to hold ourselves in readiness to deliver up the Forsts and Settlements here to Government. It is understood they are to be put on the same footing as Sierra Leone. A list has been furnished to Government by the Company's Committee of their Officers their age length of service the situations they fill ; their emoluments? &c. We have been blockaded here since the 10th of February by the Ashantees? (an African tribe) who have commenced hostilities against us. On the day before mentioned our Governor received intelligence that a black man belonging to Cape Coast where the people are under our protection had been cruelly murdered by a Chief of the Fantes? at a place about six miles from Cape Coast called Moree?. I was immediately ordered to assemble all the soldiers I could in five minutes and proceed to Moree to seize the murderer. I quickly set off with four officers and 85 soliders. A little before we entered the town of Moree where the savages between 2 and 3000 in number were assembled we saw the mangled remains of their unforunate victim. The town stands near the top of a hill on the summit of which is an old Dutch Fort. As soon as we entered the town a fire was opened upon us ; but as my orders were to seize the murderer if possible without bloodshed I did not for some time allow the men to return the fire. However perceiving they were resolved to oppose us I gave directions to my little party to give them a volley and then to charge. The negroes retired as we advanced and in less than an hour we gained the hill from which our opponents fled in every firection. We demanded the keys of the fort from the principal man belonging to Moree ; who not being engaged in the affair had remained and who immediately gave them up. In the fort which has a draw-bridge we were perfectly secure from the attack of the negroes. The body we defeated were Fantees who were assembled to assist the Ashantees in enforcing some very unjust demands made by them on the people of Cape Coast. As soon as the Ashantees who reside near Cape Coast learned that the Governor had sent an armed force against their friends their drum beat to arms and they hastened after us ; fortunately we had defeated our opponents before they arrived. However they rallied the Fantees and took a position about half a mile from the town with a determination to oppose our little party. The Governor apprised of our situation assembled all the forces he could muster and speedily about 500 of the Cape Coast people headed by our officers and carrying the British flag were seen approaching. The enemy immediatel retired and we were relieved from our disagreeable situation after having been from nine in the morning till four in the afternoon exposed to a burning sun without refreshment. The negroes had 47 killed and upwards of 100 wounded in this affair ; we had one soldier killed and four wounded. Since the affair we have not seen one of the Ashantees or the Fantees here ; and a total stoppage of trade has taken place. We have not learned how the King of Ashantee intends to act nor is it safe to venture out of our limits except in large parties. New South Shetland –The Lord Melville J.

Good ploughmen are wanted and good footploughs with spare wrought-iron shares and coulters which are very expensive here ; iron-work nothing under 1s. per lb. Ransome's ploughs sell for 14l. each. Ploughmen will find plenty of employers at from 2l. to 8l. per month and their board. Meat sells at 2d. per lb ; wheat 12s. bushel ; and barley 6s. Other articles of housekeeping are about the same price as in England ; but on the other hand we are in one of the healthiest climates in the world and free from rent tithes and taxes of every description. Any one may live here as well with 500l. as in his native land with 5000l. The farming work is still? done with oxen which are very fine and bought at 3l. each ; cows are 30s. ; and sheep 6s. a-head (having tails that weight 8lb. a complete lump of fat) ; clothes linen and all English goods very dear.– Good mechanics of any description have very high wages. A cargo of Ladies would make a good speculation in proceeding to the New Settlement ; for all that came out with the settlers have got husbands. By letters received from the Cape of Good Hope we understand that the Royal African corps was disbanded there on the 26th of June last. By letters from Bombay dated the 24 of May we learn that the Governor the Honourable Mr. Elphinstone has returned to the Presidency after a five months' tour to the northward.

He also sent out strong detachments to reduce some predatory hordes who have long plundered the country and been a terror to the peaceable natives. Those plunderers are are called Bheels?. They live in the hills and woods and descend in bands to commit their depredations. By these letters we learn what is essential for young men going out to India to know that Writers and Cadets now undergo an examination as to their knowledge of the native languages ; and no youth has a chance of success who is ignorant of the Hindoustanee?. The highest respect is entertained for the able manner in which the disinterested Dr. Gilchrist prepares young men for the services.

It did immense damage especially at Budekomba? where the sea rose several times to a prodigious height and then falling in with the incredible rapidity alternately deluged and left the shore destroying all the plantations from Bontain to Boelekomba?. Many hundred have lost their lives. The fort of Boelekom-? ba was much damaged that of Bontain less so. On the 4th of January this year there was another shock of an earthquake but we do not learn that it did any damage. It is with much regret we lay before our readers the following details of a most calamitous fire which broke out at Halifax Nova Scotia on the 17th ult. : Halifax Sept. 17. The conflagration this morning was one of the most awful and destructive every witness in Halifax. It originated in Sackville-street in the Bakery occupied by Shay and Milany and before it was discovered had gained an alarming height. It was near two o'clock when the bells were rung. The troops seamean of his Majesty's ships and inhabitants soon assembled ; the engines were judiciously placed lines formed to different reservoirs of water and every exertion made to extinguish the fire but we regret to state that before any check could be given to it the whole block of buildings with the exception of a house situated at the corner of Sackville and Blowers'-streets occupied by Mr H. Croskill the houses occupied by Mrs. Neilson and Mr T. Muirhead on Barringtonstreet and a stable belonging to J. W. Johnston Esq. in Granville-street were consumed. For some time great apprehensions were entertaintained that the fire would extend to the houses on the opposite side of the streets but fortunately it did not. Of the property burnt only about t1500 were insured and the calamity has mostly fallen where it will long be severely felt–upon windows and orphan children– upon industrious tradesmen whose whole stock of worldly wealth was invested in the tenements they occupied. To the troops and the seamen of the ships of war the town is as usual greatly indebted for the exertions made by them. Twenty-one houses were consumed with other valuable property. America appears to be very unhealthy just now– The accounts from Long Island Baltimore Amelia Island and Norfolk are extremely calamitous. The whole of Amelia Island is a perfect hospital not one family being well and in many instances not one to assist another. So dreadful indeed is the disease that there is not one sentinel to do duty. A New York Paper of the 30th ult. says– We are sorry to perceive from the Franklin Gazette that the malignant fever continues to make serious ravages among our fellow citizens at Baltimore. Four full victims to it in the 24 hours ending on Sunday morning ; and six during the 24 hours ending Monday morning. ,undefined
        ID185,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1821,11,07,inform,Colonial Intelligence In our last paper we gave from the Jamaiza Gazettes an account of the dreadful drought which had prevailed in that island for more than twelve months and the consequences of which had been most calamitous. We are now however most happy in being able to state upon the authority of a Gentleman who left Jamaica some days subsequently to the date of our preceding advices that this terible evil in such a climate particularly had at length ceased. The following is the substance of the information which has been communicated to us:– A few hours previous to my going on board the Jamaica packet on the 3d of September the rain fell in such torrents as to flood the streets of Kingston to the depth of two feet and it seemed to be general throughout the district of Liguanea. Though too late to save the crop of sugar for the present or perhaps the ensuing year this seasonable change of weather would at least have the effect of staying the mortality among the cattle. As such those interested in the island will receive the intelligence with gratification. On some properties the canes had been cut as fodder to save the stock. We have the Cape of Good Hope papers to the 6th August and as they are unusually barren in their contents it is fair to infer that every thing was proceeding there in a satisfactory manner. The only article of the slightest interest relates to the change the Governor is gradually effecting in the currency by removing from it all the base metal and substituting gold and silver of standard value. The Gazette of Dordrecht publishes accounts from Java to the 29th May. They confirm the statement of the decrease of the malady and mention that it was almost wholly subdued in the district of Samarang but that 18000 persons mostly Europeans had fallen victims. Batavia and Sourabaya were still infected. India –Extract of a letter from Calcutta dated June 20:– If the extension of foreign trading be considered with you as a means suited to alleviate the pressure and ease the difficulties of Old England which we read of here we imagine that India can furnish beneficial openings to this kind of remedy. The use of articles of British production and exports is gaining ground rapidly here ; the English printed cottons are now carried in considerable quantities as far as Rajpootha and find a ready sale if they be of handsome patterns. The warehouses now are so far from being overstocked that before the arrival of two vessels from England in the last fortnight all European articles were exorbitantly high ; mustard flour sold about 20s. a pound ; cheese 1? ; ham three half crowns the ld ; a common round hat three guineas. These undoubtedly were prices arising from an unusual scarcity ; but it surely cannot be so very bad a trading which admits even indicidentally of such an exaggeration of price and profit. Government bonds are now at six per cent premium though they bear but half the usual or legal interest of the country. This is a tolerable evidence of the credit of the Company and the Government. There is a great and increasing prosperity in Hindostan. The augmented cultivation of the Upper Provinces within these two years is surprising. ,undefined
        ID358,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1817,01,08,entertain,DREADFUL MASSACRE BY THE NATIVES OF THE MARQUESAS ISLANDS. From the Sydney Gazette Nov. 8. 1815. By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler and part of the crew of the India brig Matilda which sailed from this Colony in August 1813 bound on a voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands and from thence to China; but was cut off and plundered on the night of the 10th of April last while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay at the Island of Rooapoah one of the Marquessas on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted and joining with some of the Rooapoah natives took the opportunity of a dark night and the wind blowing fresh right on the land to cut the vessel adrift; by which means she drove ashore through a heavy surf and was soon bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat they concurred universally in the design of putting the whole of her crew to death; which appears to have been a constant practise among the different natives towards one another when their canoes happen to fall upon a strange land through stress of weather or from any other accident. Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their Chief or King Nooahetu who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld his assent to the murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of the vessel. The crew were informed by such expressions as they could understand as well as by the gesticulations that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion that their lives were dependent on the issue; the good Chief was opposed by many other Chiefs who though somewhat inferior in rank were very far superior in number supported by the common usages of the island from which the exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated with his son by his side on a mat in his own dwelling; he had been called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish of the people as it was not a hereditary right but an elective dignity. His people pressed their solicitations earnestly and at length peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length of time opposed by the force of words which not seeming likely to prevail he adopted a method which silenced the whole in an instant and saved the lives of Captain Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his expostulations were defeated on the principle of undeviating custom he deliberately took up two ropes that were near him and fixing one round the neck of his son and the other round his own called to the Chief next in command who immediately approached him. His conference was short and decisive–he first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of his son and then to the other which he had entwined round his own. These strangers are doomed to death said he by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit that I who am their King should live to see so vile a deed perpetrated.– Let my child and myself be strangled before it is performed; and then it never will be said that we sanctioned even with our eyesight the destruction of these unoffending people. The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce even in the mind of the unenlightened savage a paroxysm of surprise mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which the untaught man may possibly excel his fellow-creature whose conceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly upon their King whose person they adored because that his principles were good and his government just and mild. They saw the obedient Chief to whom the order of strangulation had been imparted staring with horror and amazement at the change which a few moments had produced; the mandate which had proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed; and commanded to perform the dreadful office he proceeded to obey– when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. The King! the King! from every lip burst forth– 'What! kill the King! No no let all the strangers live–no man shall kill the King! Thus were their lives preserved and the vessel plundered of every thing on board her. The floor of the Greenwich which was burnt at Nooaheva still remains and is dry at low water. All her iron and copper have been taken out by the natives who have a thorough knowledge of the use of these materials. That they are cannibals is well ascertained. They form distinct factions and make war upon the ruling Chief. The rebels are denominated the Typees; and the opposite parties are horribly sanguinary towards each.– Six of the adverse party were killed and devoured by the rebels while Captain Fowler was among them and the following detestable circumstance occurred on the occasion:–A native man belonging to Port Anna Maria who was not tattooed and in consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh on pain of death impatient of the restraint fell upon one of the murdered bodies and darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a voracious fury exhaled the crimson moisture which had not yet coagulated. ,cannibalism;Pacific Islanders
