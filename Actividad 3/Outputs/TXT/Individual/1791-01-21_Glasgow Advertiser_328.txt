 The following, it is said, are the authentic particulars of General St Clair's expedition in America. The Miamis Indians had been for a long time extremely troublesome to the Americans, and it was determined to drive them to the back country. General St. Clair completely accomplished this object; but on the 22d Oct. a detachment of 400 Americans fell in with the Indians on the River St. Joseph, where a severe battle was fought. Many Indians were killed, but the Americans lost the field; several Officers, and 150 men were killed, and they were not able even to bring off their wounded. This success will in all probability give the Indians new courage, and induce them again to make head against the American army.
