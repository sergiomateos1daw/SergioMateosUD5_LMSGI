Colonial IntelligenceWe have received letters and papers, from the Cape of Good Hope, to the 22d October, and they are satisfactory in all points of view, but especially with reference to the new settlement at Algoa Bay. His Excellency, the Governor, Sir R. S. Donkin, was taking some effectual measures to place the coinage of the colony upon a better footing, and on the 13th of October he issued a Proclamation for destroying a very large quantity of base money. He has also taken measure to communicate to the new settlers from England the full benefit ofthe Courts of Justice esblished in that quarter of the world.We have received an account of the loss of the Abeona[?] transport, bound to the Cape of Good Hope, with settlers. The following is an extract of a letter from the Agent to Lloyd's, dated Lisbon, 20th Dec. "The Condessa da Ponte, which arrived on the 20th inst. from Marenham[?], has brought 49 persons, who escaped from the Abeona transport, bound to the Cape of Good Hope, which took fire and was burnt on the 25th ult. in lat. 5 N. long--and 113 lives were lost. The Agent, Lieut. Madge, the Captain, Surgeon, 21 men, 16 boys, 4 women, and 5 girls, got into three boats, and fortunately fell in with the Condessa da Ponte, the morning after the fatal event."Demerara Gazettes to a late date have been received, which give detailed accounts of the number and state of the slaves in that part of the West Indies. The report is given by James Robertson, Esq. the new Slave Registrat of the United Colony. It is a triennial statement of the slave population, and the Reporter makes some judicious comparative remarks. It appears that there has been a large decrease of the number by deaths, but the Creoles are greatly increased as compared with the former year. Births have been in the proportion of one to forty-six. The Report defends the [?] of the West India Planters, and observes that the state of the Black population serves[?] to evil for little or no [?] ; so great is the kindness, the liberality, and induglent care of propiertors. It adds, that their own interests is a perpetual[?] evil[?] upon their humanity. In the colony there [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] slaves on the island, [?] Africans[?] and Creoles and there are 38,910 female slaves of the same donomination, making a total of 76,929. The slave population in 1817, amounted in the whole to 77,867.--The number of births which have occurred since that period is 5,317, and deaths 7,140. The Report concludes with some gratifying observations upon the flourishing state of the colony.
