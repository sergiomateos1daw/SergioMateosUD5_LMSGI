American papers are received, dated October, 4.  1794. They contain two letters from General  Wayne to the American Secretary at War, giving  an account of a severe action he had with the Indi ans, who were assisted by the volunteers and militia  of Detroit on the 20th August, on the banks of  the Miamis, in the vicinity of the British post and  garrison at the foot of the Rapids.--The action  was bloody, and he says, "our army was left in  full and quiet possession of the field of battle, which  terminated under the influence of the guns of the  British garrison, as you will observe by the inclosed  correspondence which passed between Major Camp bell Commandant and myself upon the occasion."  He adds--"We remained three days and nights  on the banks of the Miamis, in front of the field  of battle; during which time all the houses and  corn fields were consumed and destroyed for a con siderable distance both above and below Fork Mia mis, as well as within pistol shot of that garrison,  who were compelled to remain tacit spectators to  this general devastation and conflagration, among  which were the stores and houses of Colonel Mac kee, the British Indian agent and principal stimu lator of the war now exiting between the United  States and the Savages. The American paper from which this account  is taken, does not give the correspondence above  alluded to, but concludes the article thus: "Besides the very important papers which we  have been able to offer to our readers this day, the  Executive, we understand, has received copies of a  correspondence between the British Major Camp bell, and General Wayne. The Major begins it  by inquiring of the General by what authority he  came there. The General answers by requiring  to know who gave Campbell authority to establish  a fort at that place, it being within our side of the  treaty boundary, and no such establishment there  when that instrument was signed. We hope ere  long our gallant General will give a good account  of this Mr. Campbell."
