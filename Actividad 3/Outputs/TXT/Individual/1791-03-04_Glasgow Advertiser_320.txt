 Mr. Bowles, the Cherokee Chief, proposes to introduce the art of Printing amongst the Indians, with whom he resides; and, for this purpose, has engaged two persons to accompany him on his return, and has provided himself with all the implements of the art. The day fixed for their departure is the 20th of MarchThe Indian companions of Mr. Bowles are two Creeks and two Cherokees. these nations, though contiguous to each other, and in strict union, differ as essentially as possible in language and manners. Both, however, entertain the most implacable animosity against the Spaniards, whose authority and dominions in South America they make no scruple of avowing they mean to try to diminish.
