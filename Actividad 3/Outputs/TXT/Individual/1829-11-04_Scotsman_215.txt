Swan River.--The ship Warrior, Stone, commander, bound to Swan River, Sydney, and the East Indies, sailed for her destination on Friday, from Portsmouth, with prospects of favourable weather in her progress down the Channel. The Warrior is a fine vessel of about 700 tons burden, and carried out upwards of 250 passengers to the new settlement. Several of the passengers are persons of independent fortune, who have embarked considerable property in the speculation ; and and two ofthem, named Byrne and Molloy, paid the enormous sum of L1,000 for the best accommodation the vessel could afford their families and suite. Six pianos are on board the Warrior, and a proportionate number of fair and accomplished vocalists and musicians of course accompany the instruments to their destination. The Warrior has also on board fifty dogs of the choicest breed, several pens of sheep, considerable number of swine, two milch cows, and three valuable horses ; but, as tempestuous weather may be anticipated on the vessel reaching the Bay of Biscay, apprehensions are entertained that a portion of the live cargo must be consigned to the ocean before the termination of the voyage. It is calculated that, from the advantageous arrangements entered into by the commander and a gentleman named Semple, who has chartered the Warrior, and gone out in her, they will clear the enormous sum of L10,000 by the voyage.
