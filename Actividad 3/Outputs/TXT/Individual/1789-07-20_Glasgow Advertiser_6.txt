Cent  is the only coinage the Americans have of their won. No less than 300 ton of them were contracted for by Congress in the year 1787, to be coined at the rate of 50 ton per annum ; the contracters were also bound down to make them all of the famous Jersey copper. They are a little larger than the British halfpence. No British copper no passes in the United States;--silver and gold coins of all nations, however, pass current. The congress have not yet ordered a silver coinage.
