Meeting on Emigration in Dublin.--One of the largest and msot influential meetings that we ever remember, says the Dublin Monitor  of Thursday, took place on Wednesday, at the Rotunda, to form an Association for the Promotion of Emigration to South Australia. In rank and numbers it was not surpassed. There could not be less than two thousand persons in the room. Colonel Torrens dwelt at considerable length on the causes of Irish misery, and proved fully, at least to our satisfaction, that a powerful and efficacious remedy was applicable in the objects of the meeting. The subject seemed to tell powerfully on the meeting ; the speakers were heard with great attention, and the applauses they received told that the public feeling was deeply identified with the future colony of New Ireland.
