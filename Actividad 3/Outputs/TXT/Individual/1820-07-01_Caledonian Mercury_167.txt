The New York Daily Advertiser says--"The line of battle ship New York, now finishing at our navy yard, at the Wallabut, is perhaps the most superior vessel ever built. Her tonnage is near 3000[?]: she measures 203 feet keel, and is by 15 feet the largest man of war ever laid down in this country. She will no doubt be rated a 74, but will be equal to a 100 gun-ship, and will carry 120 guns."
