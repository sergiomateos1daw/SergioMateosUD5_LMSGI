" There have been an amazing number of recruiting parties here these 8 days by gone, and I dare say they have got among them at least 200 recruits this week. Only in two or three particular instances have large sums been given--the bounty is generally from 5 to 6 guineas." This place is at present full of people, many of whom may be said to have no more than what keeps soul and body together--I heartily wish they would also take away our loose women--they were never so numerous, nor so troublesome. If it was not for the recruiting service, and the prospect of a Bridewell, which it is hoped our Magistates will shortly set seriously about, we would have but dismal prospects before us the ensuing winter.--I am informed, government propose sending 2000 of our bad women--they would never be missed out of this place."
