Papers from Madras to the 17th of January have been received. Accounts had arrived through Singapore, from the ship Mangles, stating that when passing through Torres Straits she touched at Murray's Island, where they discovered eight Europeans, part of the crew of the long-missing bark, Charles Eaton, in a state of slavery, but the natives would not deliver up the men. The Charles Eaton was supposed to have been lost on the Barrier Reef, in Torres Straits, in 1833, in prosecution of her voyage from New South Wales to Madras, but no precise intelligence of her fate was previously known. The ironworks which had been erected at Porto Novo were proceeding with activity, and some railing had been made there, quite equal, it is stated to anything og the kind manufactured in England.
