Extract of a letter from Philadelphia, dated Nov. 1."Advice received from Governor Blount, dated the latter end of September, informs us, that the Cherokees of the five lower towns on the Tenesee, headed by John Watts and Esquaka, or the bloody fellow, has declared war against the United States, and that the warriors, according to various authentic accounts, amount to near 600, including about one hundred banditti Creeks; another letter mentions that the above force had actually set out on some expedition against the frontiers; it is feared they will fall first on Cumberland settlement."
