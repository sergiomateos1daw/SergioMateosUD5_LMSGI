Letters from Quebec, dated Nov. 17, say, that every thing was quiet in that province.Some letters from Quebec were on Saturday received at the General Post Office, which state that the American army under the command of General Wayne had been routed by the Otoway Indians; an advanced party of 200 men had been entirely cut off: his army consisted of 400 regulars and 2,000 volunteers.
