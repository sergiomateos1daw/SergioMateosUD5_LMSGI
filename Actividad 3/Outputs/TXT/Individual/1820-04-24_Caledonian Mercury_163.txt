A common labourer from Scotland is entitled to a lot of land. Whenever he finds he can subsist upon his farm, he becomes as high as the best in the township. Every settler, though ever so poor, has a vote for the member for the township, and has full liberty to speak at every meeting. -- It is nothing uncommon to see a poor Glasgow weaver, who came among us with scarce a stitch to cover his nakedness, strutting between the stumps of his trees as pompous as an Ediburgh Magistrate."
