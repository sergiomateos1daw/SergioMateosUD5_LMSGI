South Australia.--The act of Parliament for founding this colony will now come into full operation ; the Commissioners having complied with the conditions precedent, by the sale of t35,000 worth of land, and by raisingthe required loan for the government of the colony. We may therefore expect shortly to see the names of the various officers gazetted (some of them have been long ago nominated) ; and we understand that active preparations are making with a view to the immediate departure of the officers and a small body of emigrants. This first expedition will be placed under the command of Captain Hindmarsh, R.N., the Governor ; who, with the assistance of the Surveyors and other qualified persons, will carefully examine the various harbours in the colony, the quality of the neighbouring soil, the supply of water, &c. ; and will select that site which, all things considered, is most desirable for the first town. We believe it is the intention of the Commissions not to send out the main body of emigrants until the next spring, so as to allow ample time for the necessary preparations for their reception.--Spectator.There have been 300 convents suppressed within the last three years. The example was set by the Emperor of Russia, who, was by an ukase, dated 31st July 1832, abolished 187 convents of monks. This was followed by the King of Prussia, who, by a royal order, secularised all the convents in the Duchy of Posen. In 1834, Don Pedro put down 300 convents, and Spain has lately abolished 1800.
