Emigration to New Zealand.--On Friday the Tyne left the London Dock, and proceeded down the river on her voyage to Port Nicholson, New Zealand. The Tyne is a fine new vessel, and she takes out 50 mechanics and labourers, with their families, from the Emigration Depot at Deptford, besides a number of other passengers, amongst whom are Mr Swainson, Chief Justice, and Mr Martin, Attorney-General, of the new colony, to which sations they have been recently appointed. The arrangements for the comfort of the emigrants on board were certainly very complete ; and it must be gratifying to know that those persons sent out by the company will be provided with a large proportion of their provisions fresh, a great quantity of patent preserved provisions being shipped for that purpose on board the Tyne. There are a greater number of children than usual in the Emigration Depot--many of the families consisting of from eight to twelve individuals. The Prince Rupert, which now lies in the London Dock, will clear out on the 10th inst ; and it is supposed she will pretty well clear the depot of its present inmates.
