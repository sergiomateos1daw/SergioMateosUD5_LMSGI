Emigration.--The Emigration Committee recently came to a resolution, "that adverting to the information imparted to the committee, both collectively and individually, of the excessive immorality stated to prevail in certain disticts of New South Wales, they have formed the opinion that they cannot conscientiously recommend to the Government to encourage the further emigration of single females, however well selected, unprotected by parents or near realtives, to Sydney."
