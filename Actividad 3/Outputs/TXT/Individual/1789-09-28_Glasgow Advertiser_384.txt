The American Congress have laid on port duties, which may be deemed moderate in several particulars, when compared to those of most of  the European kingdoms and cities, and in many  instances are much less than heretofore imposed by the Provincial Assemblies. This may be hugly prudent in a republic which is courting commerce for her ports and for such a variety of articles, the native products of that extensive region, to give in return for fabrics not yet manufactuted among themselves. Their tobacco, corn iron, hemp, flax lumber, & are inexhaustible sources of wealth, and their fisheries very considerable.
