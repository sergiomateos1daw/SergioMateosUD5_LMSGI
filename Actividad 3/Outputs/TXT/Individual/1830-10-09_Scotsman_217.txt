Swan River Settlement.--On the 13th inst. the Swedish ship Sterling, Captain D. E. Hogan, with a Swedish crew, sailedfrom Gottenburgh, Sept. 22, for the settlement in Swan River. Among the cargo are eleven wooden houses, built here, and consisting of four to ten rooms, which have been taken to pieces and will be easily put up again, all the pieces being marked. It is probable that many similar cargoes will follow, as timber and labour are so cheap in this country.
