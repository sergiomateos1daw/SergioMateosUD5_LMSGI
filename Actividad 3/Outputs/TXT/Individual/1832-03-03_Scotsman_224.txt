LeithExtensive preparations are already begun amongst e[?] shipping, for the various Spring voyages to distant ports[?]. Six vessels are advertised for America, one for Van Dieman's Land and New South Wales, and the whalers[?] are unfurling their canvass, and will sail for the [?] regions on Monday or Tuesday first. The departure of these ships will give the docks a naked appearance, the more apparent from the few foreign vessels present here.
