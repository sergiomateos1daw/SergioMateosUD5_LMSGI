Nassau, New England, March  12.The red bugs, which did so much injury to the cotton last year, have again made their appearance, but not in such numbers as was first expected.The hops in many States of America have been particularly productive.A letter from Great-Ogreechee, in Georgia, dated December 9th, says, "since the completion of the treaty with the Creeks, all has been very quiet, unless we except some ill-natured state - bickerings and heart-burning amongst ourselves, chiefly occasioned by a few influential men, who find themselves great losers by a general act of common justice towards the Indians. These, however, we expect, will subside by degrees; notwithstanding the formidable combination in a certain part of the State. As to the Creeks, Siminoles, and other nations adjoining our Western frontier, nothing is clearer than that, so far from being injurious to us, they may henceforward be made useful to the real interests of this State, provided the faith of treaties be observed. They now show every disposition to copy our manners, arts, agriculture, and mode of living.
