Musquito Shore. Intelligence has been received, that in some trivial dispute with a native Indian, a Spaniard has stabbed him to the heart with a stiletto, and then fled. The nation to whom the Indian belonged, being made acquainted with the murder, sent a deputation to the Governor, demanding that five Spaniards should be instantly delivered up as an attonement. This was peremptorily refused, as being more than commensurate to the offence, but the murderer was offered as a satisfaction; the Indians would not accept him singly, and departed, vowing the severest revenge: a few days afterwards intelligence was received that they had surprised and massacred sixteen men, who had been at work in the woods; and when the vessel departed, the Spaniards were flying, with the utmost precipitation and terror, from all parts of the country, seeking shelter in the forts.
