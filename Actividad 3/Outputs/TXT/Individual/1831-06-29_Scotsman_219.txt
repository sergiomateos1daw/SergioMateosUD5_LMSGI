The Wool Trade.--London, Thursday Night.--This afternoon the first sale of wools for a long time past took place at Garraway's Coffee-house. The quantity announced for sale to-day was nearly 200 bales, consisting of about 100 bales of New South Wales wool, 50 bales of Van Dieman's Land wools, &c. The New South Wales wool was first put up and went off very briskly at prices averaging from 1s 4 1/2d to 1s 10d per lb., which quotations are higher than those last obtained. The Van Dieman's Land wools were sold by order of the Van Dieman's Land Company, being a portion of the last arrivals from the Company's flocks. They met a very ready sale, and the average prices obtained were from 1s 5d to 2s 1d per lb. The arrivals from Germany and other places this year are expected to be very great.
