Emigration to Australia.--Several vessels have sailed within the last three weeks for our settlements in the souther hemisphere, with full cargoes of goods, and a large number of passengers. The South Australian packet-ship Orleana, will carry out nearly 250 passengers. Many of the emigrants are capitalists, and some to a considerable amount.General Flinter.--We are sorry to learn, by our letters from Madrid, that a very brave and deserving officer, General Flinter, committed suicide on the 9th instant in that city. General Flinter was an Irishman of good family. He served under the Duke of Wellington in Portugal and Spain, and was one of the many officers who joined the Portuguese and Spanish armies by permission of our Government.--Morning Post.
