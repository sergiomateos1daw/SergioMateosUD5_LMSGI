From Quebec, June 10, we are informed, Canada is at present greatly distressed; provisions extremely dear ; beef, if good for any thing, 5per pound ; mutton, 7--d. butter, 15d. The parishes in the upper country, about Niagara and Montreal, have been without bread for four months.There are orders now in town for as many goods for Quebec as will load ten ships; the trade being so exceedingly brisk, and the people giving the preference to European goods.
