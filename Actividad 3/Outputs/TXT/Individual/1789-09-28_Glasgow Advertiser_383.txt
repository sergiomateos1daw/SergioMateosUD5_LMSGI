Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Antiqua"A matter has lately happened here, which may perhaps be attended with serious consequences. There is a little island called Flat Island, near the Island of St. Martin's, which Sir Gillies Payne claims; he lately sent a few negroes there, who with a white man, were driven off by the French. A complaint has been made to Lieutenant-Governor Nugent, who means to know from the Baron de Clugny, whether he avows the fact; if he does, probably it may bring an open rupture, as out troops and ships may be sent down to protect it."
