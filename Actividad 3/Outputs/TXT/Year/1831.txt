The Wool Trade.--London, Thursday Night.--This afternoon the first sale of wools for a long time past took place at Garraway's Coffee-house. The quantity announced for sale to-day was nearly 200 bales, consisting of about 100 bales of New South Wales wool, 50 bales of Van Dieman's Land wools, &c. The New South Wales wool was first put up and went off very briskly at prices averaging from 1s 4 1/2d to 1s 10d per lb., which quotations are higher than those last obtained. The Van Dieman's Land wools were sold by order of the Van Dieman's Land Company, being a portion of the last arrivals from the Company's flocks. They met a very ready sale, and the average prices obtained were from 1s 5d to 2s 1d per lb. The arrivals from Germany and other places this year are expected to be very great.-----------------------------------------------------------------The brig Stirling Castle, Captain Fraser, sailed from Greenock on Wednesday morning, for Sidney, New South Wales, having on board the Rev.

This is a sly censure upon the habit of our countrymen, one-fifth, or sixth part of whom we were supposed by implication to be cut off permanently by intemperance! We admit that a few hearty fellows do go off in apoplexy; but we deny that the number bears any proportion to the amount supposed; we have two other remarks to make on his statement. First, since our manners were corrupted by imitating English  fashions, it is whispered, we hope un, that there are such things as tippling women in country, some of whom do disappear suddenly--no matter how; and secondly, we wish our London friend inform us how it happens, that while all Broad England has only an excess of 11 1/2 per cent females, Edinburgh should have no less than 24! We understand that since this astounding fact was brought out, there has been a great efflux of ladies from the city to the adjoining counties. We know a number who have or are flying to Fife and the north. A friend, who careful observer, compares it to the dispersion of the Jews. The ladies, he says, attribute their flight to Cholera Maribus!-----------------------------------------------------------------The Ann Jameson, Alexander, sailed from Leith Roads on Tuesday morning for Bombay, Van Diemen's Land, and New South Wales, with a full cargo, between twenty and thirty passengers, consisting mostly of young ladies.-----------------------------------------------------------------The Machine Breakers.--A convict ship at Portsmouth is on the point of sailing for Van Diemen's Land, with between two and three hundred convicts on board, who have been lately convicted for machinebreaking, extorting money, and other offences committed in the disturbed counties. Another ship, with convicts of the same description, will be dispatched for New South Wales, in about a fortnight. These convicts have been kept entirely separate from all other prisoners, and an accurate report will be made to the Governors of the Colonies, as to their former character, their trades and employments, and the recommendations which have been made in their favour subsequently to their trials. The capital convicts whose lives have been spared, are to be transported for life; and the convicts, sentenced and recommended by the Judges for transportation, are to be transported according to their respective sentences.-----------------------------------------------------------------
