On Monday a discussion of some interest took place in the House of Commons relative to the affairs of South Australia. Owing to certain defects in its government, that colony has fallen into a state of financial embarassment requiring immediate relief. Lord John Russell traced the history of the settlement from its foundation, and stated that, while its revenue does not exceed t20,000 its expenditure has increased to the enormous sum of t130,000 a year ! At present its affairs are managed by commissioners, the responsible Ministers of the Crown having no direct control over its expenditure. This is manifestly an evil, and must form the subject of future legislation, but in the meantime it is necessary to provide for the payment of certain bills now over-due. Accordingly, Lord John Russell proposed that her Majesty should be authorized to guarantee a loan of t210,000 for this purpose. Lord Stanley concurred generally in the views of the noble Secretary for the Colonies, but though that the Government ought not to demand a loan until they had brought in a bill to explain distinctly the principles on which they proposed that the colony should henceforth be governed. Sir Robert Peel suggested that the Government should ask a vote of credit for the sum required, which, as it met the urgency of the case, was ultimately agreed upon, and the subject was deferred till Friday.-----------------------------------------------------------------New South WalesMr Grote  rose to move a series of resolutions in condemnation of the application of a part of the Land and Emigration Fund of New South Wales to the maintenance of gaols and police in that colony. It was in 1831 that this expense, antecedently borne by the Home Government, was for the first time thrown upon the colony, whose revenues were then found to yield considerable surplus of revenue beyond expenditure. The charge so imposed at that time was calculated to be about t25,000 a year ; and had that been all the colony would have borne it without a murmur; but in fact it had ever since averaged nearly t60,000. It was not reasonable to impose such a charge on the colony, on account of gaols and police, constituted not the ordinary uses of a colonial society, but for the peculiar purposes of our transportation system. The argument urged by the Home Government was, that the expense was chiefly caused by the extensive distribution of convicts by assignment throughout the colony, whose settlers drew a proportional profit from the labour so assigned. But that assignment was a gain, not more to the colonists, who obtained the labour, than to the mother country, which saved the expense of maintaing the labourers. Whatever value the mother country might be entitled to claim for the labour of the convicts, ought in strictness to fall, not on the colony at large, but on the individual employers; and if there were valid reasons against an exaction of premium from them, still it was unjust to throw the obligation upon the colony at large. That was to pay private wages out of public rates. This one charge on the oclony was sufficient on account for all that embarassment in its finances which had been growing for the last six years. It had been enabled to defray the impact, only by resorting to the emigration fund, and thus checking emigration itself. No less than t260,000 had been abstracted from that fund to meet these costs of jails and police. The diversion of that fund from emigration was a great evil, both to the colony, where labour is so pressingly needed, and to the poor of this country, to whom that refuge is so material. He considered the emigration fund as held by the Government in trust for the united intersts of the colony and of the mother country. The great extent of sales of land in the colony had been [?] owing to the belief of the colonists that the proceed[?] would be applied to emigration.The hon. member was proceeding to cite the opinions of various persons in favour of this strict application, when a motion was made to count the House, and it adjourned for want of its quorum[?] of 40 members.-----------------------------------------------------------------We have received a copy of a Series of Resolutions passed, on the 23d of October 1840, by the Legislative Council of New South Wales, on the subject of immigration into colony. The object of these resolutions is to encourage emigration from the mother country, by showing the demand for labour in New South Wales, and the advantages offered to the immigrant. We have only room for a few of the more important resolutions :Resolved. That there exists throughout the colony an urgent and increasing want of working hands, in every branch of industry ; that there is ample employment for emigrants, at highly renumerating wages without the interruption, in this mild climate, experienced in colder countries during the winter months ; and that, even during the worst period of the past severe drought, no persons able and willing to work found any difficult in procuring advantageous employment.Resolved. That, in the opinion of this Council, there can be no more advantageous field for the employment of industry than is presented in New South Wales--experience proving, that able-bodied, sober, industrious and careful emigrants may, within a few years after their arrival, rise form the condition of labourers to be themselves employers of labour; by which process, and by the progressive increase of the flocks and herds of the colony, a constant demand for additional labourers is created, sufficient to remove all apprehension of a dearth of employment for as many as may arise.Resolved. That this Council would particularly instance the large and increasing sums at the credit of the working classes in the Savings Bank of New South Wales, as affording gratifying evidence of their prosperous condition, the deposits having increased from t24,469, the amount on 31st December 1835, to t127,000 on 31st August 1840.Resolved. That great additional advantage must accrue to the mother country from the large consumption in this colony of British produce and manufactures, the declared value of which, from 1826 to 1839, according to the official returns for that period, amounted to more than eight millions sterling, having progressively increased from t280,000, the amount in 1826, to t1,251,969 in 1839 ; whilst the exports from the colony, including the produce of the fisheries, increased from t106,600 in the former year, to t948,776 in the latter--the total amount being t6,187,530 for the whole period.Resolved. That the trade between the mother country and this colony, together with the whale fisheries in the adjourning seas, also affords a valuable nursery for seamen, important in this respect, in proportion to the distance from Great Britain, and calculated to strengthen and secure her maritime power ; and that this field for the employment of British shipping must increase with the growing prosperity of the colony--considerations which appear to this Council to constitute a strong additional claim, on the part of the colony, to the fostering care of the British Government.-----------------------------------------------------------------Emigration to New Zealand.--On Friday the Tyne left the London Dock, and proceeded down the river on her voyage to Port Nicholson, New Zealand. The Tyne is a fine new vessel, and she takes out 50 mechanics and labourers, with their families, from the Emigration Depot at Deptford, besides a number of other passengers, amongst whom are Mr Swainson, Chief Justice, and Mr Martin, Attorney-General, of the new colony, to which sations they have been recently appointed. The arrangements for the comfort of the emigrants on board were certainly very complete ; and it must be gratifying to know that those persons sent out by the company will be provided with a large proportion of their provisions fresh, a great quantity of patent preserved provisions being shipped for that purpose on board the Tyne. There are a greater number of children than usual in the Emigration Depot--many of the families consisting of from eight to twelve individuals. The Prince Rupert, which now lies in the London Dock, will clear out on the 10th inst ; and it is supposed she will pretty well clear the depot of its present inmates.-----------------------------------------------------------------New Zealand CompanyA very lively and interesting scene occurred on Friday, off the West India Dock entrance, at Blackwall, by the preparation for departure of three fine vessels with "improvers" for "Nelson," the second colony of New Zealand. The Directors of the Company and several hundred persons of rank and wealth met there to bid farewell to the enterprising emigrants, who appeared highly delighted with the honour extended to them, and in high spirits with the anticipations of the successful result of their mission. After viewing the arrangeents made for the comfort of all on board, the Directors returned to the West India Dock Tavern, where a sumptuous breakfast was provided in the large room. The Duke of Sussex took the chair, and was supported on the right by the Earl of Devon, and on the left by Jos. Somes, Esq., the Governor of the Company. Among the guests were the Duchess of Inverness, the Duke and Duchess of Somerset, Lords Cottenham, Sandon, Marcus Hill, Clements, Viscount Ebrington, M.P., the Hon. Frederick Dundas, Hon. Captain Drummon, Messrs P. Maxwell Stewart, M.P., Gowen, G. F. Young, W. C. Young, and the Misses Young; the Hon. Mrs Douglas, the Hon. Miss Petre, Rev, Dr Hinds, J. E. Boulcott, Captain Hine, Sir Robert and Lady Harland, Sir John Doxatt, M. D.; Mr, Mrs, and Miss Pennington; Lieutenant Lean, her Majesty's Emigration Agent; MEssrs Jordan, E. G. Wakefield, Dudley Costello, Mr and Mrs S. C. Brees, Captain Sinclair, R.N.,&c. &c. The rapid progress which the grand undertaking of colonizing New Zealand has made, was more than once alluded to by his Royal Highness and other distinguished speakers on both sides of politics, and its many advantages were dwelt upon with much sincerity of feeling. Several gentlemen of the first families go out with this expedition, which will be closely followed by several first-rate ships.-----------------------------------------------------------------Emigration to South Australia ( From Tuesday's Gazette.Colonial Land and Emigration Office, 9 Parkstreet, Westminster, Oct. 1, 1841.--In reference to the notice published in the Royal Gazette  of the 6th of August last, to the effect that all emigrants in respect of whom bounty was to be claimed in New South Wales, must have left this country by the 1st of November next, the Commissioners of Land and Emigration do hereby give further notice, in pursuance of directions from her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, that in order to prevent the consequences which must ensue if vessels should continue to be engaged until too late to be dispatched by the required date, no ships can be permitted to sail with a claim to bounty from the Colonial Government beyond those which shall be forthwith returned to the Commissioners of Colonial Lands and Emigration, and proved to be already under engagement for the purpose.--By order of the Board, John Gliddon, Assis.-Sec.-----------------------------------------------------------------Wellington, New Zealand, June 18.--( From a private letter. )--"Among the latest arrivals is Mr Swainson, F.R.S., the eminent naturalist, by the Jane, from London. He has purchased a house, and intends to reside here with his family. The Governor, Captain Hobson, is daily expected from Auckland on a visit to Colonel Wakefield, the company's agent. Several emigrant ships have lately reached us. The Katherine Stewart, Forbes, from London, has just entered the harbour."-----------------------------------------------------------------Emigration.--The following data will show the number of emigrants from the United Kingdom, with their destination, during the year 1840 derived from official sources:--To N. American Col. 27,025 To Van Diem. Land 281 United States 38,495 West Australia 233 West Indies 1,938 Port-Philip 3,201 Cape of G. Hope 513 South Australia 2,911 Sydney 7,811 New Zealand 1,330 Total 83,746-----------------------------------------------------------------Tailors.--In 1836 the number of tailors and slopmakers in the town was 500, and these were fully employed; at present there are only 250, and these but partially employed; leaving 250 who are unemployed. Some have left the town, and others are gone to America or Australia.-----------------------------------------------------------------Emigration.A Return, just published, shows that emigration is still proceeding upon a gigantic scale:--Emigrants from the United Kingdom in 1840. England. Scotland. Ireland. Total. To North American colonies, 5,303 3,053 23,935 32,293 United States, 35,309 1,246 4,087 40,0 Other parts of America, 44 ---- 44 West Indies, 745 687 159 1,591 The Cape, 315 8 -- 323 Australia and New Zealand, 14,495 817 538 15,850 56,213 5,811 28,719 90,743We have not the previous Returns at hand, but we believe that a larger number of emigrants never left the shores of the British Isles in one year than the above. It is startling to think, that 1800 persons quit the kingom every week never to return. The natural increase of the people must be about 1100 per day, of whom emigration carries off 250, leaving 850 to swell the Census.The emigration to our North American colonies was as follows:--To Canada, 21,209 --New Brunswick, 8,056 -- Newfoundland, 387 --Nova Scotia, 972 --Cape Breton, 437 Prince Edward's Island, 1,214 Hudson's Bay, 18 32,293To Australia it was:--Swan River, 224 South Australia, 2,748 Port Philip, 3,473 Sydney, 7, Van Diemen's Land, 299 14,392-----------------------------------------------------------------Theatre Royal.--The Pantomine, we observe, is postponed till Friday. Meanwhile, the theatre is crowded nightly, the public being admitted at second price from the commencement of the performances.Music Hall.--We stated, about two month ago, that, in connection with other improvements in the Assembly Rooms, a plan was under consideration for erecting a Music Hall. We are now happy to announce, that at a meeting of the proprietors of the Rooms last week, full pwers were given to the Directors to take the requisite steps for carrying the design into execution. The desire so long felt by the cultivators of music here, will soon be realisd, by the erection of a splendid hall, constructed with a due regard to the accommodation both of professional men and the public, and with a minute attention to the most recent improvements, by which full effect is secured to musical performances when conducted on a grand scale. By what may be called a propitious coincidence, Mr Bishop, the new Professor of Music, arrived in Edinburgh on the very day when this resolution was come to.Martin's Paintings.--The exhibition of these celebrated paintings in this city has already, we believe, attracted many visitors. They are truly wonderful creations, and possess a power and grandeur of which the engravings, so familiar to the public, convey but a faint conception. In contemplating " the Deluge," the spectator is so [?] [?] [?] the scene, that he is apt to overlook the details; but these will be found on inspection to be among the most interesting features of the picture. The groups of perishing beings are exquisitely wrought, while everything is made to contribute to the terrific grandeur of the catastrophe. The other two pictures--"Pandemonium" and "the Rivers of Bliss," are smaller in size, but equally indicative of the high poetic genius of the artist. Nothing could be more striking than the contrast these pictures present to each other--the one fearful beyond expression, the other exhibiting a heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the eye rests with delight. There are several other valuable paintings in this collection, amongst which is "The Offering Up of Isaac," a Rembrandt in fine preservation.Gordon's British Diorama.--This beautiful exhibition opened on Saturday last, and has, we understand, been crowded with visitors ever since. It will be seen by Mr Gordon's advertisement in to-day's paper, that the view of the Tower of London during the recent conflagration (to which we alluded in our last) has now arrived, and is being exhibited along with the other views.Broughton-place Congregation.--We understand that the call given by BroughtonPlace Congregation to the Rev. Mr Croon, Sanquhar, to be colleague to the Rev. Dr. Brown, has not been accepted, owing to the strong claims which the affectionate people among whom he presently labours have to continuance of his services, and his unfitness, as he alleges, for a charge so laborious; a result which, we learn, has caused among the members of Broughton-Place extreme and general regret.Cooke's Equestrian Amphitheatre, Leith.--Mr Cooke has generously handed over to the Provost, for the benefit of the Destitute Sick Society, the handsome sum of t15; being the free proceeds of Friday evening's entertainment, which took place under the patronage of the Provost and Magistrates.Captain Ross' Discoveries.--Extracts from Captain Ross' despatches have been published in a Parliamentary paper. From the map which accompanies the paper, we gain a more distinct idea of his track than the previous article copied from the Athenean[?]  afforded. South Victoria Land, which he discovered, extends in latitude from 70 1/2 south to 79, how much farther is unknown; and in longitude its eastern coast lies between 163 and 171. Its position is directly south from New Zealand, and at the distance of 1500 geographical miles. The length of the part seen was fully 500 miles. It was girt with a border of ice many miles in breadth, which rendered it inaccessible. The passage southward was closed at latitude 78 by a barrier of ice 150 feet high, which was traced for 300 miles east from Victoria Land. Icebergs were encountered in numbers after they passed parallel of 63, and pack ice at 66. The land " rose in lofy peaks from 9000 to 12,000 feet in height, perfectly covered with eternal snow; the glaciers  descended from near the mountain summits, project many miles into the ocean,  and presented a perpendicular face of lofty cliffs." They could not reach the mainland, but landed on an island, which they found to consist of volcanic rocks. On 28th January, in latitude 77 1/2, longitude 169 E., they discovered a magnificent volcano, emitting smoke and flame in a splendid profusion," and named it Mount Erebus. An extinct one near it was named after the other vessel, Mount Terror. At the distance of less than half a mile from the ice cliffs which barred their progress southward, they had soundings with 318 fathoms. These cliffs, no doubt, reached the bottom, and, including the 150 feet above water, must have had an elevation fo 2000 feet of thereabout. The observations on the dip and declination induced them to place the South Magnetic Pole in latitude 76, and east longitude 153; and they considered its position as well ascertained as if they had reached it, though their nearest approach to it was a point 160 miles from it, on the east coast of Victoria Land. The pole is probably within that region, though this cannot be positively affirmed, as its western boundary is unknown. The highest latitude they reached 78. 4. They were therefore only 12 degrees from the pole and about 4 degrees nearer to it than Captain Weddel[?], the most successful of their predecessors. The Non-intrusion Disclosures.--In the Advertiser  of yesterday there is a letter from J. M. Hog, Esq. of Newliston, and another from the Rev. Dr Simpson of Kirknewton, both expressing their extreme surprise at the letter of Mr Hamilton (which appeared in our last), and strongly disclaiming all connexion with it on the part of the General Assembly's Committee.Sabbath Observance--The Sweetie Case. --We understand that the Government of Prussia, thinking that the mode of keeping the Sabbath in that country was in some respects too lax, recently sent over a person to this country, to learn whether our practise in Britain would not furnish hints for improvement. Unluckily, the very first specimens of our piety which met him were the sweetie case, and that of the poor man Key who was excommunicated for burying his child on Sunday. These will of course figure in the very front of the officer's report as the natural fruits of our system, and we may guess what their effect will be in reconciling the Germans to a stricter observance of Sunday! We can, moreover, inform Butters' prosecutors, that the fame of their exploits has already travelled, by the aid of the Teutonic newspapers, to the uttermost parts of Germany, to the infinite amusement of the Swabian farmers, the Saxon miners, and the shepherds of the Riesengeberge. Key's case is no doubt destined to enjoy equal celebrity.Airdrie--Anti-Corn-Law Conference.--On Monday last, the members of the United Secession Church, Airdrie, favourable to a repeal of the Corn and Provision Laws, met, in compliance with the request of the Committee taking the active management of the Conference to be held in Edinburgh on the second week in January next on that subject, when they unanimously appointed their pastor, the Rev. Matthew M'Gavin, A.M., Mr John Craig Waddell, proprietor, and Mr James Forrester, merchant in Airdrie, to represent their sentiments at that meeting, which is looked forward to with great interest by the liberal portion of the inhabitants of the burgh. The Rev. Mr Taylor, with Messrs Adam Nimmo, contractor, and John Young, bookseller, will represent the Independent congregation; and Mr Thomas Muir, pastor of the Baptist church, will represent that body on that occasion.Kirkcudbright--Address to the Dean of Faculty,--We learn that at a meeting, held on the 17th current, of the Clerks and Procurators of the Steward and COmmissary Courts, an address was voted to Alexander Wood, Esq. on his appointment to the office of Dean of Faculty, and his retirement from that of Steward of Kirkcudbright.Distress in Paisley.--We understand that the Bookbinders of Edinburgh purpose to give a Grand Musical Melange in a few days, the proceeds of which are to be handed over to the committee for the distressed weavers in Paisley.Musselburgh.--Mr Wilson, Treasurer to the "Honest Town," has, by the hands of the district committeesm collected from the contributors to the Prince of Wales fund, nearly t100; and the committees have already distributed 130 tons of coals to the necessitous families in the neighbourhood.Presbytery of Dalkeith--Case of Mr Monroe.--This Presbytery met on Tuesday the 21st current. At a former meeting an agent appeared for Mr Monroe, presentee to Fala, and laid on the table of Presbytery a presentation in his favour to the parish of Fala. It having been objected that the presentation, and some other papers relative thereton, bore, that Mr Monroe was presented merely to the parish of Fala, and not to the united parishes of Fala and Soutra, the agent made his appearance again at the meeting, which was held on Tuesday, with a supplementary presentation, and also a letter acceptance from Mr Monroe. The agent, when asked, admitted that he had not with him a Presbyterial certificate; and he stated, that he would not ask the Presbytery to sustain the presentation with relative papers at that meeting. But he intimated, that he intended to appear at the next meeting, which is appointed to be held on the 22d of February, and he expected to be able to show that the Presbytery should then sustain the presentation and relative documents.Splendid Meteor.--On Tuesday evening, about eight o'clock, a meteor of unusal size and splendour was witnessed in this quarter. The evening was very clear, the sky being without a cloud, and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly, a dazzling blaze of light burst from the sky, illuminating Benlomond and the distant hills, the Curse around Craigforth, and, indeed, the earth and air on every side as far as the eye could reach, with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The phenomenon appeared like a ball of fire, of an oblong shape, and apparently almost twice the size of the moon, having at the time somewhat of the same silvery appearance as that luminary, but flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to dazzle the eyes. A tail of fire somewhat resembling that of a rocket, but composed of the most beautifully varied colours, streamed behind it for a short distance, adding much to its spendour, and giving the whole an appearance at once singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it disappeared, it assumed a red glowing appearance, and then burst for an instant enveloping the earth and sky in a blaze as bright and dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared to pass from the south to the north, inclining towards the earth. To the eye it seemed to burst and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another meteor of the same kind, but much less in size, brilliancy, and splendour, was observed falling in a quartr rather farther to the south, a few minutes previously. It is a coincidence worthy of notice, that a meteor, of the same nature with that first described in the above, was seen at the same hour in Glasgow.--Stirly Journal.Glasgow.--The collection made on Sabbath afternoon last, by the Rev. Mr Macfarlane's congregation, Nicholson Street, Glasgow, amounted to t46, 7s. 6d. This sum is the more praiseworthy when it is considered that this congregation has within a few months subscribed among themselves nearly t1000 for the erection of their beautiful place of worship to be called "Erskine Church," of which they are erelong to take possession.The Unemployed in Paisley.--The number of unemployed in Paisley has last week decreased by 43. In Kilbarchan and Barrhead they were still on the increase. The following is the official report of yesterday for Paisley and Barrhead :--Paisley. Males, 1865 Dependants, 4662 --6527 Females, 1680 Dependants, 3360 --5040 Total, 11,567 Barrhead. December 17, 287 ... 23, 346 Increase, 59 --Paisley Advertiser.The Paisley Manufacturing Committee. --This Committee continue to carry on their operations with energy and zeal. The amount of the fund now exceeds t8000, and is still on the increase. They have given out about 700 webs already, and are as busy as possible preparing more. Unable to get a sufficiency of webs warped in Paisley, they have sent for assistance in this respect both to Glasgow and Johnstone. A good deal of work has this week been given to warpers, winders and heddle-casters. They have taken much more spacious premises in Gilmour Street, in order that they may the more easily supply both town and country weavers. It is desirable that the implement fund should be somewhat enlarged, as the other funds of the Committee are not trenched on for that purpose --Ibid.Ducal Generosity.--After the late county meeting at Hamilton, at which addresses were voted to the Queen and Prince Albert, his Grace the Duke of Hamilton and several of those who had attended the meeting visited the jail. One respectable looking female attracted his Grace's attention; and on inquiry he was told that she was the widow of a respectable wood merchant, now deceased, and had been confined for upwards of a year, at the instance of a law agent in Edinburgh, for costs incurred in a suit in the Court of Session. His Grace immediately caused the truth of the poor woman's story to be investigated, and on being satisfied of the facts he caused the debt to be paid by his factor, and procured the woman's liberation, who has thus through his Grace's generosity been restored to liberty and to the superintendence of her young family.--Reformers' Gazette.Presentation.--A number of the members of the United Secession Church, Airdrie, met in their vestry on the evening of Wednesday the 22d inst. when Councillor Brown, in name of the congregation, presented the Rev. M. M'Gavin, A.M., their pastor, with a handsome pulpit gown and cassock, as a mark of their respect and esteem; after which a number of the influential members of the congregation entertained him to supper supper in Mr Witherspoon's King's Arms Inn--Mr Daniel Gray, collector, Coltness Railway, in the chair, and Dr Clarkson, croupier--when the evening was spent in the most friendly, happy, and intellectual manner.A Rescue.--Last week, while the Duke of Hamilton was riding along the wood leading from Hamilton to Bothwell, he heard the screams of a female, and on looking towards the place whence the cries came, he perceived a stout Irishman belabouring a woman in a most unmerciful style. No sooner did he observe this, than he rode up to the scene of cruelty, dismounted from his horse, knocked the savage down, rescued the woman, and sent her home rejoicing, with more money in her pocket than it may have been her lot to possess for a long time. When we recollect that his Grace was born so long ago as October 1767, and so is in his 75th year, we cannot sufficiently admire his gallantry, humanity, and intrepidity--Glasgow Chronicle.Town Council.--The usual meeting of Council did not take place yesterday in consequence of the Christmas holidays.House of Industry.--We understand that Miss Grace Bailie had left a legacy to the Edinburgh House of Industry of ten pounds sterling.Old Church.--The Lords of her Majesty's Treasury have officially intimated to the parties interested their intention to adhere to the original arrangement made with the Town Council, for altering the Assembly Aisle, and rendering it fit to be permanently used as a place of worship for the accomodation of one of the city congregations.Prince of Wales Fund.--In the table of sums subscribed in the different Wards of Police, published in our paper of Saturday last, that indicated for the 26th Ward was t120, 12s. 9d. Mr Lindores, the General Commissioner, requests us to state, that the sum subscribed in his Ward was t275, 12s. 9d., and that the difference between the two sums is the amount of the very handsome subscriptions by the Banks in St Andrew Square, and which were drawn by the Treasurer.Presentation of Plate.--On Friday afternoon, about fifty citizens entertained Mr William Donaldson, of the Albion Cloth Company, to an elegant dinner and dessert, in the Turf Hotel, Princes Street, for the purpose of presenting him with a testimonial of their esteem, subscribed for by the members of the Celtic Lodge, and other private friends. Mr William Wright, hat manufacturer, was in the chair, supported on the right and left by the guest of the evening, Mr Pritchard of the Theatre-Royal, and other gentlemen. Mr Dick of the Albion officiated as croupier. After the usual loyal and preliminary toasts had been given, the chairman called for a bona fide  bumper for the toast of the evening, and, after passing a handomse eulogium on those various qualities of their guest which had endeared him to all his friends, neighbours, and acquaintances, far and wide, presented to Mr Donaldson, in the name of the subscribers, a very elegant and massive silver tea set, of the value of t50. Mr Donaldon's health was then proposed and drunk with warm and friendly enthusiasm. The presentee replied to the compliment in modest and appropriate terms. The company spent an exceedingly happy and convivial night; the chairman and croupier taking care that there should be no flagging in the jovialty. The toasts were suitable to the occasion. Mr Mackenzie's instrumental band played appropriate airs to the various toasts and sentiments; and vocal music, from amateurs, was never wanting; the guest himself being a host in that department. The following inscription is neatly engraved on the various pieces of playe :--"To Mr William Donaldson, R.W.M. of the Lodge Celtic of Edinburgh and Leith, from a number of Masonic and other Friends.--24th Dec. 1841."Theft and Recovery of a Pony.--At a late hour on Sunday night a gentleman residing in the southern part of the town dismounted from his pony at his own gate, and proceeding inwards, leaving the animal to follow, as he was wont to do, to the stable. On looking about, he observed a young man, whom he supposed to be his son, take the reins and mount the pony. Shortly afterwards the son came into the house, and the question of "Where is the pony?" soon convinced the parties that it was stolen. They immediately proceeded in search, and while the gentleman was giving information at the Police-Office, his son discovered the pony with a rider on the North Bridge. He immediately seized the reins and made a clutch at the thief; but the latter very adroitly threw himself off at the opposite side, ran down the Fleshmarket stairs, and escaped.Providential Recovery.--One day last week, a fine little child, about five years of age, belonging to one of the villagers at Ratho, having dandered[?] away with another little play-fellow, like himself, to a little distance from the house, fell into a deep well. His companion was found standing weeping at the edge. The apparently dead body of the little one being got out, was taken home, and all hopes of its recovery given up, when Dr Pringle, and excellent young gentleman, who is presently assistant of Dr Craig at Ratho, made his appearance, and, by applying himself with indefatiguable perseverance, succeeded in recalling the apparently extinguished spark. The next the little romp was as lively as ever.Mungo Park.--A public meeting was held in the town hall of Selkirk, on Monday the 26th current, the Chief Magistrate in the chair; when various resolutions were adopted with the view of erecting a monument or other permanent mark of respect for the memory of this celebrated traveller.Thimble-Riggers.--A band of thimble-riggers from Edinburgh have for several weeks past been infesting the roads in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. They are six in number and one of them, an old man of rather respectable appearance, is generally in advance of the party, and having got into conversation with a passenger on the road, and the others running up, and desiring the old man to try his luck; he does so, and winning a trifle, he easily persuades the person with whom he has been ingratiating himself to try also, and he is soon robbed of his whole spare cash. Information having, on Wednesday last, been given to the Procurator-Fiscal at Pollokshaws, and the gang were on the new Kilmarnock Road, he immediately despatched two rural police officers in pursuit of them. On the officers coming up to the gang, they separated and ran off, but the officers captured two of them (the old man and another), who were safely lodged in Pollokshaws Jail; and having been brought before two of the Justices, and several person having sworn to being defrauded by them of their money, they were sentenced tothirty days' imprisonment in Paisley House of Correction, with hard labour, as rogues and vagabonds; and an active look-out is made by the police for the remainder of the gang.Stoppage of Payments by the Town of Paisley.--Partly on account of the great depression of trade, and partly on account of a run raised by the circulation of malicious and false statements regarding the affairs of the community of Paisley, theTown Council, at a meeting on Wednesday evening, ordered the Chamberlain to susspend receipt or payment of deposits, in the meantime, but to proceed with all possible despatch in realizing the outstanding debts due to the community for the regular payment of the interest on the money borrowed, and other current engagements of the burgh. It is pretty generally known that a small portion of the would-be-political leaders of the town who have not the influence to get themselves placed in municipal authority, have for a good number of years endeavoured to embarass the party in power, by attacking the credit of the community. The unfavourabout state of trade and the leniency of the Council in not enforcing during the last year the exactions on the owners of property, for entries, &c. falling due, caused a deficiency of nearly t300 in the usual amount of revenue. This simple circumstance was taken advantage of, though nothing was lost thereby, and statements prejudicial to the town's credit were placed in the hands of every credito that could be found by the individuals referred to, and thus uncalled for alarm raised. In addition to this, the adherents of the same party in the Council during the last five days gave currency to another statement which they knew to be quite untrue, about the late Provost having commenced to secure himself by drawing a thousand pounds, when the fact was he had not drawn out a penny. From the position to which which the affiars the town are now driven a full and public exposure of these matters will soon be submitted to the creditors. The Council have been negotiating for such a loan of money as will pay off those who are dissatisfied, which in the ordinary state of the money market they would long since have obtained, though at present that is difficult. As regards risk to the creditors, from the best informed quarters we are assured there is none. More than one-third of the whole debts of the town are due to the Bank and the members of Council, or their immediate friends, and fully a half of the debt against the river is due to the same parties. This we should conceive the strongest proof that could be adduced of the confidence of those who should best know the state of the town's affairs.--Glasgow Chronicle.Disgraceful Trick.--At a late wake in the country, a short way from Crieff, a waggish fellow tied a cord secretly to the neck of the corpse and while a number of young men and women present were going on merrily with some sport the wag pulled the cord, when corpse started up in the bed, making the clothes to fly off; the whole party rushed to the door, crying for mercy upon them, and knocking each other over in the hurry, when at length some people came to their assistance, who afterwards discovered the cause of their terror.--Perth Courier.The Church Question.--Long ago, Dr Chalmers let out the secret of the clerical movement, by declaring that very little of Non-intrustion would satisfy him and his friends, provided the independent power of the Church were secured. Now, this liberum arbitrium  does nothing at all for Non-intrusion; but it does a great deal for Church Independence. It confers no privilege on the laity; but it adds immeasurably to the power of the clergy. It is, in fact, the very worst part of the claims that have been advanced by the Church; and its effects would simply be to sacrifice the lay Non-intrusionists on the one hand, and clerical Moderates on the other. It means literally uncontrolled power to the Church The  General Steam Navigation Company's ship Monarch, Captain Fraser, arrived at Granton from London on Monday evening at half-past nine o'clock.Election of a Minister for Old Monk- land.--The election of a minster took place at Old Monkland Church, on Thursday the 23d inst., and the right of patronage being vested in the Heritors and Kirk-Session, the election might be considered a popular one. About 150 voters attended the meeting, and a decided wish having been expressed by, it is understood, the whole of the heritors that no candidate known to be connected with the Non-intrusion party in the Church should be chosen, the meeting, acting upon this principle, unanimously agreed to elect the Rev. Mr Johnston, Greenock, as minister of the parish. Considering the number of voters, the unanimity that prevailed among the electors, it is believed, is without precedent and stongly marks the sentiments and feelings of a large and very populous parish on the present proceedings of the dominant party in th Church. Mr Johnston was proposed by General Pye Douglass of Rosehall, seconded by Mr M'Caul of Daldowie, and unanimously elected.--Reformers' Gazette.Destructive Fire.--About three o'clock on the morning of the 25th curt., an alarm of fire was given at Balmangan Mill, in the parish of Rerwick. The premises are occupied by Mr Kissock, and despite the great exertions of himself, servants and neighbours, the work of destruction proceeded with a degree of rapidity that rendered it impossible to save a single article. The flames in their fury having charred the rafters, the roof fell in with a loud crash; and, before long, the entire mill, with the exception of the side walls, became an unbroken mass of ruins. The building contained a considerable quantity of grain and oatmeal, the property of the tacksman, all of which was unforunately destroyed. As the premises were found quite safe a very few hours previously, suspicion of incendiarism have naturally arisen, but no clue thus far has been found attaching guilt to a single individual. The fire, if wilful, implies the blackest malice, and it is sad to think that any one could have been so wicked as to destroy what thousands are in want of, and would gladly toil for, if they only knew how--daily bread--Dumfries Courier.Hamilton.--Some influential persons in Hamilton and the neighbourhood have subscribed to build an Episcopal chapel in that town. We have been informed that all the requisite arrangements have been made for carrying the views of the subscribers into effect. This is one effect of the conduct of the rebellious majority of the General Assembly. Many of thsoe now friendly to the scheme, never dreamed of espousing Episcopacy, till they have been driven in disgust from the Church of their fathers, by the conduct of their ministers; men who exist in their offices by law, and yet set that very law at defiance, in virtue of which they hold offices, and draw their "temporalities," as they cantingly term their good things, which alone induce some of them, at least, to remain members of the venerable Establishment. Who would have believed, some years ago, that "Black Prelacy" was about to be established within sight of Bothwell Brigg!-----------------------------------------------------------------Another New Field for Emi grationThe Falkland Islands  have been nominally a British colony for some years; but, in consequence of representations made to Government by various persons interested in the trade to the South Seas, a plan has at least been drawn up for establishing a body of settlers in these islands. It was submitted to the late Ministers, who referred it to the Commissioners of Emigration and the Lords of the Admiralty, by both of whom it was approved. Rules were prepared by the Commissioners of Emigration ; a vote of t3750 was put into the estimates for the first year's expense, and, we suppose, passed. If steps have not been taken already to send out emigrants, we presume they will be taken about the beginning of next winter, which is their summer.These islands are about 300 miles from the south extremity of the American continent, in a latitude corresponding with that of London. Their climate, however, very closely resembles that of Shetland. They have cold summers and mild winters. Snow seldom lies in them; but owing to their humidity and want of sunshine, and the stormy winds which blow almost constantly, wheat of barley could not be raised in them, and even oats might turn out to be a precarious crop. It is doubted also if wood will grow, and at present there is not a single tree in the islands. Turnips and potatoes succeed well, and there is an abundance of good grass, upon which some thousands of black cattle, horses, and hogs, thrive in the wild state, and sheep have been introduced and found to do well. Extensive peatbogs exist, which will afford a sufficient supply of fuel. The present population consists of twentyfive persons, young and old--one-half of them British, the other Gauchos, South American Indians of a semi-civilised description. They are all stationed at Port-Louis, a fine natural harbour, where a British officer resides.The islands are numerous, but all very small except two, whose area is estimated at 13,000 square miles, or nearly half the extent of Scotland. They are deeply perforated by arms of the sea, and probably afford a greater number of fine natural harbours than any country of equal extent in the world. Their shores afford excellent fish of many kinds, and seals are exceedingly numerous.The great object in establishing a colony here is to provide a harbour of refuge and place of refitment for our ships frequenting the South Seas, which are yearly increasing in number. Every vessel going to the Pacific Ocean, or coming from it, passes within sight of these islands, or near them. At present 60 or 70 British ships pass these islands annually coming from Chili or Peru, and 20 more engaged in the whale fishery. The trade to New South Wales employs 236 vessels, most of which return to England by this route, which will also be preferred by vessels trading to New Zealand, Van Diemen's Land, Port Philip, and probably South Australia. From Sydney or Hort Town the distance is nearly the same by Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope, but the prevalence of westerly winds in the parallel beyond the 30th, renders the latter route the more advantageous on the outward voyage, and the former on the return. The Falkland Islands are about half as distant from Britain as New South Wales.The Emigration Board recommend that Government should send out two surveyors to select an eligible site for a town, and to lay out the land in blocks of half a square mile, which may be subdivided. It is proposed to sell the land to emigrants at 12s. per acre, and to expend part of the money in carrying out additional settlers, part in defraying the colonial outlay. There are 40,000 wild cattle in the largest island, the privilege of shooting which, or catching and taming them, might be sold to the settlers or a company. The climate is uninviting, but there is little doubt that persons accustomed to grazing or sheep farming, or to sealhunting, or deep-sea fishery, might drive a profitable trade here. A vast number of ships, making long voyages, American, French, Dutch, as well as British, pass the islands, and to these it would be a great accommodation to find supplies of provisions and the means of refitting here. Some of our starving population in the North of Scotland or the Islands, might better their circumstances by removing to the Falkland Islands.-----------------------------------------------------------------New Zealand.( From the Morning Chronicle..The dinner given on Saturday by the New Zealand Company to Lord John Russell will serve to remove all apprehensions, if any are yet entertained, with regard to the relations between that colony and the Government of the parent state. Many of the first names in the country honoured this splendid banquet by their presence ; and men of all parties, Tories, Whigs, and Radicals, appeared to be actuated only by one common feeling.The public are now tolerably familiar with the natural advantages of New Zealand, which appears destined to be in the Souther Ocean what Great Britain is in the Northern. Lord Ashburton, with must felicity, observed, " that the position of the New Zealand islands on the map, their climate, fertility, abundant harbours surrounded with the seas most suited to the whale fisheries, and, above all, the character to the native population, led him to anticipate that these islands were likely to become the great seat of wealth and naval power." Lord John Russell was justly complimented, on all hands, for adding these important islands to the great colonial empire of this country.The speech of Lord John Russell was much and deservedly applauded."I believe," said his lordship, "that the foundation of this colony of New Zealand will tend to the honour and dignity of the Crow, and will tend to the prosperity and future greatness of the nation (cheers). It was on this ground, and for these reasons, that I lent my humble efforts in support of those exertions that had been made, and were about to be made, by the New Zealand Company. Gentlemen, in so doing, I should be unworthy of your approbation if I took any extraordinary merit to myself ; for, in the first place, the principle of colonization, the value of colonies to this country, the means they afford of augmenting her strength, of adding to her power, of promoting her wealth, and of increasing her prosperity--all this has been ascertained and demonstrated by the enlightened discussions of past years (hear, hear). With regard to the best mode of colonization, likewise, we have had the advantage and assistance of the most enlightened opinions, and the most adverse discussion I, therefore, can only take to myself the merit of not being blind to the importance and value of those opinions and discussions (hear, and cheers)"But though his lordship speaks thus humbly of his own merits, in recommending the adoption of these islands by the Crown, it was perfectly well understood by all present that, for his conduct with respect to his colony, he has truly entitled himself to the gratitude of his country. Lord Ashburton only paid him a deserved tribute when he complimented him for the sagacity with which he had appreciated the importance of these islands, so soon as he had entered on the administration of colonial affairs, and for the judicious measure of setting up the British flag in them.We may observe that the health of her Majesty's Ministers, proposed by Mr Hutt, M.P., was received with loud and universal cheering, and that Mr Labouchere's speech, which was a very good one, was well received. Upon the whole, Lord John's visit to the City on this occasion is calculated to gain the Government favour among the commercial classes. His lordship may well be proud, that though New Zealand was formally taken possession of in the name of the Sovereign of this country many years ago, it was reserved for him to make it a British colony.-----------------------------------------------------------------
