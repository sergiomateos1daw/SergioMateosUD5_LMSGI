extract of a letter the population of canada in was reckoned at souls whilst her exports had never exceeded two millions of livres tournois about l the imports must have greatly exceeded the exports but not even a conjecture of the differences can be formed the present population of the canadas may be rated at souls but great as this augmentation may appear commerce will be found to have greatly surpassed the proportional ratio of the population from to the exports may have varied from l to l chiefly of wheat furs and peltry but during the last years they have increased to the surprising sum of l s sterling as we shall presently perceive by the following estimate which cannot be much over or under the truth furs and skims wheat all other grain flour and biscuit lumber of all descriptions pot and pearl ashes beets and pork sundries too tedious to particularise the hulls masts and yards of ves sels built in the province total of domestic produce sundry goods imported and exported commissions and additional charges at per cent sterling t the amounts of imports of dutiable articles at quebec is about l sterling it is impossible to ascertain the value of goods not dutiable but we may safely conlude that they will make the total of import as one million sterling leaving a balance in favour of these provinces which but a few years ago would have appeared incredible this property is carried by vessels whose tonnage is navigated by seamen the freight and primage on these vessels are nine guineas per ton being l s sterling which without taking into consideration the charges in britain will make the gross amount of our cargoes landed exceed l sterling being about a tenth of the imports of the united kingdom our commerce has become considerable with the united states a few years ago our imports from thence greatly exceeded our exports but since respectable and intelligent american merchants have begun to settle amongst us i believe the scale turned in our favour and thus british industry is commencing to run in a channel never before much thought of the ship nestor belonging to glasgow seized several months ago by the officers of his majesty's customs at this port for not being provided with a register according to act of parliament was condemned at a court of vice admiralty held in spanish town on friday last week she was sold for l this morning some dispatches were received from boston which were brought over in the sally capt walker from liverpool they are dated the th november and contain an account of the arrival of several ships from newfoundland and some from halifax that provisions of all kinds were very plentiful and reasonable our latest accounts from the west indies say that no supply from the islands either of wheat or flour can possibly be obtained from the american states in consequence of the great bounties given by his most christian majesty on these articles our charity therefore if we have any of these articles to spare must be first extended to our own colonies and we cannot be surprised particularly when we consider the present price of bread at home that no assistance can be given at present either to the french or dutch the crops in the island of jamaica promise a most plentiful harvest except to the eastward which ahs generally been considered as the most productive part by the westmoreland just arrived from jamaica we learn that the slaves have become mutinous to an alarming degree ever since they were made acquainted with the intended abolition of the slave trade extract of a letter from quebec june we are dreadfully alarmed at present on account of the great scarcity of flour throughout the province common flour sold this morning in the market at six dollars per cwt bran from s d to s oats s per bushel and pease d per bushel there has been an account taken of the quantity of flour and wheat in this city and liberties by order of the governor and council and we find there is not more than will serve as ten days they ar much worse off in the district of montreal than we are here we have sent them frequent supplies wheat which was found too bad to be shipped last year at three livres now sells at two dollars one merchant will make upwards of fifteen hundred pounds by this job government for the relief of the poor have caused to be issued by the contractor here rise at d per lb no one to get more than a dollar's worth at a time the day before yesterday there was delivered above a hundred pounds worth in this way in consequence of letters by last thursday's post from montreal two thousand bushels of damaged wheat were shipped yesterday for that market we have not had a grain of flour from england or the states though we hear of a cargo from new york for montreal the vessel was to call at new brunswick and it is more than probably that people there being in great want themselves have detained her the government have done now what they should have done five or six months ago and then we should not be in this starving condition that is we are to have a proclamation to permit the importation of grain and flour from the states my servant is just come home from the baker's where i had sent him for half a dollar's worth of bread after watching for two hours till the bread came out of the overn he could get but eighteenpennyworth three small loaves indeed weighing only two pounds each thirtyfive shillings have been paid for ship biscuit the lord knows what will become of us—except government will distribute some of the flour that is come for the troops in the queen mr davidson one of the council assured us on thursday last there was not wheat and flour in the country for five weeks he has taken a great deal of pains to be well informed on the subjuct and to him are we indebted for the proclamation to allow the importation from the states he stood forth alone and offered at his own expence to get an account taken of the quantities of wheat and flour in the town and liberties of quebec and insisted on its being taken into consideration cent is the only coinage the americans have of their won no less than ton of them were contracted for by congress in the year to be coined at the rate of ton per annum the contracters were also bound down to make them all of the famous jersey copper they are a little larger than the british halfpence no british copper no passes in the united states—silver and gold coins of all nations however pass current the congress have not yet ordered a silver coinage extract of a letter from a gentleman in bermuda tohis friend in norfolk virginia dated april by captain gilbert the bearer of this you will learn our distress for want of provi sions there has not been in the whole island one bushel of corn for sale for days past capt george from baltimore brought in days ago two bushels of corn which sold immeddiately at s d per bushel he also brought in barrels of flour common and superfine which sold at eight and nine dollars per barrel no vessel has arrived here with provisions since capt george and no vessel belonging to the island is expected to relieve us a great number of poor people have been for ten days past obliged to live on the greens of the field governor hamilton by advice of his counsel has opened the port of bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever for thirty days to be computed from the th day of march laden with bread corn or flour he also allows for three months the importation of salted provisions from any foreign port whatever in vessels belonging to these islands it is said what if any foreign vessel should come here after the time permited by proclamation they will be allowed to dispose of their cargo if they can prove they set out with an intent to come here if any vessels be ready to sail from norfolk with provisions advise them to call at bermuda the following extract from a late publication entitled a state of the present government of the province of quebec will give the public some idea of the canada bill which has been so much talked of an procrastinated so long and at present pending in parliament the work we understand to be the production of adam lymburner esq set over by the province to negotiate this afair it is remarkablewithhis former publication for its strong nervous elocution and perspicuity of reasoning liberty is congenial to the feelings of all mankind the security which flows from a free constitution to both political and civil liberty contributes greatly towards bringing forth the powers of the human mind and the encouragement of the industry of people but no constitution can be called free where the people are not allowed to participate of the legislative authority by their representatives this is the great criterion of freedom and it is extremely natural for all british subjects as they know the value of it to struggle for such a valuable right great britain has constantly acknoledged this principle in the constitution she has granted to all her colonies and by that means has rendered them more flourishing and prosperous than those of other nations although the inhabitants of the province of quebec have from the general tendency of the british government to a mild administration enjoyed a certain degree of civil liberty yet they have been from the peculiar nature of the system of their government entirely deprived of all political liberty a more full enjoyment of these essential privileges has been the prayer of their petitions and of those now before the house of commons the objects prayed for may be reduced to the following heads— an elective house of assembly or representatives of the people that the members of the legislative council receive no salaries as counsellors that the habeas corpus act and the other laws of england relating to personal libertybe made a part of the constitution that trial by jury in civil causes be likewise made part of the constitution and that nine out of twelve may return a verdict that the ancient laws and customs of canada relative to landed property marriage settlements inheritance and dowers be continued in force in the districts or curious anecdote—a few days ago a stranger waited on mr sibbly treasurer of the east india company and desired to speak to him in private when the were retired the stranger said to mr sibbly i am lately returned from india i have smuggled goods to the amount of about l what duty have i to pay upon them mr sibbly smiled and told him that he could receive no such money without the chairman's permission pray then said the stranger speak to him of it as soon as possible i am resolved to pay whatever the duty is the company pays for the exclusive privilege of bringing india goods to europe the man that deprives them of any part of the advantages they hope to reap from it cannot in my opinion look upon himself as a strictly honest man since the stranger waited on mr sibbly the chairman had not had time to give him an answer the stranger notwithstanding gave him a letter including a bank note of l the sum mr sibbly told him he should pay if he paid any thing extract of a letter from india by the dublin east indiaman to mr william jones we left patia dec and went to decca and arrived there after a passage of days just as we arrived there was a famine and it was really a shocking sight to behold you could not move out of your house but the corpses lay in your way and the wild dogs and jackalls were eating them at noonday the hindoos never bury their dead but burn them to ashes if they can afford it if not throw them into the river i have lately seen a man brought to the river side and laid down at lowwater mark before he was dead and when the the tide flowed it carried him off if a man woman or child dies at night the corpse is eaten by the morning this i have been an eye witness of for as i always rode out on horseback every morning i had an opportunity of seeing more than those that did not in the course of six months i became so much used to it that i took no notice of it i was there when a dreadful conflagration took place and burnt upwards of seven miles without intermission and many souls perished now consider first an inundation second a famine and third a conflagration how much the place must be distressed i leave you to think i left decca the st of december last and arrived at calcutta after a passage through the sunderburns in days hearty and well thank god the old system of sending men of rank to govern jamaica seems to be revived and laudably too this island is the most important possession we hold in the west indies and is well entitled to any mark of distinction which the parent country can bestow upon it the salary and emoluments annexed to the government of jamaica render it the most valuable of any in the king's gift except that of ireland soon after the restoration o'brian third earl of inchiquin was appointed governor of jamaica and died in his government henry bentinck first duke of portland was made governor of this island in the reign of george i his grace died at spanish town july th in the th year of his age the death of these two noblemen in their government gave so bad an impression of the climate of jamaica and the insalubrity of its air that few persons of rank and fortune have been ambitious of becoming governors of it notwith standing the brilliancy of the appointments an nexd to the situation a letter from the bay of honduras dated may says the spaniards who pay an annual visit to this settlement to prevent en croachments are destroying all the cultivated spots on shore alleging that the settlers are prohibited by the convention from cultivation of any kind this will prove a temporary misfortune to the woodcutters by depriving them of the principal means of subsisting their negroes and might be productive of mischief were it not that the british superintendant colonel despar with the assistance of the calypso sloop of war keeps the woodcutters in order this may rise the price of mahogany at home and certainly will raise provisions here extract of a letter form philadelphia dated th may i have travelled through several of the states and see no appearance of the poverty which you hear so much boast of in britain—every where i meet rather with extravagance indeed they procure too easily to be frugal in their outgivings all the manufactured goods imported from europe are from britain and they cannot have goods equal in quality and price from any other place i think i never say so many children as are in this country every town village and farmhouse are full of them—the people of this country increase like rabbits it is supposed they double their numbers every fifteen years but i should think they do it in a shorter period—what a grand prospect for the sale of british goods for when so many hundreds of millions of acres of land lye idle to be granted or purchased at a small price the people of this country never will manufacture at present wages are high and acres of land in the back settlements may be purchased for as many pence government are now engaging tons of transports on contract to carry over the felons under sentence of transportation to botany bay the victualling the convicts on the voyage is included in the contract from quebec june we are informed canada is at present greatly distressed provisions extremely dear beef if good for any thing per pound mutton —d butter d the parishes in the upper country about niagara and montreal have been without bread for four months there are orders now in town for as many goods for quebec as will load ten ships the trade being so exceedingly brisk and the people giving the preference to european goods lord m'donald to his great honour adopted a most liberal plan of establishing at his own expence not only one but a number of freevillages on his extensive domains by this plan proposed to his lordship by mr fraser the settlers are to have perpetual feus of the lands subject to a very moderate quit rent his lordship will by this means prevent the threatened emigrations to america and deserve the highest praises of his country yesterday some dispatches were received from st kitt's which were brought over in the matthew capt slegg arrived in the downs which are dated the th of june they contain an account of all the merchant ships which were then at that island that they were nearly full and were fixed to sail from thence the th of july and the first of august and that the weather continued exceedingly fine a short description of and remarks upon a new state called the western territory being one of four settled by the americans since t hat no nation can serve the americans with goods equal in quality and price to britain is wha the whole world knows and from experience the most obstinate rebel american dare not deny it is with pleasure therefore we inform our readers that the united states are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures—they have already laid out four new states since the beginning of their rebellion viz vermont kentucky indiana and the western territory about seventeen years ago vermont was a wilderness they only began to settle it about the year kentucky ten years ago lay in forest wild it was settled in yet so rapid has been the population that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants already in each of these states the state of indiana was only laid off this present year in and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants from a description of these four states published in america in may last we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them called the western territory and it must rerejoice the heart of every briton to read it and think that the settling of these countries though the americans double their numbers every or years will long keep them from manufacturing and is every day opening a field for new customers to great britain for who will work as a tradesman even though wages are very high when he can for twenty pounds purchase a thousand acres of land that being the present price fixed by congress for lots of land in the western territory—hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of america—desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect that new channels of commerce will be opened and the inland parts of the continent will require an increasing supply—british manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that continent and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation will be diffused through a country more fertile more extensive than all the thirteen united states the western territoryis the name given to this new state by congress it is bounded on the west by the mississippi river —north by the lakes—east by pennsylvania south and southeast by the ohio river contains according to mr hutchins geographer general to the congress square miles equal to two hundred and sixtythree millions of acres from which he deducts forththree millions of acres for water there will then remain two hundred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the fed—ral government which is to be sold for the discharge of the debt owing to the united states but a very small proportion of these lands is yet purchased of the native indians and disposed of by congress* on the lands which have been purchased by congress from the indians two settlements are already commenced—one at marietta the other at miami this state was only laid out by congress in the end of the year and already contains above inhabitants the principal rivers are the mississippi ohio muskingham hockhocking sioto miami wobash&c—coal and iron mines and salt pits abound in this state the soil is excellentas rich as can be imagined and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour it is exceedingly healthy pleasant and commodious—the most fertile spot of earth known to the europeans or americans—exceeding the soil of any of the united states the timber is tall and in great varietystreams for mills abound here wheat indigo hemp and cotton thrive well many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties and fulfill the description of travellers who call it the garden of the world it is here probably also that the center of a great empire will be fixed in some future period it is the most centrical place for congress to accommodate themselves at no country is better stocked with wild game of every kind herds of deers elks bears &c fill the extensive meadows of thie countryturkies geese swans and partridges &c are innumerable the rivers are excellently stored with fish and almost all navigable for small sloops in the ordinance published by congress for the government of this territory they are to be allowed an assembly when their number amounts to persons and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in congress and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into states rejoice o britons that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you and you only * no more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives for which congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum there are no less than women going out in the transports to botany bay among the female convicts destined for this settlement there was one so beautiful that it was thought a pity to send her abroad and she is therefore preferred for home cultivation [ continued from our last] carlisle july o n saturday last between three and four o'clock p m happened the most violent hurricane pest or thunder storm for we are at a lost to determine its proper name that was ever known in this borough or its vicinity we can conceive of nothing but an earthquake that could be attended with more alarming circumstances the cloud from the west or rather a number of clouds of a lowering aspect furiously agitated broken and seemingly ready to fall—attracted the attention and prepared the mind in some measure for what was to follow the lightening appeared to those who were at a distance remarkably red and seemed to flash from the cloud to the earth and back again in quick succession or some time as to appear one sheet of flame this might have had a great effect on the air at some miles distance from town to set it in rapid motion especially when pressed down by a heavy cloud suddenly falling towards the earth a very considerable quantity of hail fell and the rain was so abundant that it seemed as thrown from buckets and being carried along and dashed against every opposing object by a most impetuous wind darkened the air in such a manner that all surrounding objects seemed lost in night the storm threatened to lay the whole town in ruins with such irresistible force did the column of air move on happily however the damages were much less than apprehended the the new brick house belonging to the rev dr davidson being an an elevated spot near the west end of the town and lying directly in the line of march of this powerful column was the first sufferer all the parts of the building above the square were suddenly borne off and a great part of the roof was carried over mr paton's house which stood at a small distance on the east striking it forcibly and injuring it greatly in its ways and fell on the adjoining lot mr paton's house is left in much the same condition as the doctor's after injruing some smaller buildings in its course to the eastward the next elevated object to which it pointed its fury was the presbyterian church in the certain of town—a building of uncommon solidity calculated it was thought to stand for ages admist all the war of the elements about a fourth part however of the roof of the north side was carried off with the weighty cornice and thrown to the ground at some hundred yards distance on the east side of the open square which is in the centre of this borough after leaving the town it beat its course to the public buildings and greatly injured that range nearest the town many fences in the neighbourhood which were in the line of its direction were also thrown down but how far it extended or what damages the farmers may have sustained we have not yet learned let it however not be forgotten that dreadful as the scene was through the good providence of god not a single life was lost or any personal injury worth mentioning received and the buildings it is hoped will soon be restored to as good a state as they were in before boston july the building of an indiaman goes on with rapidity and it is said will be launched about the th of october and is pronounced by judges to be an excellent piece of workshmanship philadelphia aug we are happy in informing our readers that in the memory of the oldest man among us a more plentiful year has not been known than the present neither mildew nor fly has affected the wheat the grain is heavy and full and in large quantities the other grains are likewise plentiful and of an excellent quality such distinguished favours call for the gratitude of the inhabitants of the united sates to the great author of nature especially when these blessings of nature are connected in the same year with deliverance from anarchy and with the establishment of a wise free and just government albany aug by a gentleman who arrived in this city on friday last from the county of ontario in the genesee county the territory lately ceded by this state to the commonwealth of massachusetts we are informed that four days before he left that county colonel brant from niagara at the head of between and of the principal sachems and other indians of the six nations had arrived at conadoque the seat of oliver phelps esq on a visit of friendship and at the same time to receive the money due them for the lands sold to the company of messrs gorham and phelps—that they were met by mr phelps and the principal inhabitants of conadoque four miles from that place and conducted into town —that they were highly gratified with the treatment they received and with the manner in which they had disposed of their lands—the gentleman further informs that there is now about inhabitants in the above county and that the land is of a good quality new york aug the weather last week in this city and suburbs continued to be extremely hot until sunday midnight after a thunder squall the change which then took place was very sudden and unhealthy upwards of twenty persons fell unhappy []ic tions to the heat last week and it is said that as many of them died by over labouring as by drinking cold water raw rum has been found exceedingly pernicious in this extreme heat —man who was seen intoxicated but a few momments before suddenly fell on one of those days —and the cry was— poor fellow he has certainly drank too much cold water cold water has however been instantaneously fatal in se veral instances [ to be concluded in our next] we have been favoured by a friend with the following extract of a letter from grenada by the last west india packet a mr c— has just arrive here from martinico where he left the white inhabitants in arms the negroes there had conceived an idea that the parliament of england had set the english negroes free where upon those on several of the most considerable estates assembled together to the amount of and retired to the mountains declaring they would no longer be slaves saying that they had as good a right to be free as the negroes in the english islands what has been the event is unknown but some reports say that they had arms and had resisted the military and the militia and that had been taken and condemned to die it is a little singular that such an alarming spirit of discontent should first make its appearance among the french negroes if they are as has been assented by several writers so much more civilized so much better treated than those of the english islands god knows what bloodshed may soon follow from the mistaken humanity of some well meaning but ill informed leaders among you trade is reviving in america to a very great degree —and such is the appearance of things that in a very few years we may expect to see as firm an union of mercantile interests betwixt this country and the united states as ever subsisted it is in vain to instil prejudices against great britain in the mind of an american merchant he knows this to be the readymoney market and he will come to it accordingly extract of a letter from a gentleman in danville kentucky to his friend in baltimore it is with great concern i communicate to you the following truly melancholy intelligence —about three weeks ago mr richard chenoweth had six or eight men allowed him by the officer of the garrison at the falls to guard his exposed plantation in bear crab settlement below the falls in the evening of their arrival before they had taken their station as a guard a number of indians rushed into mr chenoweth's house killed two of the soldiers and three of mr chenoweth's children and tomahawked and scalped his wife leaving her on the floor for dead—mr chenoweth who had his arm broke by the savages with the rest of the men made their escape—there was one of mr chenoweth's children sick in a chamber and it is reported she never heard any thing of the dreadful massacre but next morning crawling down stairs she was inexpressibly shocked at the sight of a beloved parent almost breathless—mr chenoweth returned next day to his house and carried his wife to a neighbouring plantation where they are both likely to recover and what is remarkable she wants to return to her own house—the savages have been very troublesome in this neighbourhood —a small company are gone to white river to extirpate or indians who as spies have informed have upwards of horses &c at that place extract of a letter from a gentleman in pittsburgh to his friend in philadelphia dated sept the indians have killed six soldiers at the mouth of little sandy creek below the great kanawa where the new englanders were forming a settlement what mighty contests rise from trivial things that the present revolution in france is a consequence of the revolution in america cannot admit of a doubt the american revolution originated in adams a very insignificant bostonian not that this adams had the least expectation of american independence when he fomented the opposition to the stampact indeed no human wisdom could possibly have foreseen the subsequent folly and imprudence of the british administration and its obsequious parliament an administration so totally destitute of common sense so totally ignorant of every princple of sound policy no nation ever beheld adams had the sagacity to avail himself of such despicable policies—fortunately for the american cause the generals that were sent from england were of congenial abilities with the minister and the americans themselves were surprised at the facility with which they acquired their independence —yet all the blunders of the british administration and the miserable conduct of the british generals would hardly have been sufficient to emancipate america notwithstanding her extreme weakeness without the assistance of france and this assistance depended entirely on dr franklin being driven to paris by the fatalphilippic of a certain great lawyer such therefore is the chain of concurrent circumstances that hath overturned the french monarch if the british minister had possessed common sagacity—if he could have distinguished a general from a corporal if franklin had been treated with common civility america would have remained a british colony and france an absolute monarch for ages yet to come mr ephraim daniel of baker'srow mileend received the following letter from a friend in holland last week sir your friend l—y who is just come here from the east indies desires me to inform you that your unfortunate relation who left you with the transports for botany bay was well in february last he has settled at port jackson and has leave to teach the children of some of your nation to read and write in your own way the place is much improved since you ahve had any letters form it as there was no person without a habitation and being in some order when he left it except wearing apparel very little is wanting but business but you may thank the dutch at batavia for it as they have brought several useful things there the last crops of corn and the garden grounds were in very good condition and what makes the settlement more convenient one of the people who came in the first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for use and ornament as the clay is equally good as that of delft or elsewhere he was surprised to see so many people without hats or shoes and houses without windows and full of wicker and rush furniture which is used in the place of almost every thing else if the smiths had a plentiful supply of coal and iron hardly any utensils would be wanting your nephew has two children and says all that are born there are very healthy and more born than are buried or executed of grown people the christians church was quite finished before he came away and he thinks if there were enough of your people they might have a place to themselves the farthest of the lines was seldom visited by the savages and it was reported when he came away that as soon as more troops and a new governor comes over they would go farther than ever up the country when some valuable discovers are expected to be made they have a gum which may be used for gum arabic which is veyr useful he expects several of your people will go from batavia to settle there very soon and wonders a way for sending old clothes is not yet found out norfolk island is os thinly inhabited that it is not worth a stranger's while to land there and as little is said about it there as if it was as far off as europe &c &c extract of a letter from a gentleman in america to his friend in greenock no doubt sir you have been expecting this some time a remittance in money for your goods but as part of them is still on hand i could not properly answer you in cash or bills however if you will accept of wheat in return it shall be immediately sent you for our wheat crop has been so plentiful that we can supply you with many thousand bolls of an eceeding fine quality and to my knowledge there are several ships loading for your market at present the american congress having declared it to be the interest of the united states to encourage agriculture by the cultivation of large plantations and to purchase their merchandize from europe have in consequence considerably lowered the duties on such merchandize they have also resolved to sell four or five millions of acres of land instead of two millions which they sold annually in the states the produce of which will son suffice to prevent the necessity of circulating paper money any longer the merchants trading to north america prior to the year are desired to meet in the merchants hall on friday the th december at o'clock noon on business of importance glasgow dec orders are sent to plymouth for the echo sloop of war capt drew lately arrived from newfoundland and now lying in the sound to get ready for sea and proceed with all possible dispatch to new york—to acquaint the american merchants that the british ports are open for the importation of american wheat —it is to be hoped this salutary measure will reduce the present high price of wheat and flour the west india merchants who were in the utmost anxiety for the arrival of the packet from the west indies have been most agreebly relieed from their apprehensions the account of the insurrections in martinique which we received through france and which has been since confirmed in the national assembly naturally alarmed them for the british islands we are happy to inform our readers that the packet brings no intelligence whatever of tumult of insurrections we have not heard even that the letters bring any account of the conspiracy in martinique a circumstance which can only be accounted for by the little communication which exists between the islands at this season of the year this day arrived a mail from newyork brought to falmouth by the sandwich packet in thirtythree days extract of a letter from dominica sept this day week the most diabolical design that that ever was formed was discovered in martinico it was an insurrection of the negroes who were that night to have set fire to the large and beautiful town of st pierre while the white people were all in confusion and striving to escape the flames they were to be butchered indiscriminately man woman and child—the combustibles were laid in upwards of houses consisting of hemp dipped in turpentine the plot was not discovered till five o'clock in the evening when a negro belonging to an old lady stung with remorse on thinking that he must murder the woman who brought him up form a child disclosed it to her the troops being thereupon assembled of the negroes were taken armed with a hanger and a long knife the insturments which were in a few hours to have put a period to the existence of upwards of people all the inhabitants have been under arms ever since as they are afraid the negroes will attemp to release the who are in gaol living out of the world to the printer sir about two month ago i went to the country to pay a visit to a friend in a remote county and though i am much of what may be called a newspaper man i never thought of ordering my papers to be sent down to me to my utter astonishment my rustic landlord did not take in own newspaper so there was i stuck down with my friend in the country—knowing no more of what passed in town than if i had been in lapland intending every day should be my last i went on without ordering your or any other paper till two months had passed away at which period i returned to town and there sir i was quite a new man and just as if i had dropped down from the clouds every day i heard people talking of occurrences of which i knew nothing revolutions in france by fishwomen and battles in flanders against the emperor who i thought was fighting against the turks but even this was not the most distressing—for one day meeting a friend i inquired very cordially after his wife who i found a few days afterwards had eloped just before with another gentleman and meeting with a lady i inquired kindly for her sister who i found had departed to the other world a fortnight before on this account i never will stir again out of the world unless your paper goes along with me i hold a newspaper to be a kind of viaticum with which every man should be provided and which become the more necessary the further we remove from town it is the only way to keep pace with what is going on every day in the fashionable or literary world—and to prevent talking about dead friends or wives that have absconded in short sir a newspaper is my creed—and never will i again travel without my faith along with me having fully experienced the unpleasantness of being sent back into the world as ignorant as if i had been born again—i hereby give notice—that if an hottentot friend of mine invites me who does not take in your paper or some other—i will not visit him dick desperate account of a singular sect called shaking quakers in america i n the united states of america there are some jews and various denomications of christians —as roman catholics lutherans presbyterians congregationalists baptists quakers dunkers moravians deists methodists newlights sandimanians universalists and shaking quakers all of whom are allowed to perform religious worship accoridng to the dictates of their consciences the shaking quakers are a new sects that sprang up about the year an old woman called the elect lady with twelve disciples all of which were said to be europeans were the

speak in unknown languages this lady risided in the northwesterly part of the state of new york where she began to instil her tenets into some of the people there—afterwards she rambled from place to place promulgating her religion and gaining proselytes in new england and elsewhere—she engrossed the kingdom of heaven to herself and followers to the seculsion of all others she pretended her mission was immediately from heaven—that she travelled in pain for her elect —could speak in seventrytwo unknown languages in which she conversed with those that had departed this life—that there had not been a true church upon earth since the days of the apostles until her's was erected—that both the living and the dead must be saved in by and through her —must confess their sins unto her and procure her parson or they could not be saved—that that she gathered her church from both earth and hell as every person that had died since the time of the apostles until her church was set up was damned and that they were ocntinually making intercession to her for salvation which was the occasion of her talking to them in those unknown tongues those that entered into her church were obliged to confess their sins and deliver up their jewels rings necklaces buckles watches &c to be disposed of as she thought fit it has been reported that some of these confessions proved very beneficial for some of her church members owned they had stolen things that had been laid to innocent persons when these people carry on their worship they pretend to praise the lord by singing dancing jumping turning round falling down tumbling &c and in the mean time some will be trembling groaning sighing and sobbing whilst others are preaching praying exhorting &c others will be clapping their hands shouting hallowing screaming and making such a hideous noise that it may be heard at a great distance and will often affrighten the spectators they often dance three hours without intermission and when any of them are tired of praising the lord that way they are whipped by others to make the worship go on briskly they dance till they are much emaciated the young women grow pale appear like ghosts or apparitions or like deserters from a churchyard —if i may use the sailor's phrase they make no use of the eucharist or of water baptism in their churchs are averse to wars fighting and swearing they use the plain language and cry—yea and nay instead of yes and no but the other quakers do not approve of all their tenets at particular times they labour very hard at their respective occupations and are very careful that no time is spent in idleness they pretend they hold a correspondence with the saints and angels and that they frequently see and converse with the spirits of their departed friends many of them refuse to be with their wives because they suppose they are part of the hundred and forty and four thousand mentioned in the revelations that were redeemed from the earth and were not defiled with women they hold that they have already been made partakers of the first resurrection and that on them the second death will have no power they do not allows the instrumental music in their churches because they suppose it was ceremonial and is abolished—but pretend that they carry on their worship by the immediate power and influence of the holy ghost and that they have scripture warrents for their practice a[]—sing unto god—praise the lord in the dance —o clap your hands all ye people—shout on to god—make a joyful noise—fall down before the lords&c

bring over a part of the military to his side against the people he began with subalterns several of whom took a certain oath of attachment which he administered to them but when he came to the major that officer declined saying he had already engaged himself on the side of the people incensed at this reply he reviled him in very opprobrious terms and at last laid his cane upon him frustrated in his attempts upon the infantry he made his next application to the regiment of artillery but with as little success they informed him that themselves and culverins were stationed there for the protection of the people and for them only should be used driven to the last shift his distress suggested the sorry expedient of having recourse to the people of colour who here form a considerable corps by a small dose of flattery these people so readily to be caught by a little seeming attention promised to stand by him and did so as long as they usually stand firm to any thing—that is till their fears for their own persons became an object of more weighty concern—they then abandoned him the humiliating familiarities to which he descended to this motley rabble were truly disgusting he embraced them called them his enfans and cher amis and practised all the dirty condescensions which those only who are conversant in the praiseworthy art of cajoling can form any conception of the effect of this conduct was as might be expected insolence—one of this banditti presumed to strike a grenadier—this incensed both the military and the peopl—the consequence was their doughty leader was

congress is still sitting at new york and from the multiplicity of business before them there is no likelihood of the session's soon closing we are curious to know what foreigners will say of our new

committee appointed to give in an estimate state at upwards of eight millions of dollars accustomed to disappointment in hopes of improvement in politics and commerce we feel a reluctance to entertaining very sanguine wishes yet appearances encourage the expecttion of the f—deral government's acting with the energy and effect that will give it respectability the prejudices and animosities created by the late contest are gradually dying away and to the idleness and dissipation flowing from the same source industry has in a great degree succeeded a progress has also been made in manufactures of various kinds that was not expected and the persevering in them affords a strong presumption of those concerned deriving advantage throughout the union the public opinion on matters of government has of late experienced rapid changes vice president adams in his highly esteemed work has fully demonstrated the absurdity of democracy and the superior excellence of a mix form such as that of britain his deductions from premises admitted as just have abated much of the popular aversion to monarchy and as every thing matures quickly in our transatlantic soil it would not surprise many were united america to have a sovereign earin the next century in no one instance has our new admnistration given general satisfaction more than in their conduct towards the indians the interests of those unfortunate people will be studiously attended to and they will be effectually protected against the lawless violence of the individuals or states who wished to wrest their lands from them this determination is dictated by policy as well humanity for it is now become the interest of the states to check by every means short of violence the erratic disposition of their citizens who when removed to the wilds beyond the mountains cannot be regarded as of any value in a political view governor philips describes port jackson which is only about nine miles to the northward of botany bay

settling a commercial arrangement between great britain and ireland the other for giving a constitution to canada in feeling the former the minister will have to contend with strong commercial prejudices in the latter he will have to encounter religious principles the british settlers in canada are comparatively few in number the great bulk of the canadians are the descendants of french and are roman catholics the former are protestants fleaury in france and walpole in england were not fonder of peace than mr pitt conquests may be made by war but consequence and wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system if the first commercial nation in the world besides these considerations the grand secret has been discovered since the present minister came into power that the best riddance england ever had was of her american colonies because by this means she becomes thoroughly collected at home to oppose every foreign power without the expence and blood of supporting the americans at the same time that they cannot do without british manufactures in one line or another thus they are under the necessity of protecting themselves at the same time that like the rest of europe they are obliged to resort to our superior mercantile market application has been lately made to the lords of the treasury for an order on the bank to issue some of the new silver coin in aid

without the smallest reserve the following philosophical facts lead us to presume that the winter now setting in will prove a mild one it has been constantly remarked that when this season commences early and with severity in newfoundland and the more northern part of north america it becomes extremely rigorous and of a proportionate continuance there when in the above climate the winters have been severe they have invariably been mild with us and vice versa now the ships which sailed from newfoundland the beginning of october last saw the hills already covered with snow there is still

portsmouth nov the convicts already arrived at this port from newfoundland are near fourscore in number a few others are expected these unhappy wretches are almost destitute of every sort of covering and some of them are labouring under sickness and infirmity their story is accurateas follows about the middle of last june this miserable class of beings to the amount of men and boys and twelve women all of whom were convicts were embarked at dublin on board the duke of leinster transport the owners of which who are dublin merchants contracted with the government of ireland for carrying the convicts to the north american states after the ship had been at sea five weeks part of which was foul weather the provision is said to have fallen short the master of the transport capt harrison accordingly stood in for newfoundland and layto till night when he disembarked at bull's bay and a little distance from it with as much secrecy as possible his desperate freight to prevent this proceeding being too early early known he landed with them provision for the immediate supply of their wants and bore away with a press of sail the hungry victims lived for three days in a state of warfare quarrelling about their food the strongest beat the weak and over a cask of rank butter or beef there was for a time as severe fighting as if a kingdom had been at stake they reached the town of st john's on the th of july and exhibited the most appaling procession ever seen in that country the inhabitants had immediate councils and the military and navy cooperating a place of security was fixed upon at a distance from the town and they were lodged here under a guard here the irish howl was nightly sung in full chorus and the centinels were frequently frighted with the noise while on their posts a battle or two every half hour kept them festive all day and when the provision supplied to them by the inhabitants was lessening they broke away and laid hold of every thing that was eatable without enquiring whether it had an owner some of these poor wretches were anxious to be received into the service of the inhabitants and probably might have reformed if so fostered but all of them have a claim to the charity of this country for that supply of raiment which is necessary to guard them against the inclement weather in consequence of the order of the privy council the

the president of the united states the inhabitants of this metropolis have now the happiness to felicitate themselves on having among them the virtuous general who delivered their capital from the oppression of a british foe and in the same person the magnanimous president of the united states of america—the president left newyork on thursday the th instant to visit the eastern states attended ouly by his two private secretaries and servants—actuated by the principles of a true republican patriot and considing in the ardent affections of the citizens in the states through which he had to pass he had it in vic travel without the temporary parade which his dignified station might justly clam but wherever he came his merits were already known and the people with heartfelt joy and high approbation of his virtues saluted him the defender of their freedom and independence —the worthy governor of this commonwealth haivng an exalted estimation of the virtuous president and although much indisposed as to his health was determined to shew the president the honours of the government in a stile suitable to his dignity accordingly he ordered the troops of middlesex horse to escort him through that county and permitted general brooks to exhibit to the president on cambridge common as he passed a fine body of the militia of the d division consisting of about men all in complete uniform and equipment the president was honoured with a salute as he passed them the governor requested the lieutenant governor and the council to meet the president at cambridge and would have accompanied them himself hand his health permitted whither they were escorted by col tyler's corps of the horse the lieutenant governor and council met him there and preceded the president under the

william smith and rachel wall pursuant to their sentence for highway robbery october we are informed by very respectable authority that mr m'gillvry has written to the president of the united states a full and sensible account of the rise and progress of the disputes subsisting between the georgians from which statement he expected to prove to a demonstration that he has not acted the inconsistent part which some have alleged neither has there been such cruelties committed by the indians from mr m'gillevry's abilities and considering he was educated in europe being the son of a scotchman and indian women we have no reason to expect any savage cruelties from an of his people but on the contrary it is rather to be presumed that his proposals which are contained in his letter to the president are of a rational nature and many probably bring about a final and an advantageous treaty with the united states november on thursday last the viscount de ponteves gave a surperb entertainment and ball to a number of respectable ladies of gentleman of this town on board l'illustre of seventyfour guns the boats of the fleet the state yacht and barge received the company at foster's wharf before o'clock—and on the appearance of the first boat having ladies on board a signal gun was fired from l'illustre and in an instant the squadron was beautifully arrayed with the flags of all nations on arriving at the ship the company were very politely received by the viscount and conducted to the state room—the marines saluting as the company passed them at one o'clock the whole sat down to a table liberally spread with a profusion of luxuries and delicacies in a hall erected for the occasion which was very fancifully decorated at the head of the table was a castle of pastry having thirteen metal guns by which from tubes that communicated through the table and the company were saluted with a f—deral discharge on the top of the castle waved a small white ensign—the device two hearts—the motto the united hearts of america and france the head of the hall was ornamented with a heart pieced with arrows—and in the motton homage to the fair daughters of america a fine compliment made by the noble viscount to his female guests after dinner the ball began and closed before nine o'clock and on departure his excellency was saluted with thirteen rockets let off from a boat moored at some distance from the ship rhode island and north carolina yet remain averse to the new government they refuse allegiance to all acts of the states and of course do not participate in any privilee they are treated in respect to port entries &c as foreign states no fewer than nine young ladies are going to the market of love in india on board the william pitt what a disgrace to our young men at home by the last letters from india we understand they were going on in the plodding way with nothing new or important—the markets are overstocked with british goods so as to enable our countrymen to supply themselves with most articles at a cheaper rate than if they were at home the credit of the revenue rather upon the increase lord cornwallis is as strict as ever who is expected to remain another year among them to the no small regret of those who left england for the sake of oriental wealth our female adventurers have also found it a bad market british beauty never fails of finding its admirers but the late restriction in the east have rendered wives forbidden fruit of which neither civil nor military dare to think of tasting character of the female sex by mr ledyard a celebrated traveller i have always remarked that women in all countries are civil obliging tender and humane that they are ever inclined to be gay and cheerful timorous and modest and that they do not hesitate like men to perform a generous action not haughty not arrogant not supercilious they are full of courtesy and fond of society more liable in general to err than man but in general also more virtuous and performing more good actions than he to a woman whether civilized or savage i never addressed myself in the language of decency and friendship without receiving a decent and friendly answer with men it has been otherwise in wandering over the barren plains of inhos pitable denmark through honest sweden and fro zen lapland rude and churlish finland unprin cipled russia and the widespread regions of the wandering tartar if hungry dry cold wet or sick the women have ever been friendly to me and uniformly so and to add to this virtue so worthy the appellation of benevolence these actions have been performed in so free and so kind a manner that if i was dry i drank the sweetest draught and if hungry i eat the coarse morsel with a double relish we have this day received quebec newspapers down to the th may from which the following is extracted— quebec may we hear late accounts from niagara mention that the indians in that quarter are much alarmed in consequence of a message said to be received by them from the states that they had now raised an army to take their own for niagara and that two thousand men of that army were now on their way from new york—desiring the indians to lye still and look on and that they would punish those that should interfere it was also said that the people of new york were determined of themselves to lay open the post of oswego and that emissaries had been employed to persuade the indians they would be greatly benefited by that event we are rather inclined to believe the indians are too sensible of the great benefits already conferred upon them by our neighbours in buying their lands from them to think of accepting any more from that quarter and we would recommend it to the newborn sovereignty on this side the atlantic before they testify their impatience that national treaties like private agreements are not to be infringed by one and performed by the other party—pay and you shall receive [as to the americans making an attempt upon niagara they have long had it in contemplation to get possession of our posts upon the lakes in canada] may the concerned in the ship columbia and sloop washington have received letters from the captain kendrick dated at nootka in july last he informs them that he passed the winter preceding on the northwest coast of america that he was then bound on a voyage further northward and from thence intended to proceed to canton—the letters were forwarded to mexico by a spanish fleet that had been at nootka and from thence to the spanish charge des affaires at new york they were covered to the president of the united states of america [from what appeared in our paper of friday last see glasgow intelligence p and what is mentioned above it seems very probable that the affair of nootka sound had been a preconcerted scheme between the americans and spaniards as capt kendrick addresses his dispatches for the president of the states without making the least mention from what is made public of any british ships being then at nootka sound] by recent letters from america we learn that the congress of the nited states after warm debates in both houses particularly in that of the representatives passed an act for the purpose of fixing permanently their seat of government at german town in pennsylvania the two new provinces in north america kentucky and vermont whose population already is so very considerable were formed by the vast numbers of inhabitants who fled from the destruction and ravages of the unhappy contest between great britain and her colonies and though the greatest part of them were then deemed loyalists yet they have now jooined the american confederation seated on the banks of the great river mississippi far to the westward of all the other states they can either navigate northerly to the lakes or southerly to the spanish settlements on the coasts of the gulf of mexico and carry on a lucrative trade with the indians they are possessed of as fertile a tract of country as any in the world the position of which they also sd by navigable rivers to maryland virginia and pennsylvania and from thence as their viewstend to every country in europe thus from the most distressed situation to rise to opulence and independence ina few years must excite admiration agriculture at present seems to be the peculiar province of american industry from whence wealth will flow into every part of that vast country as it abounds in large tracts of rich land level grounds with a deep soil and extended savannahs while to the northward the fisheries and shipbuilding amply compensate for the want of an equal fertility and though not so abundant in coin yet the provinces produce the finest meadows form whence a provision trade will be

indeed novel purpose of knowing whether as the teststor had originally devised the several sums for the use of british subjects and the americans having ceased to be in that situations since their independence the annuity ought not to revert to this kingdom or to some other of his majesty's colonies to be applied to similar purposes this being the first determination of that nature since the american revolution the lord chancellor decided it with that superior dignity of sentiment that always attends his decrees two phrases are sufficient—all charitable devices are to be held sacred—we cannot rake up the ashes of the dead in search of latent intentions the annuities and arrears must be paid and messrs anderson and gipps and likewise the city of london must be paid their costs curious advertisement from the pittsburgh gazette pittsburgh dec july the twentyseventh day my wife betsey ran away from bed and board—and this did say she would no longer with me stay since she has

curiosity and amazement they were asked whether they would not attend the evening service which they readily complied and seemed particularly delighted with the organ the cherokee chiefs having made us an offer of men gratitude obliges us to make them some acknowledgement whether we accept their offer or not—we can very well spare them the members of the halter club—all our housebreakers highwaymen pick pockets swindlers faro and e o table keepers—and all their accomplices to an amazing number such a collection would be a truly valuable present—among them are found dispersedly all the qualities of able generals—skilful financiers —able negotiators active citizens—and men highly expert at a coup de main were we to add the pugilistic tribe—the cherokee chiefs might on their return to their own country enter into a boxing war against their enemies—with a certainty of the most brilliant success trading justices and lawyers they would perhaps be glad to have and it is the opinion of most people that a few thousands of the latter description of men might be spared by letters from the new york packet dated october from philadelphia we learn that there has been a very fine harvest in the southern states and that the wheat has been wonderfully productive a very large quantity had been bought up for the spanish markets the quality of european goods imported the last season was immense goods selling for considerable loss and such will always be the case when the merchants in england anticipate a ray of fruitfulness of the american soil—the appearance of a spanish war had given them great prospects of commercial advantages and a seven years war is what the americans were all earnestly wishing for when the cherokee chiefs first visited coventgarden theatre one of them appeared much delighted with the splendid appearance of an indian cap worn by one of the pantomime actors this being observed the performer was directed the performance the chief amazed at the offer of the magnificent present said through his interpreter that even in his won country he should be unable to repay it however at present he would do the utmost in his power on this he ordered the actor to approach him and then lighting his cherokee pipe stuffed with a variety of nauseous combustibles he too three whiffs himself and presenting the tube desired the actor to take three whiffs also—the greatest favour a cherokee could confer the actor aastonished at the singularity of this unexpected honour reluctantly complied with the requestto the great entertainment of the dramatic circle dominicast pierre martinico sept this colony is in a perfect state of anarchy is so much that we have had thoughts of quitting the island and going to trinidad taking the negroes with us unless some speedy and effectual succours arrive the colony is utterly ruined the greater part of the colonists this day assembled at grosmorne—the grenadiers who were in the fort of trinity with twenty three officers of the regiment were glad to make their escape—there are men in the fort bourbon many of whom are from dominica guadaloupe and other colonies an supposed to have been sent by martinico refugees—the firing of cannon is heard incessantly at this rate the magazine of powder will soon be consumed the municipality of fort royal have been obliged to promise and sign whatever the insurgents have been please to dictate—the soldiers run about the streets and oblige the inhabitants to give them money—imagine in short a scene of confusion and terror and you will then have some idea of the persent [] of fort bourbon and fort royal the town of st pierre swarms with strangers who come here from all parts m chabrol colonel of the regiment which has been sent here together with

mulattoes extract of a letter from dublin nov the drafts at cork yesterday received the agreeable orders to return to their respective regiments immediately the officers appointed to raise independent companies in ireland have received orders to repair forthwith to england with whatever complement of men already entered but not to proceed with the completion of their number in conference to this order they are preparing for their immediate departure last tuesday two eminent merchants of this city received orders by way of a vessel arrived at cork from mess de fouseca olivarez and co at seville for the immediate exportation of cotton white linen and mixed goods to a very large amount monday evening the elizabeth and mary mark purcell master arrived at waterford from annapolis in maryland after a long and dangerous passage of days in which they had nearly exhausted the whole of their provisions having been a very short allowance of half a naggin of rum diluted with one pint of bad water for twentyfour hours she is heavy laden having on board six hundread hogsheads of tobacco a large quantity of pipe staves barrel hoops &c and has been expected more than two months eight per cent was offered as insurance on ship and cargo but refused on account of the then probability of a war the indian ships lately returned from madras and bengal gives unfavourable accounts of all the branches of commerce except that of matrimony which has succeeded wonderfully in the last female exportations out of eleven ladies who embarked on a marriage venture on board the chesterfield captain burgess nine were connubially linked to weakly husbands within three months after their arrival and the other two were left in a way to complete this fortunate band of hymeneal adventu rers the indians it is our wish in imitation of other newswritters to give now and then an account of such new publications as deserve the attention of the public but in a paper published only twice a week where so much naturally occurs under the article of temporary news it is but seldom we can find room for this purpose—when however any ting remarkable appears in the literary world we never fail to notice it although it may not be in our power to give an extensive and critical account of its excellencies we take up the pen with real pleasure at present to announce the publication of a tragedy intitled the indians the reputed offspring of a learned professor in this university the great applause with which this play was received when performed at richmond theatre has raised the expectations of those who were not present at the performance to the highest pitch and we think we may take upon ourselves to assert that upon perusing it even their highest expetations will not be disappointed—the plot of the piece is taken from a well known story published at the end of a volum of poems written by the same gentleman in the choice of a plot where so many dramatic writers of respectable talents have erred our author is peculiarly happy he ha strictly observed the advice of horace denique sit quid vis simplex dumtaxat et unum it is simple and yet it does not disgust by an appearance of nakedness—it is one for the complaints of maraino and the return of oniyo form a beginning the machinations of yerdal and neidan to prevent their meeting a middle and defeat of those arts an end which combined wake up a compleat and connected whole in the delineation of character the author has on alevery occasion attended to the quid quemque decent —there are hoever some few parts which the critic halts to consider but which amidst so many beauties he blushes to censure—some lines for instance in the character of ononthio do not strike us at first as strictly natural is so much humanity found inthe breast of an inan sachem as to prompt him to spare a victim about to be destroyed accoridng to the custom of the country that victim a captive of war and not only so but a briton who has been fighting against his countrymen amongst whom was his only son whom he bleived slain would he exert himself so much in favour of a stranger and a foe at the risk of displeasing the village and consequently of losing his power or is it likely that he would have greater influence with the superstitious crowd than he who was deemed of skill to bend to his purpose the demons that sway the fortune of mankind—another question concenring ononthio and we leave him is it consistent with the philosophic firmness of the sachem so to despair on receiving news of his son's death as to declare that he should know no comfort but to die or is it consistent with his humanity to leave maraino at such a period of distress when she most stood in need of his kind offices—the first and best supported character in the piece is that of maraino her mind seems intended as the seat of every amiable virtue her grateful reverence of ononthio her unaffected piety and her humanity in interfering to save an unknown captive from death are pleasing which givean insight into her nature in the breast of mariano every thing is subordinate to her love for onaiyo this leading feature in her caracter is properly kept in view during the course of the piece but even in this masterpiece the author has perhaps once deviated a little from nature the sentiments maraino utters during the conversation with sydney in the fifth act are rather those of a phiosopher and divine than a young creature the chorus of whole heart are tuned to the sweetest strains of tenderness and love can she who had lately discovered a long lost brother talk so coldly in his presence can she who had so lately heard of the safety of an adoredhusband so entirely banish his image from her mind as to converse on matters so indifferent can the gentle maraino become the cold moralist—with this one exception the part of which we are speaking is finely drawn and highly interesting—the language of the piece is every where elegant and in many places where the sentiment requires it sublime the author has frequently dignified his verse by the introduction of obsolete words this in general produces a good effect—but there is a danger of using them too often and of chusing them too ancient it is a dangerous and difficult talk where all is so excellent to refer to any particular passage of scene as deserving most notice it requires no small degree of taste and judgement if there is any preference to be given it is perhaps to that scene in the d act where onaiyo gives an account of the battle at quebec and the scene in the th act where maraino is prompted by neidan to slay her brother—who proves his innocence by the production of her husband's belt the sight of which draws an elegant speech from the enraptured fair this scene however would be improved did it conclude with something more apt to the joyful moment than the solemn sounds of ononthio a speech excellent in itself and containing a very fine sentiment sed nunc non erat his locus— upon the whole the tragedy upon which we have guided by impartiality spoken so freely is in our opinion far superior to most of those plays which have appeared of late years—it is devoid of bombast—it is nature—and she must inevitably please advice from charlestown south carolina says that the indians in washington county commit the most horrid depredations and cruelties they have set fire to several houses and a woman who had a sick husband telling them from a window of her calamity they shot her dead on the spot and then set fire to the spot the sick man was consequently burnt a colonel harling has greatly exerted and distinguished himself in opposing the indians on a part of the american frontiers this gentleman with two hundred men even went into the very heart of an indian settlement and defeated the savages he then penetrated the country destroying all before him and returned without the loss of a man every possible acknowledgement was made of his services and bravery and a liberal subscription made for his gallant little army quebec december yesterday's post from montreal conveyed letters to several gentlemen in town all corroboratiing the following extract sir i have to inform you by several letters received here on saturday from detroit we are informed the americans under general sinclair had been twice defeated about the th ult with the loss of from to men by the indians the indians first attacked a body of horse which they had drawn into a snare and cut the whole of them off in a second engagement they were likewise victorious having nearly killed as many on account of which sinclair thought proper to retreat and the last accounts state the indians having divided themselves into small parties had so harrassed him that he was obliged to leave the wounded in the field—sinclair lost his artillery a cohorn and grasshopper it is said the indians are very much elated at their success and that numbers were daily joining them at their head quarters about the maimis towns—one indian it is said killed with his own hand the indians were extremely civil to the traders from detriot having assisted them when they knew of the approach of the americans to remove their property to safety except ammunition and arms these are facts so well ascertained that there does not remain the least doubt of them they may be attended with very serious and important consequences to the province as i dare say all will be imputed to the british for supplying these indians with arms and ammunition—in short i would not be surprized to hear of an american army raising to attack this country * the loss is here specified but other letters differing in number we shall only say the estimate in general does not appear considerable longevity—at taconey a small village about seven miles from philadelphia there is now living a shoemaker of the name of robert glen who in december last attained the great age of one hun dred and fourteen years scotland was the place of his nativity he remembers having seen king william iii and was present at the two succeeding coronations neither his memory nor his sight are in the least impaired and such is his strength that after working all the week at his profession he regularly walks on sunday to philadelphia and back his third wife is now living and is not more than thirty years old cape of good hope the following account of the inhabitants of this settlement is given by a late traveller the education of youth has hitherto been very much neglected the government never hit upon any successful plan for the establishment of public schools and the individual had no other ambition but that of qualifying his sons by writing and accounts to become servants of the company this body of merchants had a number of persons in their employ who were very ill paid their salaries indeed were sufficient to afford them a bare subsistence but it tacitly allowed them to negotiate for themselves the consequence of such a conduct was that each became a kind of petty dealer each had his little private shop in some corner of his house the most paltry articles were in the list of their commodities for sale and those who ranked high in government and assumed a string of fullfounding epithets to their names felt no sore of indignity in retailing the produce of their gardens not indeed avowedly but through the medium of their slaves in fact the minds of every class the governor the clergy the f[]l and the secretary of the court of justice excepted were wholly bent on trade knopman or merchant was a title that conferred rank at the cape to which the military even aspired on this subject the ideas of the dutch differ widely from those of the chinese who have degraded the merchant into the very lowest order of their society that portion of the day not employed in the concerns of trade is usually devoted to the gratification of the sensual appetite few have any taste for reading and none for the cultivation of the fine arts—they have no kind of public amusements except occasional balls nor is there much social intercourse but by family parties which usually consist of card playing or dancing moneymatters and merchandize engross their whole conversation yet none are opulent though many in easy circumstances there are no beggars in the whole colony and but a few who are objects of public charity the subsistence for these is derived from the interest of a fund established out of the church superfluities from alms donations and collections made after divine service and not from any tax laid upon the public except indeed a few colonial assessments for the repairs of the streets and public works the inhabitants of the cape have little drawback on their profits on the produce of their labour it has been the remark of most travellers that the ladies of the cape are pretty lively and good humoured possessing little of that phlegmatic temper which is a principal trait in the national character of the dutch the difference in the manners and appearance of the young men and the young women in the same family is inconceivably great the former are clumsy in their shape awkward in in their carriage and of an unsocial disposition whilst the latter are generally of a small delicate form below the middle size of easy and unaffected manners well dressed and fond of social intercourse an indulgence in which they are seldom restrained by their parents and which they as seldom turn to abuse they are here indeed less dependent on and less subject to the caprice of parents than else where primogeniture entitles to no advantage but all the children male and female share alike in the family property no parent can disinherit a child without assigning on proof on at least of the fourteen reasons enumerated in the justinian code by the law of the colony a community of all property both real and personal is supposed to take place on the marriage of two person unless the contrary should be particularly provided against by solemn contract made before marriage where no such contract exists the children on the death of either parent are entitled to that half of the joint property which was supposed to belong to the deceased and which cannot be withheld on application after they are come of age it is but justice to the young females of the cape to r emark that many of them have profited much more than could be expected from the limited means of education that the place affords in the better families most of them are taught music and some have acquired a tolerable degree of execution many understand the french language and some have made great proficiency in the english they are expert at the needle and all kinds of lace knotting and tambour work and in general make up their own dresses following the prevailing fashion of england brought from time to time by the female passengers bound to india from whom they may be said to catch the manners living as they rise neither are the other sex while boys deficient in vivacity or talent but for want of the means of a proper education to open their minds and excite in them a desire of knowledge they soon degenerate into the common routine of eating smoaking [sic] and sleeping few of the male inhabitants associate with the english except such as hold employments under the government this backwardness may be said to be owing in part to the different habits of the two nations and partly perhaps to the reluctance that a vanquished people must always feel in mixing with their conquerors one of the recent circumstances that have occupied the attention of the judicial power at botany bay was the removal of one of the free female convicts from sidney cove for keeping a house of illfame as the following speech of gen washington at the opening of the congress of the united states at new york nov gives an impartial account of the situation of tha country we are persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives it is some abatement of the satisfaction with which i meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally i am not able to add to it information that the indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our western frontier have terminated you will i am persuaded learn with no less concern than i communicate it that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest an earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier—to stop the further effusion of blood—to arrest the progress of expense—to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable purposes—in making which efforts i consulted less my own anticipations of the event or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case a detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thus far will i trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed the issue of some of them indeed is still depending but a favorable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by anything that has yet happened in the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service a sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace it will i presume be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased it must add to your concern to be informed that besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it a part of the cherokees known by the name of chickamagas inhabiting five villages on the tennessee river have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements it was hoped that the treaty of holston made with the cherokee nation in july would have prevented a repetition of such depredations but the event has not answered this hope the chickamagas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities upon the citizens of the united states in that quarter the information which has been received on this subject will be laid before you hitherto defensive precautions only have been enjoined and observed it is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever on the part of the united states or their citizens is even alleged as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter i have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures a large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete and pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed a delay of operations besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termination of the war has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts a statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable in looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be found inevitable i derive consolation from the information i receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year this however will be better ascertained in the course of the session and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostilities i can not dismiss the subject of indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the indians without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory—to enable by competent rewards the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood if in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable the prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated—this would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the united states these impediments have lessened and are lessened in local extent and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the law appears to be progressive but symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters i judged a special interposition on my part proper and advisable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders and congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend upon me shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws in fulfilling this trust i shall count entirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of the government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens i can not forbear to bring again into the view of the legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system a representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced in the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the structure of the system which in some cases tend to relax their efficacy as connected with this subject provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the courts of the united states and a supplementary definition of offenses against the constitution and laws of the union and of the punishment for such offenses will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary it would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them i particularly recommend to your consideration of the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations and other infractions of the law of nations which furnishes just subject of complaint might endanger our peace with them and in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose which takes place if not renewed at the close of the present session in execution of the authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our mint others have been employed at home provision has been made of the requisite buildings and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment there has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them the regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage as being essential to their due operation and to order in our money concerns will i doubt not be resumed and completed it is represented that some provisions in the law which establishes the postoffice operate in experiment against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country—should this upon due enquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and infor mation will i doubt not lead to the application of a remedy the adoption of a constitution for the state of kentucky has been notified to me the legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order it is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for three millions of florins—one at antwerp at the annual interest of four and onehalf per cent with an allowance of four per cent in lieu of all charges—the rates of these loans and the circumstances under which they have been made are confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced gentlemen of the house of representatives i entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effectual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the government —no measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made of the bank of the united states pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated in fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and i doubt not will engage your early attention gentlemen of the senate and of the house of representatives i content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you various temporary laws will expire during the present session among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the indian tribes will merit particular notice the results of your common deliberations hitherto will i trust be productive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment upon which under divine providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivation of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils petersburgh may there now resides in the neighbourhood of prince edward courthouse a

georgia who informs that six of the creek towns with a number of cherokees had declared war against the united states and were actually marching under the command of bowles and gilpin at attack the frontiers a great number of white people and white families have been killed and scalped by the indians in the back settlements of america among the killed and scalped is mr pugh son of colonel pugh the indians are determined on war with the americans they are headed by gilpin the successor of m'gillivray and have already commenced hostilities on the back settlements of carolina knoxville may i t is shocking to describe the bloody scenes that have lately taken place in this district the indians have killed and scalped a great number of persons among whom is colonel isaac bledose who was massacred within yards of his own house on the th instant a body of indians attacked greenfield station they killed john jervis and a negro fellow belonging to mrs tarker by the bravery of three young men viz william neely william wilson and william hall the station was preserved they killed two indians wounded several others and put them to flight it is to be remembered that neely and hall had each lost a father and two brothers and wilson a brother by the savages men are now in pursuit of the indians june about the th instant a company of seven men were attacked on the trace from

interludes yea all lewds and stageplays may be discountenanced pointing out their pernicious tendency in corrupting the morals of the people new south wales the following particulars respecting this flourishing colony will not be unacceptable to our readers — we are informed by lieutenant grant who is lately arrived from new south wales of the flourishing state of that colony he left port jackson in november last when the crops were very luxuriant and beginning to be cut down without having suffered that year from the floods governor king had opened a communication with otaheite for the purpose of supplying the colony with pork in which he had been singularly successful his majesty's armed ship porpoise having made one trip and the norfolk brig having sailed on the same employ previous to mr grant's leaving sydney the most friendly understanding exists between the natives of otaheite and the settlement of new south wales we are happy to hear that the latter country is longer in want of a staple commodity the article of coals of an excellent kind being found in abundance in hunter's river together with plenty of wood well qualified for the masting of shipping mr grant made his passage to the cape of good hope round cape horn in the brig anna josepha loaded with spars for masts and coals which latter sold immediately at the cape at rix dollars per ton nearly l sterling governor king had formed a small settlement at hunter's river for the purpose of working the coal which is of the same nature with that of newcastle mr grant entered this river in the lady nelson in order to obtain the survey of it he penetrated in his boats nearly seventy miles up the same accompanied by lieutenant colonel paterson without being able at that time to discover its source a wood resemblingsustichad also been found mr grant in his passage from england to port jackson in the lady nelson a vessel of only tons burthen with three sliding keels and built on captain schank's construction was the first that passed through the straits which separate van diemens land from new holland and sailed along a great extent of coast to the westward of any land before seen by those who had visited that country going into no higher latitude than fourth and observes that the fourth cape of new holland lies in fourth he found those he sailed along bold with very deep water wherever

survey of the coast from wilson's promontory to western port with the survey of that harbour which is well sheltered and capable of containing many sail of shipping there is abundance of wood easily to be got and plenty of water though the latter is rather difficult to be procured on account of the distance and from several shoals lying in the way which render it necessary to take advantage of

canadians who were members of the house of assembly twice dissolved for improper conduct and the proprietor of a french paper called la canadien have been arrested and thrown into jail upon a charge of treasonable and seditious practises the printing press types &c also taken possession of this vigorous measure of sir james craig has astonished the canadians not a little but the consequences will be no doubt beneficial to the country as it has crushed a faction which has for some years been gaining strength and acquiring dangerous influence over the minds of the inhabitants who are without education and ignorant of course in the extreme therefore easily misled by demagogues among their countrymen who seize every opportunity of stirring up all those prejudices which the people of this country naturally have against the british for having been allowed to preserve their language they are nearly as much frenchmen now as they were at the conquest quebec march —on sunday afternoon the printer of the canadien mr charles lafrancois was arrested and committed to jail under a warrant from the executive council on a charge of treasonable practises on monday evening dr blanchet and mr bedard and last evening mr t taschereau were also arrested and committed by the same authority on the same charges the commander in chief in scotland gave an elegant dinner at headquarters on the th curt to celebrate the king's birthdayday—at which several of the nobility and gentry generals and fieldofficers of the army were present among the other accidents that occurred on the king's birthday from the imprudent use of gunpowder is the death of girl in richmond street—her clothes were set fire by a squib and although immediately taken to the infirmary was so severely burnt that she died before morning a very melancholy accident happened at a place called the pease berwickshire as one of the baggage carts of the forfarshire militia was stopping there a fine boy about eight years of age belonging to serjeantmajor nicol got out of the cart and was climbing on the wheel when the horses suddengoing off threw him on the ground and the wheel passing over his body crushed him to death the unfortunate mother was upon the cart when this unhappy accident happened on thursday night a spirit shop in gibsonstreet glasgow was broken into and about five pounds in silver a seven shilling piece about eight shillings of copper a counterfeit halfguinea and a pocketbook containing some bills and papers carried some partial payments are marked on the bills the villains appear to have entered the shop by forcing up the window shutter with an iron bar and then breaking a pane of glass by which they got the iron bolts and the window opened on saturday last a porter was killed in the hold of a vessel in dundee harbour he was engaged unloading coals and the rope by which the iron pully was supported giving way the measure fell down upon him and killed him instantly a few days ago a mason of the name of stevenson was killed by the blowing up of some stones at templeton in the parish of auchterhouse the match unfortunately communicated too early to the powder and the explosion took place before he could get out of the way he has left a wife and two children to lament his loss montreal july this city has been for a few days past in a state of agitation occasioned by an event which has taken place at pointe claire and as this matter will be clothed no doubt in all the dress of misrepresentatation by our neighbouring enemies from the information they may receive of it we consider it a duty we owe to the community at large in this country to state the circumstances as they occurred in a fair open and candid manner by the late militia law young men are to be drafted from the general militia of the province for three months to be properly trained and of course a certain proportion of this number is to be furnished by each particular district some those drafted from the parish of pointe claire refused to march to lapraire for the purpose of joining the division stationed there in consequence of which major leprohon belonging to this particular battalion was sent on tuesday last with attendants to apprehend these refractory persons as deserters they apprehended four with some opposition and on their way to town with them they were followed by a considerable number of persons who rescued one prisoner and threatened that they would next day proceed to the depot at lapraire and bring away by force from thence the young men of the parish who were there on duty accordingly on wednesday a large body of these people assembled at la chine with the intention of carrying their threats into execution thomas m'cord esq one of the police magistrates about four o'clock in the afternoon left town accompanied by the light infantry of the th regiment and a detachment of the royal artillery with two fieldpieces under the command of major plenderleath and took post on a point opposite to the insurgents consisting of about persons of whom appeared to be armed and at the distance[] of about two acres mr m'cord with some other respectable citizens pointed out the impropriety of their conduct and the fate that would unfortunately await their perseverance urging them by every persuasion to disperse and return peaceably to their horses and obey the law they replied that they did not consider the militia bill as fully passed—that they were informed it had not received the royal sanction and that although it might have passed the house of assembly where it originated it had not obtained the approbation of the other branches of the legislate that the law if really enacted had not been promagated amongst them and that they were not properly made acquainted with it as such they could not pay obedience to it under this false and unfortunate impression these deluded people persisted but at the same time declared with shouts of vive le roi that if the government wanted their services at any time they were ready one and all to come forward with their lives in the defence of their country and that they would prove themselves in the hour of danger to be faithful subjects to a government to which they were firmly attached by every principle finding however that they still persisted in their determination on this particular object mr m'cord in his magisterial capacity read the riot act to them and ordered them to disperse which not being complied with a round shot was fired by the artillery but elevated above injury which was returned by the insurgents in a spirited fire with ball deserving of a better cause the troops then fired a volley with ball and grape but still too much elevated to do any harm which was also returned by another discharge from the mob upon which a few direct shots were fired at them it being nearly dark by the military which made them disperse and one man was found killed and another wounded it is feared mortally upper canada york july yesterday at an early hour his honour isaac brock esq administering the government of upper canada and majorgeneral commanding his majesty's forces therein arrived at this place from fortgeorge and accompanied by a numerous suite proceeded to the government building at four pm when he opened the present extra session of the legislature and delivered the following speech to both houses — honourable gentlemen of the legislature council and gentlemen of the house of assembly the urgency of the present crisis is the only consideration which would have induced me to call you together at a time when public as well as private duties elsewhere demand your care and attention but gentlemen when invaded by an enemy whose avowed object is the entire conquest of this province the voice of loyalty as well as of interest calls aloud to every person in the sphere in which he is placed to defend his country our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it they have evinced by the promptitude and loyalty of their conduct that they are worthy of the king whom they serve and of the constitution which they enjoy and it affords me particular satisfaction that while i address you as legislators i speak to mean who in the day of danger will be ready to assist not only with their counsels but with their arms we look gentlemen to our militia as well as to the regular forces for our protection but i should be wanting to that important trust committed to my care if i attempted to conceal what experience the great instructor of mankind especially of legislators has discovered that amendment in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient it is for you to consider what further improvements they still may require honourable gentlemen of the legislative council and gentlemen of the house of assembly from the history and experience of our mother country we learn that in times of actual invasion or internal commotion the ordinary course of criminal laws has been found in adequate to secure his majesty's government from private treachery as well as from open disaffection and that at such times its legislature has found it expedient to enact laws restraining for a limited period the liberty of individuals in many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the particulars of the charge and although the actual invasion of the province might justify me in the exercise of the full power reposed in me on such an emergency yet it will be more agreeable to me to receive the sanction of the houses a few traitors have already joined the enemy—have been suffered to come into the country with impunity—and have been harboured and concealed in the interior yet the general spirit of loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of this province is such as to authorise a just expectation that their efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing—the disaffected i am convinced are few—to protect and defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations is an object worthy of your most serious deliberations the speech concludes with a call for supplies proclamation the unprovoked declaration of war by the united states of america against the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and its dependencies has been followed by the actual invasion of this province in a remote frontier of the western districts by a detachment of the united states the officer commanding that detachment has thought proper to invite his majesty's subjects not merely to a quiet and unresisting submission but insults them with a call to seek voluntarily the protection of his government without condescending to repeat the illiberal epithets bestowed in this appeal of the american commander to the people of upper canada on the administration of his majesty every inhabitant of the province is desired to seek the confutation of such indecent slander in the review of his own particular cirumstances where is the canadian subject who can truly affirm to himself that he has been injured by the government in his person his property or his liberty where is to be found in any part of the world a growth so paid in prosperity and wealth as this colony exhibits settled not thirty years by a band of veterans exiled from their former possessions on account of their loyalty not a descendant of these brave people it to be found who under the fostering liberality of their sovereign has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment superior to what were possessed by their ancestors this unequalled prosperity would not have been attained by the utmost liberality of the government or the persevering industry of the people had not the maritime power of the mother country secured to its colonists a safe access to every market where the produce of their labour was in request the unavoidable and immediate consequence of a separation from great britain must be the loss of this inestimable advantage and what is offered to you in exchange to become a territory of the united states and share with them that exclusion from the ocean which the policy of their government enforces you are not even flattered with a participation of their boasted independence and it is but too obvious that once exchanged from the powerful protection of the united kingdom you must be reannexed to the dominion of france from which the provinces of canada were wrested by the arms of great britain at vast expence of blood and treasure from no other motive than to relieve her ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel neighbour the restitution of canada to the empire of france was the stipulated reward for the aid afforded to the revolted colonies now the united states the debt is still due and there can be no doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consideration for commercial advantages or rather for an expected relaxation in the tyranny of france over the commercial world are you prepared inhabitants of canada to become willing subjects or rather slaves to the despot who rules the nation of europe with a rod of iron if not arise in a body exert your energies cooperate cordially with the king's regular forces to repel the invader and do not give cause to your children when groaning under the oppression of a foreign master to reproach you with having too easily parted with the richest inheritance of this earth—a participation in the name character and freedom of britain [the proclamation concludes with a declaration that should the americans refused quarter in consequence of indians being found in canadian ranks that a severe and rigorous retaliation will take place] isaac brock majorgen and president headquarters fort george july quebec papers provincial parliament of lower canada legislative council—aug this day at two o'clock his excellency the governor in chief went in the usual state to the legislative council chamber and being seated on the throne the gentlemen usher of the black rod was sent to command the presence of the assembly which being come up the honourable speaker of the assembly said— may it please your excellency his majesty's faithful subjects the representatives of the province of lower canada have passed a bill intituled an act of facilitate the circulation of army bills their loyalty and the happiness of this province in being connected with and powerfully protected by the british nation are the basis of their constitution and the just grounds which gave rise to the formation of the militia and the firm determination to defend this country against the unexpected and unjust war that the united states have lately declared they are therefore under the greatest obligation to your excellency for having communicated to them your wise precautions on the means to ameliorate and insure for several years the punctual payment of the army by circulating bills the reimbursement of which is guaranteed in england to give them greater credit the bill limits the sums necessary and moreover provides for the interest the advantages accruing therefrom and even for the payment of the principal in specie in this province which has become expressly bound for the same at a fixed period to any person whatever who from the state of his private affairs would prefer such payment in full confidence that under the present and any unforeseen circumstance your excellency is invested with all necessary authority the representatives of the province and their constituents rely on the wisdom already experienced of your administration and in the name of the commons of lower canada i have the honour to present this bill to your excellency humbly requesting thereto his majesty's assent his excellency was pleased to

general bloomfield mooar and petit this force is composed of or regulars about the same number of militia and some volunteers from the southward the militia is almost all from the state of new york for the yankees still refuse to march with this force no doubt is entertained here but they will make an attack and if they mean to make it this season they must be prompt in their movements for the weather is getting cold and they are not well clothed or appointed mr — indeed states half of them to be without shoes or stockings which will never do for a winter campaign in this country to repel the threatened attack we are making every preparation in our power and the canadians seem well disposed to second the government sir george prevost has established a cordon the left of which is at chambly and extending to chateaguny the main encampment is half way between st john's and la prairie colonel murray is at st john's with a battalion and the isleaunoix is strongly fortified with a

very strong battalion lately arrived from the west indies are now marching to join the camp the citizens both here and at quebec mount guard and do garrison indeed there are in this island montreal five battalions of militia say to men pretty well disciplined and who on an alarm could march to this cordon in half a day—a new regiment of embodied militia has lately been formed by drafts from the different regiments of inrolled militia in this island and old major murray is appointed lieutenantcolonel the gentlemen of the northwest company army are forming a corps of their voyageurs who will be most useful troops to act in advance with the indians the number originally proposed was but the men have come forward so handsomely that they are to consist of mr m'gillivray is lieutenantcolonel commandant of this corps mr shaw major and the other partners of the company are captains and subalterns so that the men being commanded by those whom they have accustomed to obey may be considered as already disciplined at least in point of subordination sir george confines his operations to mere defence la motte with about indians advanced through the woods about ten days ago within hearing of this redoubtable army and set up a war whoop which so completely terrified them that though they could see no enemy they lay on their arms for two two successive nights in no expectation of an attack—to prevent which they cut down their best bridge and destroyed all the roads by which i suppose they mean to invade us mr — who was several days at their headquarters and who was offered the rank of lieutenantcolonel in the army has it is said proposed to sir george to destroy their camp with men and sir george is said to have replied that his plan was fixed not to make any attack nor to send a man across the line this forebearance which the yankees impute to fear or weakness tends only to increase their insolent swaggering and their enmity is to inveterate to be allayed by any thing but hard knocks the rota frigate arrived on monday off plymouth with a fleet from halifax under convoy and passed up the channel with the chief part of the trade from the hydra transport which put

their anchorage off the mouth of niagara river and with a fine breeze from the east stood towards our fleet which were becalmed off the port of twelve mile creek at sunset a breeze coming off the land

fleet formed a long the pike madison oneida and six schooners two schooners were placed to windward for the purpose of raking the masts of our squadron as it should come up at eleven the squadron got within gunshot of the schooners when they opened a brisk fire and from their going so fast it was more than an hour before the wolf our headmost ship could pass them at this time the rest of the squadron was two and three miles astern of the wolf and on her coming up with the madison and pike they put before the wind and made sail firing their sternchasers—sir j yeo finding it impossible to get the squadron up with the enemy as the wolf was the only ship which could keep up with them then made sail between them and the two schooners to windward which he captured and which are called the

material injury and not a person hurt the prisoners were landed on the th instant and the growler's damage repaired she had lost her bowsprit and was otherwise cut up nothing could exceed the

the latter lost one officer and men killed and taken prisoners—the whole of the medicines and instruments were brought off by the party of the king's the only loss sustained being three indians wounded captain norton led the indian warriors with great spirit and much credit is due to captain merrit of the provincial dragoons for reconnoitering the spot where the medicines were deposited and

capture of the little fleet on lake erie and the defeat of the s[]al british force under the [] of occupying the chapel and some other houses for our sick british soldiers and considering the danger the christian indians were in from the malice of the americans it was his advice that the missionaries and the indian congregation should retreat farther into the country when the americans were successful in the latter it became necessary to take steps of effect it the british behaved very kindly to the brethren and offered to purchase the houses and cottages but their defeat prevented it on entering the place the americans first pretended to be friendly and sorry that the indians had fled who had gone with mr and mrs denke one of the missionaries up the river mr and mrs schnall and the aged missionary michael young remained during the first night the americans already changed their tone or rather showed their real character they began to abuse the missionaries with curses and all manner of insults plundering the houses and general harrison to whom we appealed would grant no redress they took every thing that was away and under a pretence that king's stores and english goods were lodged in the houses ransacked every place and every trunk and chest belonging to individuals commodore perry who had defeated the mosquito fleet on the lake was there and behaved rather better

in the back ground the old defensive system is still adhered to and i fear much with all our reinforcements we shall do little good till we have another commander in chief there is now a great body of regular troops in this country and a handful of brave fellows have recently been almost sacrificed par la petite guerre at chippawa whilst in the lower province there are at least regulars doing nothing some of the officers of the regiments lately arrived from france do not conceal their sentiments—on inspecting one of the regiments the other day our chief took occasion as usual to make some remarks on the cut of the men's clothes when the colonel commanding stepped forward and told him plainly that such systems were now completely exploded—that he had had the honour of serving very lately under a much more celebrated general that it was probable he would ever serve under again—that his men had been accustomed to fight not to dance and if such was the plan he was called on to follow he should certainly retire from the service such language you may suppose was not very pleasing to our governor but i am happy to find that we now have military men amongst us who are not afraid to speak out as it appears the numberless representations of civilians are not much attended to montreal july i consider this country now as perfectly secure against any attempts that the americans may make not withstanding the system of our chief does not seem to be changed he has received a great many more troops this year than he had any idea of and does not seem pleased at having so large a force unhis command as the country will now look to him for some offensive operation against the enemy he has done nothing the whole summer but parade about men at chambly where he makes them march past him twice aweek bowing and scraping instead of employing them where they ought to be you will have heard of an american army of about under general jacob brown having crossed the river at fort erie when general rial with a force of only gallantly assailed them but was overpowered by numbers and sustained considerable loss i inclose a general order published yesterday about this unfortunate business whereby you will find that our loss has been great upon this frontier the americans have hardly any force and it appears very singular indeed that so great a body of men as are now on the other side of the river from sorel to isle aux noix at least men should be left for the purpose of parade when they are so much wanted in the upper province i sincerely hope that some investigation will take place into this business as it is really disgraceful to think that such an enemy should be able to make an attack upon us with impunity quebec sept the americans to the number of men landed and attacked fort michillimackinac in lake huron on the th august they were repulsed by the british garrison the american fort la prairie du chiens has been taken by the british this

army on the niagara frontier when he met with this accident on the st august the british troops broke their encampment at odell town near lake champlain and proceeded immediately to take possession of the position which the american army had just abandoned at the village of champlain this army was commanded by general izard and are said to have proceeded partly to plattsburgh and partly to

drummond th regiment and lieutenant colonel fischer of de watteville's the two former were directed to scale the fort and the latter to get possession of a small hill named snakehill which the americans had fortified and being situated only about eight hundred yards from fort erie was of consequence to us this latter column failed in their object but the two columns destined for the fort carried the same in a most gallant manner and obliged the enemy to retire into two stone blockhouses inside the fort when their own guns were turned against them at this time a most unfortunate explosion took place which blew up the magazine and battery and with them a number of our brave soldiers and the consternation caused by this was so great and we were obliged to abandon our conquest and retreat to our original position with great loss of both officers and men the large shipbuilding by the british at kingston on lake ontario is to be launched the second week in september—also will

sept from the northwestern frontier of upper canada messrs m'gillivray and m'leod who arrived here on thursday last have brought dispatches from lieutenant colonel m'donal at michillimackinac written since the repulse of the american forces sent there to recapture it the following are the particulars of that expedition — on the forenoon of the th of august the americans landed men or thereabouts at the back of the island dowsman's farm there is a considerable space of ground cleared and a gentle slope which enabled their vessels at anchor close to the beach to keep clear by a constant fire of grape &c and which by the situation of the ground passed directly over the men's heads as they formed and advanced towards the woods lieutenantcolonel m'doual[] formed his small garrison at most at the extremity of the woods and the indians were stationed on each flank to keep the enemy from outflanking the troops by a false account of the enemy's intention to land on another part of the island a certain number of indians were sent to watch their motions but more indians absenting themselves exposed one flank of lieutenantcolonnel m'doual's party entirely and an apprehension was entertained that the enemy would outflank and cut off the garrison from the forts it was therefore deemed expedient to fall back between the two forts and there await the advance of the enemy a party of between and indians placed on the left flank and ignorant of the movements in the centre and right flank fired on the americans and threw them into confusion which the indians soon perceived and encouraging each other by whoops and yells totally broke the little order still observed by the enemy who took instant flight and were all out of reach before lieutenantcolonel m'doual was apprised of their retreat thus was a body of at least from six to nine hundred men defeated and put to instant flight by or indians with a loss of men and a major holmes killed and found on the spot—the indians lost but one man previous to and combined with this the measures taken by the enemy were these on the [] of july a detachment of the expedition sent against michillimackinac by the enemy proceeded to st mary's where they met with no resistance there being neither troops nor indians and every person occupied about their usual concerns such as bay making fishing &c major holmes commanded the party who gave up to indiscriminate plunder and destroyed the whole of the property belonging to the north west company burning their houses stores and vessels killing their cattle and taking off their engagees prisoners tearing down the fences destroying the gardens fields &c many wanton acts of cruelty might be detailed let two suffice for the present mr johnstone's property was plundered even his furniture the very clothing of his wife and children was seized upon by these ruthless plunderers and carried away major holmes sent to the south side of the strait for mr johnstone's son george and after threatening and reviling him with the most oppobrious language flourished his sword over his head and said he had a great mind to cut his head off now he was his slave when they were in the act of burning the houses and stores mr g johnstone was ordered to stand in a certain spot under pain of being shot but had he remained sufforation[] must have been his fate being so near the buildings in flames he therefore risked being shot and came off and thereby effected a timely escape another instance of more than savage cruelty was exercised on a poor horse which they made us of all day in carting their plunder and in the evening whilst still tackled to the cart tied him to the end of the dwellinghouse then in flames and amused themselves in looking at the poor animal making vain efforts to get loose but there he was burnt and his bones seen there by the writer of this canada papers montreal oct the express from upper canada which arrived yesterday morning confirmed the highly satisfactory reports of the preceding day that the enemy had precipitately retreated on the th instant from before chippawa after destroying a quantity of provisions and heavy baggage and that on the st they had passed over to buffaloe a great part of their force and were blowing up the works at fort erie further accounts from kingston have been received this morning to the th instant when the official report of the enemy's retreat from fort erie after the destruction of the works had not reached that place but there was no doubt of the fact majorgenera de watteville commanded the corps pressing on the enemy the master of a mail which arrived at kingston on the th in twentyfour hours from fort george further confirms the previous intelligence and reports that several hundred prisoners were taken before the americans effected their escape across the river on the th the british came up with his rear guard and in a sharp action thirty of the americans were left on the field wihtout a casualty happening on our side this was at chippawa creek—the enemy then fled with the utmost precipitation to fort erie and began the destruction of his fortifications a military courier from kingston arrived this morning brings no additional news of importance—sir james yeo had returned to kingston with the sick of the army of niagara on board we again sailed for the head of the lake a private letter from niagara of the th instant says that a severe action took place the day before near chippawa our loss is stated at killed and wounded that of the enemy is supposed to be very considerable a field piece made to bear upon one of his columns did great execution another letter denies any loss in killed but makes the wounded or montreal nov from upper canada we have received nothing of importance the report of the whole american armies have crossed the niagara was a mistake as the last accounts from that quarter mention that general brown was still in possession of fort erie quebec nov we are in expectation of some further details of the operations on the niagara frontier by this day's montreal post but they had no arrived at one o'clock the evacuation by the enemy of our territory on that frontier is a striking illustration of the importance of the command of the lake the enemy did cross over to our side till the moment his fleet was ready to assume the superiority the reappearance of our fleet effected what could not be done by the expence of so much blood and treasure from the quebec gazette the american government has published the papers relating to the late negotations at ghent we confess that we have seen these papers with feelings of some satisfaction and much regret satisfaction that we can now say that the honour of the british government is pledged to do something for british interests in north american and regret that that something is so little the indians are to be made independent of both nations this is perfectly just and would under certain cirumstances greatly add to the security of these provinces the lakes are to be exclusively british on these subjects we must be permitted to ask how long they would be permitted to remain so how long the indians would retain their independence in the event of another war if the communication with them should be in the power of the enemy the sole communication for military purposes with the indians and the lakes is by the river st lawrence from montreal to kingston and from niagara to fort erie and the americans are to be permitted to remain in possession of one of its banks the enemy has hitherto been prevented from interrupting this communication by the thinness of the settlements of their side the consequent badness of the roads and difficulty of supplying a large force the possession of th southern bank of the st lawrence between montreal and kingson and the power of supplying themselves and operating on that frontier by the roads now existing and from lake champlain has been worth a large force to them during the whole of the war it has caused us to parcel our force to support the line of communication between lake st francis and kingston and keep a great proportion of it to protect the base of that line in the vicinity of montreal the position of canada relative to the united states with its present boundaries is an extraordinary one so much so that intelligent military men have pronounced it incapable of defence much beyond quebec the miserable state of the enemy's preparations the superiority which we then had on the lakes the good disposition of the inhabitants and the prudent conduct of the commander of the forces alone saved it the waste of means in protecting and conveying supplies by a communication of five hundred miles adjoining the whole way to the enemy's frontie is conceivable only to those whom experience has made acquainted with the fact or who are habituated to reflection and whenever the communication of the lakes becomes interrupted the supply of any force further advanced on the line becomes utterly impracticable the enemy derives his supplies either by the lakes upon which an army can effect nothing or from a settled country a long way in his rear protected by his army a country covered with woods and a militia more effective than the best troops in such a country always ready for the protection of their property and their houses—under such circumstances the weakness of an army beyond a certain point is to be counted by its numbers we scruple not to say that whenever that part of the state of new york extending to the st lawrence between lake ontario and lake champlain shall be fully settled the whole of upper canada must fall to the united states the lower canada will not be defensible but at an expence of means far beyond its value we had much rather see the americans confirmed in the possession of sackett's harbour presquile detroit and michilimackinac than in the possession of the tract of country just mentioned great britain will always have the means of establishing a superiority on the lakes whenever she chuses to exert them but she never will be able to drive the americans out of that frontier when once fully settled supported as they will be by the immense population of the back parts of the state of new york and adjoining states from the united states papers urbanna sept an express has arrived from detroit to general m'arthur in six days in which governor cass says— a state of things has arrived in which your presence with the force at your disposal is essential to the security and preservation of the country the indians have recommenced hostilities on every side of us they are murdering the people and breaking up the settlements there is now a large force of them in the immediate vicinity of this place most probably within a mile of it with the avowed purpose of attacking the town we have no force adequate to the defence of the country and none of description proper for the pursuit of the indians—my opinion is that you should hasten on with the mounted men with all possible expedition the express came by water the land communiation being entirely cut off albany oct the legislature of this state adjourned yesterday after a session of four weeks the principal laws passed are an act to authorise the raising of troops for the

their intention to pay clothe and subsist them at their expence the privateer bill authorises associations to incorporate themselves for the purpose of fitting out privateers the following resolution introduced by mr monell passed both houses of our legislature unanimously on saturday— resolved unanimously—that the house of assembly of the state of new york view with mingled emotions of surprise and indignation the extravagant and disgraceful terms proposed by the british commissioners at ghent—that however ardently they may desire the restoration of peace to their country they can never consent to receive it at the sacrifice of national honour and dignity—that they therefore strongly recommend to the national legislature the adoption of the vigorous and efficacious measures in the prosecution of the war as the best means of the bringing the contest to an honourable termination and of transmitting unimpaired to their posterity their rights liberty and independence the following is a private letter which was brought by the liffey montreal nov sir george prevost reached kingston on the th october where his presence has been of the utmost importance chauncey resigned his

and attempted to cross the chippawa about six miles from its mouth where they were met with by a corps of about troops under colonel meyers who faced them most manfully they skirmished the whole day in which the glengarries supported their high character and in the evening jonathan finding himself foiled and unable to bring up his artillery from the horrid state of the roads retired again to the main body at black creek our casualties on this occasion were triflin—those of the enemy were said to have been considerable though he refrained from exposing himself to our fire in the open ground we had two fieldpieces there and whenever the enemy showed a column out of the wood a welldirected discharge soon obliged them to return to their shelter by this time our fleet being announced gave alarm to the enemy and they commenced a precipitate retreat to fort erie they were purused on the th and st by our advance under majorgeneral watteville close to fort erie where he found them occupying the high ground which general drummond had not left many weeks before and could push no further at the date of the last accounts from general drummond jonathan still maintained his post from which it will require a few columns of fresh troops to dislodge him but as they are now on their way to join the right dividion i trust i shall in a short time have the pleasure to acquaint you of the complete expulsion of the enemy from the niagara frontier it is said that for want of sufficient shelter a part of general izard's force had crossed to buffalo and that they had passed over some heavy artillery and stores leaving at the fort such a force as they conceived capable of defending it sir james brough down with him the skeleton of the st battalion of the king's regiment and the remains of the two flank companies of the th he sailed again on the st inst taking with him about men comprising the th a brigade of artillery a pounder and detachments from the th and d regiments and a large

and would attempt another before the navigation closed a reinforcement had been sent under capt bulgar to praire du chain the arrangements necessary for reinforcing and supplying general drummond's army being completed and the attack upon sackett's harbour being deemed impracticable this season sir george returned last evening to this place his journey to kingston has certainly had the effect of inducing general brown with a considerable part of his force to move to sackett's harbour and has thus left general izard so much weakened at fort erie that i have little doubt of the result of an attack upon him i am sorry to see that the malice of a certain party here has been at work at your side of the water it has increased tenfold since the expression of the public sentiment in favour of his excellency by the addresses which are now preparing and which i can assure you is the real and unsolicited voice of the people i am happy to find that general kempt is going to england as he will afford true information upon the state of the country and be able to exposethe falsehoods which have been circulated respecting recent events new south wales a journey into the interior of new south wales across the blue mountains performed by his excellency colonel mac quarrie governor of the settlement from the official account dated sydney june the governor desires to communicate for the information of the public the result of his late tour over the western or blue mountains undertaken for the purpose of being enabled personally to appreciate the importance of the track of country lying westward of them which had been explored in the latter end of the year and beginning of by mr george william evans deputy surveyor of lands to those who know how very limited a track of country has been hitherto occupied by the colonists of new south walves extending along the eastern coast to the north and south of port jackson only miles and westward about miles to the foot of that chain of mountains in the interior which forms its western boundary it must be a subject of astonishment and regret that amongst so large a population no one appeared within the first twentyfive years of the establishment of this settlement possessed of sufficient energy of mind to induce him fully to explore a passage over these mountains but when it is considered that for the greater part of that time even this circumscribed portion of country afforded sufficient produce for the wants of the people whilst on the other hand the whole surface of the country beyond those limits was a thick and in many places nearly an impenetrable forest the surprise at the want of effort to surmount such difficulties must abate very considerably the records of the colony only afford two instances of any bold attempt having been made to discover the country to the westward of the blue mountains the first was by mr bass and the other by mr caley and both ended in disappointment a cirumstance which will not be much wondered at by those who have lately crossed these mountains to gregory blaxland and william wentworth esqrs and liutenant lawson of the royal veteran company the merit is due of having with extraordinary patience and much fatigu effected the first passage over the most rugged and difficult part of the blue mountains the governor being strongly impressed with the importance of the object had early after his arrival in this colony formed the resolution of encouraging the attempt to find a passage to the western country and willingly availed himself of the facilities which the discoveries of these three gentlemen afforded him accordingly on the th of november he entrusted the accomplishment of this object to mr george william evans deputy surveyor of lands the result of whose journey was laid before the public through the medium of the sydney gazette on the th of february the favourable account given by mr evans of the country he had explored induced the governor to cause a road to be constructed for the passage and conveyance of cattle and provisions to the interior and men of good character from amongst a number of convicts who had volunteered their services were selected to perform this arduous work on condition of being fed and clothed during the continuance of their labour and being granted emancipations as their final reward on the completion of the work the direction and superintendence of this great work was entrusted to william cox esq the chief magistrate at windsor and to the astonishment of every one who knows what was to be encountered and sees what has been done he effected its completion in six months from the time of its commencement happily without the loss of a man or any serious accident the governor is at a loss to appreciate fully the services rendered by mr cox to this colony in the execution of this arduous work which promises to be of the greatest public utility by opening a new source of wealth to the industrious and enterprising when it is considered that mr cox voluntarily relinquished the comforts of his own house and the society of his numerous family and exposed himself to much personal fatigue with only such temporary covering as the bark hut could afford from the inclemency of the season it is difficult to express the sentiments of approbation to which such privations and services are entitled mr cox having reported the road as completed on the st of january the governor accompanied by mrs macquarrie and that gentleman commenced his tour on the th of april last over the blue mountains and was joined by sir john jamieson at the nepean who accompanied him during the entire tour the following gentlemen composed the governor's suite mr campbell secretary captain antill major of brigade lieutenant watts aide decamp mr redfern assistantsurgeon mr oxley surveyorgeneral mr mehan deputy surveyorgeneral mr lewin painter and naturalist and mr g evans deputy surveyor of lands who had been sent forward for the purpose of making further discoveries and rejoined the party on the day of arrival at bathurst plains the commencement of the ascent from emu plains to the first depot and thence to a resting place now called spring wood distant twelve miles from emu ford was through a very handsome open forests of lofty trees and much more practicable and easy than was expected the facility of the ascent for this distance excited surprise and is certainly not well calculated to give the traveller a just idea of the difficulties he has afterwards to encounter at a further disstance of four miles a sudden change is perceived in the appearance of the timber and the quality of the soil the former becoming stunted and the latter barren and rocky at this place the fatigues of the journey may be said to commence here the country became altogether mountainous and extremely rugged near to the th mile it is to be observed that the measure commences at emu ford a pile of stones attracted attention it is close to the line of road on the top of a rugged and abrupt ascent and is supposed to have been placed there by mr caley as the extreme limit of his tour hence the governor gave that part of the mountain the name as caley's[] repulse to have penetrated even so far was at that time an effort of no small difficulty from henceforward to the th mile is a succession of steep and rugged hills some of which are almost so abrupt as to deny a passage altogether but at this place a considerable extensive plain is arrived at which constitutes the summit of the western mountains and from thence a most extensive and beautiful prospect presents itself on all sides to the eye the town of windsor the river hawkesbury prospect hill and other objects within that part of the colony now inhabited of equal interest are distinctly seen from hence the majestic grandeur of the situation combined with the various objects to be seen from this place induced the governor to give it the appellation of the king's table land on the southwest side of the king's table land the mountain terminates in abrupt precipices of immense depth at the bottom of which is seen a glen as romantically beautiful as can be imagined bounded on the further side by mountains of great magnitude terminating equally abruptly as the others and the whole thickly covered with wood the length of this picturesque and remarkable track of country is about miles to which the governor gave the name of the prince regent's glen proceeding hence to the thirtythird mile on the top of a hill an opening presents itself on the southwest side of the prince regent's glen from whence a view is obtained particularly beautiful and grand—mountains rising beyond mountains with stupendous masses of rock in the fore ground here strike the eye with admiration and astonishment the circular form in which the whole is so wonderfully disposed induced the governor to give the name of pitt's amphitheatre in honour of the right hon william pitt to this offset of branch from the prince regent's glen the road continues from hence for the space of miles on the ridge of the mountain which forms one side of the prince regent's glen and there it suddenly terminates in nearly a perpendicular precipice of feet high as ascertained by measurement the road constructed by mr cox down this rugged and tremendous descent through all its windings is no less than threefourths of a mile in length and has been executed with such skill and stability as reflects much credit on him the labour here undergone and the difficulties surmounted can only be appreciated by those who view this scene in order to perpetuate the memory of mr cox's services the governor deemed it a tribute justly due to him to give his name to this grand and extraordinary pass and he accordingly called it cox's pass having descended into a valley at the bottom of this pass the retrospective view of the overhanging mountain is magnificently grand although the present pass is the only practicable point yet discovered for descending by yet the mountain is much higher than those on either side of it from whence it is distinguished at a considerable distance when approaching it from the interior and in this point of view it has the appearance of a very high distinct hill although it is in fact only the abrupt termination of a ridge the governor gave the name of mount york to this termination of the ridge in honour of his royal highness the duke of york on descending cox' pass the governor was much gratified by the appearance of good pasture land and soil fit for cultivation which was the first he had met with since the commencement of his tour the valley at the base of mount york he called the vale of clwyd in consequence of the strong resemblance it bore to the vale of that name in north wales the grass in this vale is of a good quality and very []dant and a rivulet of fine water runs along it from the eastward which unites itself at the western extremity of the vale with another rivulet containing still more water the junction of these two streams forms a very handsome river now called by the governor cox's river which takes its course as has been since ascertained through the prince regent's glen and empties itself into the river nepean and it is conjectured from the nature of the country through which it passes that it mut be one of the principal causes of the floods which have been occasionally felt on the low banks of the river hawkesbury into which the nepean discharges itself the vale of clwyd from the base of mount york extends six miles in a westerly direction and has its termination at cox's river westward of this river the country again becomes hilly but it is generally open forest land and very good passage three miles to the westward of the vale of clwyd messrs blaxland wentworth and lawson had formerly terminated their excursion and when the various difficulties are considered which they had to contend with especially until they had effected the descent from mount york to which place they were obliged to pass through a thick brushwood where they were under the necessity of cutting a passage for their baggage horses the severity of which labour had seriously affected their healths their patient endurance of such fatigue cannot fail to excite much surprise and admiration in commemoration of their merits three beautiful high hills joining each other at the end of their tour at this place have receieved their names in the following order viz mount blaxland wentworth's sugar loaf and lawson's sugar load a range of very lofty hills and narrow vallies alternately form the track of country from cox's river for a distance of miles until the fish river is arrived at and the stage between these rivers is consequently very severe and oppressive on the cattle to this range the governor gave the name of clarence hilly range proceeding from the fish river and at a short distance from it a very singular and beautiful mountain attracts the attentions its summit being crowned with a large and very extraordinary looking rock nearly circular in form which gives the whole very much the appearance of a hill fort such as are frequent in india to this lofty hill mr evans who was the first european discoverer gave the name of mount evans passing on from hence the country continues hilly but affords good pasturage gradually improving to sidmouth valley which is distant from the pass of the fish river eight miles the land here is level and the first met with unencumbered with timber it is not of very considerable extent but abounds with a great variety of herbs and plants such as would probably highly interest and gratify the scientific botanist the beautiful little valley runs northwest and southeast between hills of easy ascent thinly covered with timber leaving sidmouth valley the country becomes again hilly and in other respects resembles very much the country to the eastward of the valley for some miles having reached campbell river distant miles from sidmouth valley the governor was highly gratified by the appearance of the country which there began to exhibity an open and extensive view of gently rising grounds and fertile plains judging from the height of the banks and its general width the campbell river must be on some occasions of very considerable magnitude but the extraordinary drought which has apparently prevailed on the western side of the mountains equally as throughout this colony for the last three years has reduced this river so much that it may be more properly called a chain of pools than a running stream at the present time in the reaches or pools of the campbell river the very curious animal called the paradox or water mole is seen in great numbers the soil on both banks is uncommonly rich and the grass is consequently luxuriant two miles to the southward of the line of road which crosses the campbell river there is a very fine rich track of low lands which has been named mitchell plains flax was found here growing in considerable quanities the fish river which forms a junction with the campbell river a few miles to the northward of the road and bridge over the latter has also two very fertile plains on its banks the one called o'connel plains and the other macquarrie plains both of considerable extent and very capable of yielding all the necessities of life at the distance of seven miles from the bridge over the campbell river bathurst plains open to the view presenting a rich track of champaign country of miles in length bounded on both sides by gently rising and very beautiful hills thinly wooded the macquarrie river which is constituted by the junction of the fish and campbell river takes a winding course through the plains which can be easily traced from the high lands ajoining by the particular verdure of the trees on its banks which are likewise the only trees throughout the extent of the plains the level and clean surface of these plains gives them at first view very much the appearance of lands in a state of cultivation it is impossible to behold this grand scene without a feeling of admiration and surprise whilst the silence and solitude which reign in a space of such extent and beauty as seems designed by nature for the occupancy and comfort of man created a degree of melancholy in the mind which may be more easily imagined than described the governor and suite arrived at these plains on thursday the th of may and encamped on the southern or left bank of the macquarrie river—the situation being selected in consequence of its commanding a beautiful and extensive prospect for many miles in every direction around it at this place the governor remained for a week which time he occupied in making excursions in different directions through the adjoining country on both sides the river on sunday the th of may the governor fixed on a site suitable for the erection of a town at some future period to which he gave the name of bathurst in honour of the present secretary of state for the colonies the situation of bathurst is elevated sufficiently beyond the reach of any floods which may occur and is at the same time so near to the river on its south bank as to derive all the advantages of its clear and beautiful stream the mechanics and settlers of whatever description who may be hereafter permitted to form permanent residences to themselves at this place will have the highly important advantages of a rich and fertile soil with a beautiful river flowing through it for all the uses of man the governor mut however add that the hopes which were once so sanguinely entertained of this river becoming navigable to the western sea have ended in disappointment during the week that the governor remained at bathurst he made daily excursions in various directions one of these extended miles in a southwest direction and on that occasion as well as on all the others he found the country chiefly composed of vallies and plains separated occasionally by ranges of low hills the soil throughout being generally fertile and well circumstanced for the purpose of agriculture or grazing the governor here feels much pleasure in being enabled to communicate to the public that the favourable reports which he had received of the country to the west of the blue mountains have not been by any means exaggerated the difficulties which present themselves in the journey from hence are certainly great and inevitable but thsoe persons who may be inclined to become permanent settlers there will probably content themselves withvisiting this part of the colony but rarely and of course will have them seldom to encounter plenty of water and a sufficiency of grass are to be found in the mountains for the support of such cattle as may be sent over them and the tracks of fertile soil and rich pasturage which the new country affords are fully extensive enough for any increase of population and stock which can possibly take place for many years within a distance of ten miles from the site of bathurst there is not less than acres of land clear of timber and fully one half of that may be considered excellent soil well calculated for cultivation it is a matter of regrets that in proportion as the soil improves the timber degenerates and it is to be remarked that everywhere to the westward of the mountains it is much inferior both in size and quality to that within the present colony there is however a sufficiency of timber of tolerable quality within the district around bathurst for the purposes of housebuilding and husbandry the governor has here to lament that neither coals nor limestone have been yet discovered in the western country articles in themselves of so much importance that the want of them must be severely felt whenever that country shall be settled having enumerated the principal and most important features of this new country the governor has now to notice some of its live productions all around bathurst abounds in a variety of game and the two principal rivers contain a great quantity of fish but all of one denomination resembling the perch in appearance and of a delicate and fine flavour not unlike that of a rock cod this fish grows to a large size and is very voracious several of them were caught during the governor's stay at bathurst and at the halting place on the fish river one of those caught weight lb and the people stationed at bathurst stated that they had caught some weighing lb the field game are the kangaroos emus black swans wild geese wild turkies bustards ducks of various kinds quail bronze and other pigeons &c &c the water mole or paradox also abounds in all the rivers and ponds the site designed for the towns of bathurst by observation taken at the flag staff which was erected on the day of bathurst receiving that name is situated in latitude south being also miles north of government house in sydney and west of it bearing west north geographic miles or statute miles the measured road distance from sydney to bathurst being english miles the road constructed by mr cox and the party under him commences at emu ford on the left bank of the river nepean and is thence carried miles to the flag staff at bathurst this road has been carefully measured and each mile regularly marked on the trees growing on the left side of the road proceeding towards bathurst the governor in his tour made the following stages in which he was principally regulated by the consideration of having good pasturage for the cattle and plenty of water — st stage—spring wood distant from emu ford miles d stage ditto—jamieson's valley or d depot distant from ditto d ditto—blackheath distant from ditto th ditto—cox's river distant from ditto th ditto—the fish river distant from ditto th ditto—sidmouth valley distant from ditto th ditto—campbell river distant from ditto th ditto—bathurst distant from ditto at all of which places the traveller may assure himself of good grass and water in abundance on thursday the th of may the governor and suite set out from bathurst on their return and arrived at sidney on friday the th ult the governor deems it expedient here to notify to the public that he does not mean to make any grants of land to the westward of the blue mountains until he shall receive the commands of his majesty's ministers on that subject and in reply to the report he is now about to make them upon it in the mean time such gentlemen or other respectable free persons as may wish to visit this new country will be permitted to do so on making a written application to the governor to that effect who will order them to be furnished with written passes it is at the same time strictly ordered and directed that no person whether civil or military shall attempt to travel over the blue mountains without having previously applied for and obtained permission in the above prescribed form the military guard stationed at the first depot on the mountains will receive full instructions to prevent the progress of any persons who shall not have obtained regular passes the necessity for the establishing and strictly enforcing this regulation is too obvious to every one who will reflect on it to require any explanation here the governor cannot conclude this account of his tour without offering his best ackowledgements to william cox esq for the important services he has rendered to the colony in so short a period of time by opening a passage to the new discovered country and at the same time assuring him that he shall have great pleasure in recommending his meritorious services on this occasion to the favourable consideration of his majesty's ministers colonial population we lay before our readers the following extracts from the latest official returns of populattion ordered to

papers montreal oct on the afternoon of saturday last the specie seized on board the lake champlain steamboat amounting to upward of dollars arrived at his majesty's cashoffice here under the escort of the th light dragoons from st john's at length we have authentic accounts relating to the expedition of lord selkirk they are very important as many ex parte details have been published his taking fort william by storm making all the partners of the north west company prisoners &c but the cause of the expe dition has never been explained the canadian courant puts it in a very clear point of view—mr robert semple the governorgeneral the hudson's bay company on the red river towards the close of the year took possession of two establishments belonging to the north west company which had obtruded themselves on the territory of the hudson's bay company the north west traders then altered their route going into the upper country by circuitous ways by which much delay took place and in order to try mr semple they sent two cartloads of provisions by the former track in june last with a guard of fifty men the advance twentytwo of the number fell in with one of the natives whom they took forward with them to prevent discovery the rearguard passed within four miles of the settlement they were perceived by the governor and were attacked by a party from the garrison consisting of about thirty soldiers an engagement took place stated on the th of june mr semple and of his men were killed the rest of his forces returned defeated to the fort it is on this account that the expedition of lord selkirk was undertaken the manner of lord selkirk's conducting the expedition we do not justify nor indeed can we form any opinion on the subject without further authentic details it is however but justice to say that the hudson's bay company have rights and are a chartered company the north west traders though we believe a most respectable body are only an association of merchants canada lord selkirk we have been favoured by a gentleman in this city with the following interesting and authentic communication on the subject of the dispute between lord selkirk and the gentlemen of the north west company extract of a letter from montreal dated th october in the newspapers which i sent you you will see some accounts of the disturbances which have taken place in the north west between the north west company and lord selkirk's colonists the latter have been obliged to leave the red river after having had of their men including governor semple killed by a party of halfbreeds the spurious offspring of the north west company as yet have not had an accurate statement of that melancholy transaction lord selkirk's party state that these halfbreed with some of the north west company servants came to destroy the settlement and that mr semple with about of the colonists went out to meet them to know what could be their intentions when those rascals commenced firing on them and massacred all but three who were fortunate enough to make their escape the north west people's account is that these halfbreeds with some indians were bringing down provisions from the upper part of the red river to the entrance near lake winipie and as the colonists had the command of a great part of the river they were obliged to pass in the rear of the settlement which being observed by governor semple who was on the lookout for them he settled out of his fort with men and a []piece to take from the indians the provisions which were intended for the north west company that the result[] was an engagement which terminated in the defeat of the colonists of whom twentytwo were killed lord selkirk [] from montreal for the red river about the latter end of june when[] three or four officers and about men of de men[]'s regiment which had been disbanded and when he arrived at fort william on lake superior hearing the fate of his colonists he[] immediately issued a warrant against mr m'gillivray for high treason conspiracy and murder and subsequently warrants against all the partners of the n w company who were at f william [] formal possession of their establishment there and sent mr m'gillivray with about ten others prisoners to montreal with all their papers [] a number of packs of beaver and other furs and several bales[] of merchandise which he found in possession of the north west company belonging to the hudson's bay company the police officers in montreal were several days examining the papers and about four or five days after the arrival of mr m'gillivray and the others they were admitted to bail to appear to take their trial at the next criminal court or any court of oyer and terminer which may be appointed stuart the cide vant solicitorgeneral who was dismissed by sir james craig and at whose instance an ineffectual attempt was lately made by some misguided members of our house of assembly to impeach chief justices sewell and monk is one of lord selkirk's counsel and spoke at great length and what his friends and admirers call very eloquently strongly opposed their being admitted to bail but all would not do and they were accordingly bailed mr m'gillivray in sureties of t and the others in t sums inconsiderable enough advering to the high crimes and misdemeanours with which they were charged in the montreal herald you will see a very learned and as our neighbour jonathan would say a lengthy communication signed montius[] setting forth the rights which the hudson's bay company by their charter possess over the countries which they have granted to lord selkirk and the power vested in him of appointing governors and other officers to superintend and regulate the colony being a masterly production it will no doubt makes its appearance in a pamphlet and when it does i shall send you one in case the papers should miscarry it is uncertain whether the earl will remain in the north west during the winter or come down to montreal if the latter he must be down[] soon[] as the season for watertravelling will shortly close montreal is now divided into two parties one favouring the lord and the other the north west company and with the exception of the friends of the latter strongly in favour of his lordship emigration to america [ extracted from no of cobbet's register published on saturday th instant ] cobbett's arrival in america&c on wednesday evening the th march we embarked on board the importer d ogden master bound to new york where we arrived on the th of may with about steerage passengers farmers and tradesmen who were fleeing from ruin and starvation in all respects that can be named our passage disagreeable and upon one occasion very perilous from lightning which struck the ship twice shivered two of the masts killed a man struck several people slightly between two of whom i was sitting without at all feeling the blow some of our fellowpassengers have found great disappointment and it is stated in some of the public papers here that many hundreds have during the last year accepted of the offer of our consul at new york to go and settle in canada you know that i have never advised any body to emigrate i have always said that it is no place for manufacturers no place for men to live without work no place for a farmer who does not work himself no place in short for any one who is not able and willing to work at the ordinary sorts of work but for such men there is every where a plentiful happy and easy life none should come however who have any views of idleness and even for the industrious poor i see no reason why they should expend their last shilling and undergo all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage in order to save those who eat the taxes the expence of their share of poorrates a man and his wife and a child or two cannot come under the expence of guineas at least a single man guineas before he gets into work again and as i always said i never would if i were in the place of such a man expend my earnings on a sea voyage and endure all its hardships in order to remove one eye sore out of the way of corruption besides there is the climate which is not so good as ours though it is not bad and people often live to an old age the country is good but it will easily be conceived that new face an entire new scene a separation from every friend work done in a quite different way from it is in england it will easily be conceived that all this makes such a dislocation in a man's mind as to make him very unhappy for a while then he cannot expect to find work the first day he must ask first at any rate englishmen are sheepish and they are sure to find rascals enough here to foster their disgust merely for the sake of serving the cause of corruption at home in short i advice nobody to emigrate but i will truly describe the country and the people as to emigrating with a view of settling and farming in the new countries it is neither more nor less than downright madness it is what our english farmers know nothing at all about it is what they are not at all fit for and the far greater part of all such speculations end in disappointment if not in ruin and premature death i hope that our beloved country will shortly be fit for an honest and industrious man to live in but if any farmers come with money in their pockets my advice is not to give way either to enthusiastic admiration or to instant disgust but to stop a little to look about them to see not only after good land but a good market for its products the western romance writers tell us that the land in the ohio is too good but mr mellish in his valuable book tells us that beef and pork sell for three halfpence a pound an excellent country for people who want to do nothing but eat —give me long island where the land is not too good but where beef and pork sell for about eightpence a pound i speak of english money where good hay sells for five pounts a ton and where there is a ready market for every species of produce one thing above all if an english farmer i mean by english people of the whole of the united kingdom comes here with money in his pocket let him resolve to keep it there for a year and then he will be sure to do well —all that i see around me here is well calculated to attract the attention and to please the sight of one like myself brought up in the country always greatly delighted with and somewhat skilled in various pleasing and healthful pursuits the the people are engaged busily in planting their indian corn the cherry trees of which there are multitudes planted in long avenues or rows or round the fields have dropped their blossom and begin to show their loads of fruit the apple and pear orchards in extent from one to twenty acres on each farm are in full and beautiful bloom the farms are small in extent no appearance of want amongst the labourers who receive in the country about two shillings and threepence our money aday with board and lodging and which board consists of plenty of excellent meat and fish of all sorts the best of bread butter cheese and eggs that you may form some idea as to prices of living i will state a few facts which have already come within my own knowledge we are at present at an inn thirteen miles from new york it is on the road to that city scarcely an hour in the day passes without a carriage of some sort offering for going thither and to go by the regular stage costs three shillings mind i shall always speak in english money when i do not speak of dollars we lodge and board in this inn have each a bedroom and good bed have a room to sit in ourselves we eat by ourselves and it really is eating — we have smoked fish chops butter and eggs for breakfast with bread the very finest i ever sa crackers sweet cakes and when i say that we have such and such things i do not mean that we get them for show or just enough to smell to but in loads not an egg but a dish full of eggs not a snip of meat or of fish but a plateful lump sugar for our tea and coffee not broke into little bits the size of a hazle nut but in good thumping pieces for dinner we have the finest of fish bass mackerel lobsters of meat lamb veal ham &c asparagus in plenty apple pieces through in the middle of may the supper is like the breakfast with preserved peaches and other things and with all this an excellent cyder to drink with the kindest and most obliging treatment on the part of the landlord and landlady and their sons and daughters we pay no more than s d a week each in england the same food and drink and lodging at an inn would cost us nearly the same sum every day but there are two things which no money can purchase any where the first is no grumbling on the part of the landlady except on account of our eating and drinking too little and the other is that mr wiggins has no fastening but a bit of chip run in over the latch of the door to a house which is full of valuable things of all sorts and about which we leave all our things much more carelessly than we should do in our own house in any part of england here then are we able to live at an inn one of the most respectable in the whole country at the rate of fifty pounds a year while the pay of a common farming man is not much short of that sum emigration the authenticity of the following details of the miseries endured by some german emigrants proceeding from amsterdam to america is we are told guaranteed otherwise they are almost too shocking to admit to belief libson nov we have just been witnesses here of an event which has renewed those gloomy reflexions which the friends of humanity have indulged ever since the commencement of the emigration from germany and switzerland to america we have deplored the error which led so great a number of unhappy persons to expartiate themselves in the hope of finding a happier lot upon the shores of the new world but it is less to the blindness of the victims of this error than to the abominable speculations of cupidity that we are to attribute these numerous emigrations the misery of the people of germany and switzerland occasioned by a superabundance of population and by the bad harvests of late years serves for aliment to the avarice of certain men who seek to establish criminal projects upon bases almost as obnoxious as those of the former slave trade such calculations deserve the attention of governments and it is with this view that we think is our duty to make known the fate of an expedition of this kind fitted out at amsterdam last august but we shall first transcribe from the original the article of the charter party relative to the power reserved by the captain over the persons of the passengers as inlcuding stipulations which are most characteristic of the nature of that odious traffic — we passengers promise to fulfil faithfully the following conditions— with respect to the price of the passage above stipulated for so much as we have not yet paid we engage to gain by our labour in america what we owe and we who owe the whole amount of our passage are bound if required and if we are unable to find better conditions to hire ourselves for four or five years in order to pay for our passage and we who have only paid for a part of our passage equally promise to let ourselves out to work for the same time for the sum we still owe we promise besides we passengers men or women fathers or mothers children and families here assembled the children for their parents the parents for their children the brother for his brother and the sister for her sister when we shall find an opportunity to employ ourselves in america to engage ourselves in service and to answer for one for the other one for all the others whether he be of our family or not so that the price of the passage be diminished or augmented as much as shall be necessary until we all and our families have employment and the captain be no loser by us knowing very well that we passengers who have children a family brothers and sisters ought all to sumbit to our wives or husbands our children our brothers our sisters being sent separately to whatever place in order to gain in private service profession or labour or in any manner that shall be deemed best the price of our passage and in order that we may not in any case refused the engagements proposed to us or contract others without the permission not knowledge of the capain it is agreed for those who have not yet paid for their passage for those who still owe part and for those who cannot find an engagement that they must consent to me the captain carrying them to such place in america as it shall please me and wherever i may find it expedient to proceed or wherever it may suit me to sail these horrible conditions were signed by passengers they had contracted with the captain of a dutch ship which was to proceed first to baltimore she in the worst state when she sailed from amsterdam and in defiance of the clauses of the contract by which the captain had engaged to feed them properly during the voyage he had not even embarked the necessary quanitity of provisions for after days navigation the leaks had so gained upon the ship that she was in danger of sinking and famine had already made frightful ravages it was at the end of that time and in this deplo rable condition that she was forced into belem near lisbon long before her arrival on our coasts the passengers had been reduced to the greatest misery not more by the small quantity than by the bad quality of the provisions the water was gone and seawater was their only drink so much had they been wasted that forty had already died of famine among the rest there were a great many sick some of who have died since their arrival in portugal the situation of the vessel had at first given great alarm to our council of health who apprehensive of contagion were for an instant fearful that it would be necessary to force her out to sea that would have been a misery so much the more formidable because the ship was not in a state to keep the sea and all must infallibly have perished happily this was deemed unnecessary and a quarantine was ordered the regency of lisbon determined that provisions and other succours should be furnished at the expence of the state all the consuls were most active and benevolent in affording assistance such was the result of the expedition many others have no doubt answered as little the expectations of those who seduced by deceitful promises have emigrated to america in search of happiness which they could not find abandoning their country their parents and their friends in july a hamburgh ship with swiss passengers was at lisbon in nearly the same distress with the dutch ship it is said here that there is a company in holland which has numerous agents to seduce men to emigrate it heaps them pell mell on board ships and if they reach their destination they are soon convinced of the fallacy of all their hopes it would be a desirable thing for papers in countries where these emigrations are excited to insert the article relative to the charter party given above in order that the simple and credulous may see what they have to undergo extract of a letter from the agent to at the cape of good hope dated th nov — the following most daring instance of piracy was committed in our harbour on the th inst viz— the elizabeth white lying at anchor off robin island with about tons of oil on board was boarded at about one a m by a party of armed deserters from his majesty's th regiment and convicts about in number i e five soldiers and seven convicts who after securing the hatches &c obtained possession of the ship and in the same instant cut the cables loosed the sails and favoured by a strong s e wind succeeded in carrying her off at six am the captain and crew having refused to listen to their invitation to join them in their piratical undertaking with the exception of the mate were permitted to leave the ship in the boat which reached robin island in safety about four o'clock the same day by a letter received today we learn that the admiral gambier brash laden with government stores for ceylon was totally lost on the morning of the th of june last having struck on the reef roan de nova in the mozambique channel crew saved a letter from halifax dated the th nonember says — colonel bouchette surveyor general of lower canada with captain campbell of the th regiment and mr bouchette jun arrived here on the th inst the only information i can yet give you is that the exploring survey has been extended from the source of the st croix river to the river restigouche in line about miles in this short distance both parties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the severest nature the americans employed on the same line with our english commissioners are represented as men of great ability and acting with that spirit of liberality that infuses confidence on each side rendering their arduous task less severe and gloomy than was to have been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this quarter our trade continues dull and money scarce government bills are per cent advance but expected to be lower in consequence of the commissarygeneral having refused to take the provincial notes fire in sheerness dockyard—on friday night about halfpast nine o'clock this place was thrown into the greatest consternation by the ringing of the alarm bells in the dockyard the beating of drums and the firing of the men of war's guns it was occasioned by a fire having broken out in the house belonging to the steam engine erected for carrying on the new works situated in the southern part of the dock yard near the kilns used for burning cement stone the most serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the arsenal and what was more distressing to the feelings of the spectators was its coniguity to the workhouse which from the pressure of the times and want of employment is crowded with many unfortunate individuals providence however averted the impending danger and about twelve o'clock we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames subdued with only the loss of the enginehouse no lives it is understood have been lost but one poor man is severely hurt captain walker of the northumberland and the officers of that ship liutenant griffin of the swan cutter and captain brown and the officers of the ordinary with the military officers and soldiers of the garrison assembled on the first alarm the latter were under arms the whole time and were of great service in keeping off the spectators the inhabitants of the twon were at one time under serious apprehensions as the fire was not far from the fountain tavern and the residence of mr miller in high street at the former the landlady of the house had but recently lain in and was removed on the first alarm being given sir robert barlow from chatham who superintends during the absence of commissioner boyle was here yesterday to investiage into the cause which it is suspected arose from carlessness —the damage however has not been so great as was at first expected and which it might have been but for the prompt and effectual assistance that was given —sheerness january new york and other american papers have been received to the th december — in the house of representatives on the th mr johnson brought forward a series of resolutions relative to the military establish the principal of which is the following — that the military peace establishment of the united states shall consist hereafter of eight thousand men including the corps of invalids provided that the corps of engineers the general staff and ordnance department shall be retained as at present established provided also that no part of the army shall be disbanded in consequence of said reduction but the same shall be effected by permitting vacancies as they occur to remain — that it is expedient to provide by law for an additional national armoury to be located on the western waters that it is expedient to organise by law a corps of invalids to be composed of one thousand men the following resolution relative to foreign seamen was also proposed and adopted without opposition resolved that the committee of commerce and manufactures be instructed to inquire into the expediency of providing by law for the apprehending and securing foreign seamen deserting from foreign vessels while in the ports of the united states contrary to their engagements to serve on board such vessels irish emigrants new york nov nothing scarcely can be conceived more distressing than the situation of an unfriended stranger arrived here from across the atlantic without the means of helping himself and without even enough of acquaintance with the men and things about him to enable him to judge what path he should take to secure him the miseries of absolute want such however is actually the situation of hundres who annually land on our shores to provide for those forlorn beings several attempts have been made by associations of humane individuals here but nothing hitherto has appeared to promising as that of which an account here follows — at a meeting of irishmen and descendents of irishmen held at harmony hall on tuesday the th instant for the purpose of promoting a settlement of irish emigrants andrew morris chairman wm sampson secretary upon the motion of thomas addis emmett the circular previously issues on this subject was read by the secretary — circular it is a sentiment long felt and often expressed that something should be undertaken on behald of the emigrants who flock to these shores without any fixed destination they remain in the sea port until beocming victims of bad counsel and bad example they lose the pure and honest energies with which they left their native land and suffer worse than shipwreck in their moral qualities the government of this great republic is well aware of the advantage to be derived from so great a mass of laborious industry when usefully directed and employed—and of adding to the nation's strength men whose attachment to the institutions of this country is assured by so many ties but it is in the order of things that some of the friends particularly the countrymen of these emigrants who have been some time established and known should come forward to attest the necessity and guarantee the solidity of the enterprise if his has not been done sooner it is because every advance in social improvement must come in its season it is the ripeness of the occasion and the voice of the times that now speak it has been remarked that among the lands nows open for sale and settlement there are some tracks particularly in the illionois territory where the irish emigrant with the instruments to which his hands are accustomed and in a climate congenial to his habits might procure to himself immediate shelter and subsistence—and in a few years be able to repay with gratitude the benefits conferred on him we whose names are undersigned have met to consult upon the means of promoting some establishment that might be a rallying point for the distressed and give to the wanderer a habitation and a home we have thought of no better way than to address by this circular the friends and well wishers of ireland who cooperation might give most weight to the measure and to submit whether it might not be advisable to join all our efforts and petition congress early in the ensuing session for a grant of a suitable track upon a credit of or years subject to such conditions and modifications as the government may see most fitting to the government we would offer no deceptive delusive or precarious motive rather chusing to make its wisdom benignity and patriotism the anchor of our hope we request of our if you approve of our sentiment and of our project to advance and promote it by your best endeavours either by forming organized associations or by obtaining individual signatures to a petition to the effect stated we have not yet been able to digest a plan and have rather chosen to make this humble beginning in hopes that we should soon receive additional light upon the subject from correspondence we solicit we shall nevertheless proceed to investigate the subject and challenge the cooperation of good and respectable men and request of you to do the same you will please address your answers and any future correspondence to mr james moffit no frankfort street new york thomas addit emmet denis m'carthy william sampson john r skiddy james r mullaney john meyher william james m'neven cornelius heeny matthew carroll robert swanton james moffit new york nov mr emmet then stated that he had been requested by the gentlemen who called this meeting to explain the objects for which it was convenued that it could not be necessary to expatiate before those he was now addressin on the situation of the peasantry and farmers in ireland it was at present one of unqualified misetry partly occasioned by their local oppressions and partly by the general calamities of europe it compelled them to fly to these shores in such numbers and under the pressure of so great poverty that the most active individual benevolevence could neither provide them with a sufficient present succour nor procure for them within a reasonable time the means of permanent settlement the consequence was that many of those unfortunate strangers were totally lost to this county or forced by want to become noxious and dangerous to its cities whose original dispositions and qualifications if rightly directed and employed would have made them valuable and useful members of the community besides the accounts transmitted back to ireland of their disappointments and destitute situations deferred many who were suffering at home the extreme of wretchedness from endeavouring to better their condition in this more fortunate and favoured land—to the political institutions of which they were also more strongly attached a very painful reflection on these circumstances had suggested to come gentlemen then present the hope that the general government might be induced by a strong and united application to grant a portion of its unsettled lands on terms liberal and bountiful so that an asylum might be formed for industrious and enterprising farmers who would gladly fly from famine and persecution to a spot where the sweat of their brows falling on a fertile soil would yield them a rich harvest for their own exclusive benefit and where they might peacefully enjoy all the blessings of that republication liberty they loved the time for making such an application seemed auspicious party asperities had softened fown and probably few would now be led by political prejudices to give it opposition neither was it unprecedented a favour nearly similar had been granted to the french emigrants and to settlers from switzerland it is true we could not forth a pretence like the cultivation of the vine or the olive and we would not succeed by practising any delusion we could offer nothing but an immediate accession of industrious and hardy settlers who in a congenial soil and climate would become enthusiastically attached to the country and the government from whence they derived all their blessings and wherever they were found would form a barrier against every enemy much might undoubtedly be expected from the generous sympathy which the sorrows and sufferings of ireland had everywhere excited in the united states and from the acknowledged liberality of its constituted authorities but very forcible arguments might also be addressed to its policy and interest not only those that in the ordinary course of events would arrive here whose usefulness is lost by the want of proper direction and who become burdens or scourges to our cities would be rescued and placed in a situation where all the energies of active and enterprising minds would be serviceable to themselves and the community but also the very fact that such an asylum was open and accessible would infinitely increase the amount of emigration from ireland and people our wildernesses with incalculable rapidity the place upon which we have fixed our eyes is in the illinois territory—it has been lately purchased and is not yet even surveyed in the ordinary course of events it is not likely to be brought into market at least to any extent for many years but if congress listen to our application and grant to the settlers an extended credit government will receive payment for the land probably as soon as if it were suffered to remain unheeded till its regular turn for sale came round a large body of settlers will be enabled to grow rich during the time that the land would otherwise be waste and unproductive and the value of all the contiguous property belonging to the united states would be rapidly and immensely increased to say nothing of the advantages resulting from the strength of such a settled frontier all these considerations may be strongly urged by men who can most truly say they are actuated by no views of personal speculation or emolument who are willing to enter into all the labour of procuring settlers and organising the establishment without any prospect of gain or even compensation except as to what may be necessary for defraying the expences of the undertaking and who are desirous that the actual settlers should enjoy all the advantages which government may be willing to grant these are our views—we conceive that they may be realized if supported by an united and active cooperation of those who think like us in other parts of the union we are therefore desirous of adopting and pointing out to others what seems to be the best mode of giving system to that cooperation namely the formation of societies totally divested of all party or political feelings and directing the attention only to this object there are already a sufficient number of political institutions in every state in which the zealous partizan be his opinions what they may can act on them to their fullest extent let these societies be neutral groun or rather consecrated places in which when we meet we lay aside all our hostilities and join as brothers in our prayers and offerings at the shrine of our common worship they are consecrated to every man amongst us by the purity of their object by our earliest recollections by our unbroken affection and our strongest sympathies—by the unextinguished love of our native land for which most of us have already renounced all sectarian antipathies and religious animosities which we offer as a solemn pledge to the country of our adoption that our hearts will be always alive from temperament as well as principle to the emotions of patriotism and that those amongst us who have pledged their faith to her however they may seem to differ on some minor political subjects will always be found firmly ranged and united under the same banners and forming one phalanx whenever her more important interests are concerned mr emmet then moved four resolutions which being severally put were carried with some slight amendments as follow — resolved—that it is expedient to form a society of irishmen and descendents of irishmen for the purpose of endeavouring to procure from congress a track of land in the illinois territory to be settled by emigrants from ireland resolved—that every person of the foregoing description who shall on or before the second day of december next pay to the secretary of this meeting the sum of five dollars shall be entitled to become a member of the said society until the number of subscribers shall have amounted to one hundred after which time the subscribers shall be at liberty to elect their own officers and no person shall afterwards be admitted except by ballot resolved—that it be recommended in irishmen and the descendents of irishmen in the other cities and towns of the union to form similar societies for the purpose of corresponding and cooperating with that which is about to be formed in this city resolved—that as the meeting of congress will shortly take place and in order to prevent the less of time a committee of fifteen be appointed to prepare the outlines of a memorial to that body to be submitted to the consideration of the society when formed and organized and also to adopt such measures as they may think expedient for promoting and accelebrating the organization of that society mr john w mulligan in seconding mr emmet's motion expressed in handsome terms how much he was gratified by the invitation to attend had given him the opportunity of claiming his title of descendent of an irishman a committee was then appointed pursuant to the fourth resolution the number being upon motion and discussion augmented to twentyone committee—andrew morris thomas addis emmet william sampson john w mulligan thomas kirk james moffit robert swanton matthew carroll william james m'neven captain

being then opened a number of those present subscribed their names and paid five dollars as their initiation fee and became members of the association those persons who wish to become original members may do so by signing their names and paying their subscription to the secretary before d december pursuant to the second resolution after the meeting was adjourned the committee organized itself and appointed subcommittees to report a draft of a constitution and a memorial to congress and for the discharge of other requisite duties canada extract of a letter from a mercantile house in nova scotia to their correspondents in this quarter we sincerely hope that the duties government had in contemplation last year to impose upon timber imported into great britain and ireland from the british north american provinces equal to the additional duty imposed on foreign timber in will be further suspended our[] commercial system chiefly depends upon the encouragement of the timber branch ships that carry away that article[] bring us [] at a low freight whereby we are enabled to furnish the british west india islands with an abundant supply of fish[] and that on very moderate terms but in the event of government persisting in imposing the duty on timber from hence that branch of our trade will inevitably revert to the americans besides being the ruin of many in this and in the neighbouring provinces the supposed revenue that would accrue to the mother country upon trial will be found delusive to prove this many obvious[] reasons can be adduced as the trade now exists all the timber extracted from these colonies to great britain and ireland is paid for in british manufactures the export of so bulky an article as timber and the import of so ponderous an article as [] employs[] an immense number of british ships objects certainly of more real value to the revenue of britain than any benefit they could possibly derive from direct duties imposed on the export of timber from british north america it cannot be denied that previous to when the additional duty was laid on foreign timber they the foreigners were not only the carriers but would not accept an ounce of british manufacture in payment for their timber—no nothing but you gold[] which was so much in demand that s was given for a [] another very cogent reason [] be advanced in favour of what is commonly

derived the merchants in that line[] as well as the shipmasters were not only alarmed but convinced themselves ruined the baltic is shut[] what shall we do for timber and with our ships they properly concluded that perhaps the british provinces could supply them they made the experiment they were not disappointed—but succeeded far beyond their expectations if therefore in time of war britain has took to her colonies for a supply of such a necessary article as wood it is not reasonable for us to conclude that their interests will not be wholly neglected when blessed with peace extract of a

resolutions adopted in the province of niagara where some discontent has been manifested the first part is as follows— to his royal highness george prince of wales regent of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland &c the humble address of the inhabitants of upper canada may it please your royal highness the subjects of your royal father dwelling in upper canada should need no words to give assurance of their loyalty if the whole truth had reached the throne of their sovereign his subjects have reason to believe that the truth has not been told during three years of war upper canada was exposed to the ravages of a powerful and inveterate foe the government of the united states had been long concerting the invasion of this province hostile preparations against it had been long masked under other designs and at last the accumulated torrent of violence burst on the defencless children of the british empire nor were they assailed by the weapons of war alone an invidious proclamation preceded those host of the enemy forgetful of honour regardless of humanity and daring to seduce the subjects of britain from their true allegiance the subjects of britain remained dauntless and firm it was not for their property that they rose against their invaders the invader would have spared to them their property they flew to arms in defence of the rights and sovereignty of britain twice has the american standard been planted in upper canada while yet but a handful of british troops aided the native battalions wave the laurel of victory over the protrate intruders on their soil the second year of war saw canada contending with yet little assistance from the parent state the second year of the war saw her sons confirmed in their virtue and still more determined to resist wives and children had fled from their homes the face of the country was laid waste and the fire of revenge was sent forth to consummate distress and misery still was the spirit of the people unextinguished still did it burn with patriotism and loyalty by the third year every risk of conquest was at an end for now the british aid poured into the provinces and peace was proclaimed when war was no longer to be feared it is now more than three years since there was an end of war but strange to say these years of peace have manifested no appearance of affection or care from the mother country to the canadas commercial treaties have been made altogether neglectful of british interests here government transactions which used to give spirit to trade and are at a stand troops are withdrawn fortifications are suffered to go to ruin and rumours are abroad too shocking to be repeated in the royal ear may it please your royal highness to listen calmly to the complains and grievances of the people of upper canada who are fully assured that your royal highness has been kept ignorant of most important truths who are well assured of the generous disposition of your royal heart and of your desire that british subjects should every where share equally you paternal regard an affection it was a matter of much provocation to the people of the province to see even during the war which afforded such striking proofs of their loyalty and valour reports went home highly rating the merits of regular troops while the tribute due to canadian levies were unfairly set down may the principles of the most loyal subjects here were often stigmatised by british officers ignorant of human character and still more so of circumstances which affect it in this part of the world it was not so with the immortal brock he justly appreciated canadian worth and his memory will happily long cherish in the minds of the canadian people a due regard for the genuine spirit of a british solider at once generous and brave the loyal inhabitants of upper canada would disdain to notice the misrepresentations of individuals so contrary to notorious truth if these had not obviously conspired with other causes to lessen the regard which should subsist between british subjects here and at home to influence the conduct of ministers towards the general interests of the province the loyal subjects of his majesty in upper canada suffered grievously during the war in their property and many were bereft of their all a solemn investigation on this subject took place the claims of the sufferers were authenticated and there was every reason to expect that recompence would immediately follow yet nothing has followed but delay and insult surely if there is among mankind a single principle of justice that is one that the individuals of a nation ought not partially to bear the weight of public calamity surely individuals who have exposed their lives for government should not be disgusted with finding government regardless of those very principles which it is intended to sustain the people of this province are well aware that their fellow subjects at home are pressed hard with taxations and far it is from their wish that relief should be afford from thence canada contains within itself ample means of exonerating government from the claims of sufferers by war and it is within the fiat[] of your royal highness to remove by a signle breath the evil now justly complained of millions of acres of fertile lands lie here at the disposal of your royal highness upon the credit of which under proper management not only the fair claims of loyal sufferers could be instantly advanced but vast sums could be raised for the improvement of the provinces and the increase of revenue to britain another grievance manifesting the neglect of government to the concerns of upper canada is equally notorious and must be still more abhorrent to the general feelings of your royal highness the young men of this province who were armed in its defence had for their spirited conduct the promise of their commanders that land would be granted them as a reward for their services as soon as war was terminated and after this promise was universaly confided in the parliament of upper canada passed an extraordinary law in the face of established british principles that militia should pass beyond the frontier with these promises and in obedience to this law the militia passed beyond the frontier with alacrity yet since the peace the greater part of them had been denied the pledge of their extraordinary services and the land is unjudtly withheld the petition further states that such ingratitude such dishonour such errors in policy could not exist without extraordinary influences and it recommends most important changes equally for the glory of the throne and benefit of the subject it says that the scandalous abuses came some years ago to such a pitch of monstrous ingratitude the the home ministers wisely imposed restriction on the land council of upper canada it seems however that all this was insufficient and that confusion on confusion has grown out of this unhappy system upper canada it is now said pines in comparative decay and that discontent and poverty are experienced in a land supremely blessed with the gifts of nature it is insisted that the immediate interference of his royal highness might do much to remove the evils which spring from the system of patronage and favouritism and it asserts that the interposition of the british parliament is more imperiously required it concludes as follows— deeply penetrated with these sentiments and most seriously inclined to have changes speedily effected the loyal subjects of great britain dwelling in upper canada now take the extraordinary step of sending home commissioners to bear this to the throne and humbly intreat your royal highness to give ear to the details which it will be in their power to relate above all that your royal highness would immediately send out to this province a commission consisting of discreet and wise men men of business and talent who shall be above every influence here and who may be instructed to make inquiry into all the sources of evil american papers from the trenton federalist june the seizure trial and execution of two men said to be british

title of a convention at york when they came to the following resolutions richard beasely esq in the chair — resolved— that whilst this convention holds it one one of the most sacred right of british subjects at all times directly to petition the throne of their sovereign relative to their grievances yet nevertheless under the present peculiar existing circumstances of this country the members of this convention as well out of respect to that honourable body the commons house of assembly of upper canada as for other causes deem it their indispensable duty on this important occasion to recommend in the strongest terms to their fellow subjects resident in this province a spirit formal and respectful application to that honourable house for an inquiry into the state of the province that john clarke cyrus sumner and roderick drake esqs be a permanent committee for the management of the affairs of the convention and that they as soon as may be practicable prepare a respectful petition praying for inquiring and expressive of grievances for the sanction of this convention to be by them circulated for subscribers and presented at the bar of the house of assembly at their next

proposed plan of sending deputies to england with a petition to his royal highness the prince regent confining itself to an application to the house of assembly for an inquiry into the state of the province and a petition to his royal highness to be presented to sir peregrine maitland for transmission—from the quebec gazette of july our paper of thursday last contained a general view of some of the most popular publications on the subject of emigration and we shall now endeavour briefly to make an estimate of the good and evil which is likely to befall those who embark in this hazardous adventure there is one important fact which we gather from all the accounts of america whether written for the purpose of praise or censure namely that there is a great demand for labour and that wages are high and this effect is necessarily produced y the vast space of fertile and unoccupied territory which lies westward of the united states towards the pacific ocean it is this vacant territory which is the true spring of this american community here is the grand outlet for the superflouous population both of the eastern states of america and of europe to cultivate this waste there is a constant demand for new labourers wages are of course high — the labourer lives in comfort and if he is industrious he becomes in his turn a purchaser of land from the savings which he accumulates if labour should become more plentiful and wages should fall this is the signal for new emigrations and thus this constant demand for labour in the western districts regulates its general price throughout the united states in these circumstrances it is clear that a labourer provided he can reach this advantageous market for his labour will unquestionably improve his condition but herein lies the difficulty a labourer has seldom the means of of subsistence so far beforehand as to enable him to undertake so long a journey and if he enters upon the enterprise with insufficient means he is liable to starve before he can transport himself to his ultimate destination or he is forced to contract for immediate subsistence obligations little short of servitude under the weight of which he is grievously oppressed these then form strong objections to emigrations in the case of those who are stinted to their means but where these objections can be surmounted those who can transport their labour from the overstocked market of europe to the understocked market of america will unquestionably dispose of it to better advantage but if they have not the means they may as furely fail in the attempt and draw upon themselves aggravated misery and want as to the consequences of emigration to this country we hold them rather to be beneficial than otherwise and we cannot easily account for the very absurd alarm which has been propagated on this subject the evil in europe is that every country is overcrowded with labourers who cannot find employment and is it not manifest therefore that the withdrawing of some of these will make more room for the labourers that remain — that the loss of those useless hands will rather be a relief to the body politic and will diffuse greater soundness and vigour through all its parts that these effects will follow from emigration in this or in any other country in europe we cannot doubt — and that the labourer if he can afford the expence of the journey will receive higher wages in america than in this country is equally clear there is another class of adventurers who may possibly improve their circumstances by emigration although this is not so certain namely farmers with a moderate capital an allotment of land may be purchased in the back parts of america at the government price of two dollars per acre and an emigrant who can afford to but and to cultivate or acres and acts with proper judgement and skill may undoubtedly by a speculation of this sort be sure of a subsistence while by the continued emigrations from the eastern states the country being quickly settled all around him his property is daily improving in value but a want of judgement in the purchase or a want of ability to cultivate the land after it is purchased may involve him in irrecoverable distress and ruin and to avoid these hazards no little discrimination and prudence is necessary such are some of the most striking advantages of emigration and we shall now state some of its disadvantages the first and chief of these is the difficulty of effecting a settlement and of subsisting until the land which is purchased yields its first produce the country is partly open ground or prairie as it is called or it is covered with almost boundless forests a settlement in the woods requires incredible labour to clear it — labour is dear and not easily procured and this herculean task naturally devolves on the head of the family who is forced during the day to ply the axe in this laborious drudgery of felling trees and afterwards to follow the chace for a meal to his family here he must frequently sleep out in the woods and his body exhausted with his day's labour is exposed to the cold dews of night under such unintermitted toil his health declines and it is obvious that his family deprived even for a single day of his exertions must be reduced to the most deplorable straits in many parts the country which is marked out for emigrants is extremely unhealthy in particular the banks of all the navigable rivers which afford the most eligible settlements both in point of fertility and situation are exposed to the most fatal maladies the same causes which produce fertility produce disease the overflowing of the waters from the autumnal and spring floods fertilise the land in a most wonderful degree but the exhalations of these stagnant waters under a burning sun are as fatal to the health as the deposits which they leave are favourable to the soil hence the many minute directions which are given to all emigrants in regard to their health in a letter contained in the emigrant's guide we have the following advice to those who are descending the ohio if the weather becomes warm guard well against the smell of bilge water but if you must descend in the spring go early — avoid all delay and remember you are fleeing for your lives i have seen the havoc and i believed it not till then again it is observed let nothing tempt you to fish in warm weather immediately on changing your climate the effluvia of the shores is poison to a european emigran the climate must be of course even more fatal and he either therefore lose his health or he must be continually tormented with anxiously taking care of it which makes it a question whether it is worth having on such terms such are the hardships through which if he has strength to endure them he at length emerges into ease and independence these hardships however will no doubt be in a great measure avoided or at least mitigated if he has beforehand provided the means of subsistence until he can derive regular supplies from his own land in this case he is less liable to be dislodged from his situation by the casualties to which all emigrants are necessarily exposed —he is secured against the hardships of a first settlement and is more certain of attaining the wished for object of ease and affluence —to a farmer therefore or a labourer emigration presents a fair chance of a permanent settlement provided it is gone about with ordinary caution and the necessary degree of energy be exerted to insure success but it is a gross delusion to imagine that an elysium is to be found in the united states or that mankind exist there on any more favourable terms than in this country and those who set out on any such visionary schemes are sure to meet with a woeful disappointment with regard to other classes of society it does not appear that they will improve their condition by emigration to america there is no demand for clerks or professional men of any sort and no merchant has any thing to expect by removing his capital to the united states in the back settlements there is a demand for schoolmasters to teach the ordinary branches of education and several emigrants of this class have met with good encouragement in regard to the essential article of comfort it is apparent from all the best information on the subject that a person long resident in this country would change for the worse by an emigration to the united states he would in the first place suffer extremely from the climate from the extreme cold of winter and the raging heat of summer the thermometer frequently standing at degrees in the share with a clear sky and broiling sun and very little abatement of this exsessive heat being experienced through the night his frame accustomed to the more temperate though unsettled climate of this country runs the risk of being debilitated by the change and at all events he must suffer extremely in his enjoyments and in his spirit from this cause nor we should imagine would the manners of the people in the back parts be found very agreeable or polished it is admitted on all hands both by those who are favourable and those who are unfavourable to the americans that if there is not as in europe gross ignorance and debasement on the one hand neither is there on the other any thing much exalted above the ordinary level but the inferences which arise from this established fact are strongly in favour of europe the grossness of vice and ignorance carries a sure antidote to its corruptions in the disgust which it excites such examples are not so potent to debase as examples of a different sort are to purify and exalt there is little risk that society will be contaminated by what is low and debased but on the other hand there is a certainty that what is exalted and illustrious in literature science taste accomplishments or fashion will exercise a powerful influence on the general state of manners we naturally copy what we admire and those great and shining examples constitute a standard to which the whole system of life and manners has a tacit reference in the united states they have no such models — they do not aim at so high a standard and taste and manners are therefore necessarily at a lower ebb than in europe —hence all accounts agree in reprobating the extreme filthy habits which universally prevail and cobbett who will be suspected of too great partiality to this country draws a contrast between the inhabitants of hampshire and those of the united states in which he places this vice of the american manners in strong colours and he adds as his reason for this that they have no gentlemen's seats with the fine improvements of pleasure grounds &c dispersed through the country as models of taste and neatness for the inferior classes and it is to the same principles that we may trace other defects in their manners namely that they have no proper models on which to form themselves hence excepting in the principal cities we may safely conclude from all the information we have received on the subject that society has not reach the same degree of refinement as in this country an emigrant accustomed to live in britain would also feel the disavantages of american society strong in this that here in so closely peopled a community surrounded with all sorts of refinements life is assisted by such a variety of helps that it glides down the smooth stream of comfort and convenience without ever meeting with a single interruption it is astonishing to what a pitch of improvement a society is brough abounding in wealth and in all the mechanical arts and where the ingenuity of thousands is incessantly on the rack to set on foot new devices for the common good we are not duly sensible of the advantages of this because like other advantages they are familiar to us by long habit and we begin to imagine that they are inherent in the natural constitution of things but when we are suddenly transplanted into a new community abounding indeed in subsistence but deficient in all comforts — where only the coarsest mechanic arts are practised — where the inhabitants are so widely dispersed that their common exertions cannot be made available for the common good we find life interrupted at every turn in our former society if we had not the previous secret of transmuting all things into gold we had at least the power of transmuting gold into every thing else but here the power of money is limited we must indeed pay for services but we must also beg for them and thus we go on fretting and tormenting ourselves under petty incommodities which in this country would be remedied as soon as they were felt it is inconceivable how much inconvenience and discomfort and real unhappiness may spring from this cause in this country by long habit and pracrice and continual improvement every thing has fallen into its right place — each individual has a separate task assigned him in the joint task of labouring for the general benefit — and the industry of all however variously directed tends to one common end there is a perfect unity of effort we all labour in common — we combine our efforts that they may yield the largest possible produce and this produce is accurately shared among the various members of the community each receiving the share to which his labour entitles him such is substantially the process by which commerce diffuses the benefits of industry over every civilized community —money is the instrument by which this division is effected every one who labours has the value of his labour ascertained in money which is a draft upon the common stock for whatever quantity of necessaries and luxuries he is entitled to and all these complicated operations are executed with a regularity almost mechanical but in a community newly forming there is a want of unity and combination — all the members labour indeed but no one has his proper part assigned him — there is a jostling and an interference with each other — and when they come to divide some have too much and some too little of certain articles — the stock is ill assorted and money will not execute its functions hence disorder arises and inconvience and awkward wants and an individual suddenly removed into this region of discomfort from the happier climate of a highly improved community must be annoyed with feeling in the highest degree gloomy and disagreeable he must have the same sensation as a person who quits an elegant mansion fitted up with every comfort and convenience for one of inferior quality and coarsely finished where he is exposed to a thousand annoyances every minute it is observed by dr johnson that the evil of life does not consist in any sudden and overwhelming crash of misery but in a series of petty discomforts amd mischiefs continually preying upon the temper the truth of this maxim those who emigrate from this country to the back woods of america will have a good opportunity of verifying the prevalence of slavery in most of the states of the union constitutes another capital defect in the structure of american society these slaves form a degraded and oppressed class and in the tyranny exercised over them they themselves are morally destroyed while the corruption extends to the other orders of society equally infecting the oppressed and the oppressor and debasing the general character and habits of the people it is vain to talk of liberty while stain of tyranny so deeply infects the domestic manners of a community there can be no rational liberty unless we call that liberty which gives us the privilege of torturing and oppressing our fellow creatures to give an idea of the consequences of this dreadful evil of slavery we may state that it is a practice in kentucky to commit delinquent slaves into the hands of the public executioner by whom they are unmercifully flogged at the markey cross of the different towns the streets being filled with their pietous cries what can we think of the people where such spectacles are for a moment tolerated this is so utterly revolting to every just and enlightened feeling that to a european it would form a strong objection to his permanent residence in that country in all the northern states and in some of the new states particularly that of the ohio slavery is indeed abolished but in several others the black form a large proportion of the population and they are not decreasing we know indeed that this evil is admitted in its full extent by all the american statesmen that they lament it but do not well see what measures can be adopted to check it the importation of new slaves is indeed prohibited but the increase of those already in the country is the great grievance against which it is difficult to devise a remedy and the cruel and oppressive treatment which slaves will always meet with wherever they exist must tend to degrade the habits and moral feelings of the community at large to such therefore as are accustomed to european society where no such strain of tyranny infects the domestic manners an exchange into a community where his feelings may be revolted by spectacles of gross cruelty cannot be regarded as very desirable if more imperious considerations permit they have certainly a greater chance for happiness by remaining where the rights of nature are respected than by removing to a society where every principle of humanity is trampled upon to the editor of the edinburgh weekly journal sir—it will be remember by many of your readers that in the spring of proclamations were widely circulated inviting settlers to canada—having myself occasion to visit this country i was curious to know what had been the result especially as i found at quebec and montreal very discordant accounts respecting it most people asserting that the scheme had failed of success and that the settlers were in a state of great discomfort and discontent—to ascertain the truth i diverged from my route about miles and spent some days at perth situated on the waters of the redeau to which a considerable body of the people who accepted the invitation of the government had been conducted—here it traced the reported discontent to some neglect in the general management and some ill conceieved petty regulations capriciously exercised towards people tenacious of their rights but in the main universal satisfaction prevailed among the settlers and a strong feeling of the good intentions of government towards them the opportunity being a good one of ascertaining the progress which a promiscious body of settlers make in a given time i constructed the annexed table and had each man's signature attached at once to prove to correctness of his statement and satisfaction with his situation should you think this worthy of publication you are welcome to publish it in your paper it may draw attention of a most important subject—the colonization of this province with british subjects and it may afford satisfaction to many individuals who may not otherwise know the condition of their friends the scheme which government adopted in was expensive the settlers had a free passage rations and tools next year rations and tools were furnished to those who came out and this year multitudes of poor people have come to canada in expectation of being favoured in the same way but are disappointed having nothing given them but land acres each which many of them from poverty are unable to occupy having made it my study during three months residence here to inquire into the nature of the country and into every particular respecting settlement i am convinced that very simple measures might be adopted by which the redundant population of britain could be conveyed by a regular flow into canada instead of being wasted as it now is to the great prejudice of british interest over the whole of american and were such measures adopted this province would in a very few years be quite equal to its defence in war against the united states —i am sir yours &c upper canada september robert gourlay statistical table of the scotch

their place of punishment the number on board that ship on leaving sheerness was between to many of whom were diseased and infirm their condition has been rendered most intolerable from an unaccountable delay that has taken place the ship tottenham had not proceeded farther than the downs when she lost her rudder by some accident or other she returned to sheerness where she now lies and where she is likely to lie for some time upon the pretence that the loss she has sustained is a justification for delay however protracted the unfortunate inmates have been led to expect that some important mitigation of their sentence has taken place —so that between the suspense and the terrible species of confinement to which they are subject their sufferings are hardto be described—observer the hon lieutcolonel erskine—it is with the greatest concern we have to mentioned the death of lieutcolonel erskine lord erskine's youngest son on his passage to ceylon he served throughout the campaigns in spain as a captain of light infantry in the st regiment and behaved with great gallantry in the battle of the pyrenees where being shot in the thigh he was sent home by the medical board and on his recovery was placed by the duke of york on the staff of the army in the adjutantgeneral's department when the duke of wellington took the command in flanders he was in the battle of the th of june and afterwards on the th at the battle of waterloo where his station placed him in the dangerous position of being attendant on the duke around whom almost every officer was either killed or wounded amongst the rest this brave young man had his left arm carried off by a cannonball which passing along the other laid bare the whole of it by which he lost the use of two of his fingers but that arm was saved when the cannonshot had thrown him from his horse and as he lay bleeding upon the groun in this mangled condition the prussian musketry and trumpets being heard at a distance he seized his hat with his remaining shattered arm and waving it round him cheered his companions in the midst of the dying and the dead the duke of wellington being then close by him who desired he might carried to his tent it must be some consolation to his afflicted family that he must have distinguished himself in the opinion of his great commander as he was immediately recommended by him for the rank of major though a very young officer and in a year afterwards to the rank of lieutenantcolonel with the appointment of adjutantgeneral in ceylon and if he had then fortunately sailed for india his life might probably have been saved but his disposition being as affectionate as it was animated he could not be persuaded to leave mrs erskine who was pregnant and remaining here during the winter the cough with consumptive symptoms arising from his wound laid too deep a hold on him to derive benefit from the voyage and he died on his passage to india colonel erskine was only years of age and has left three sons and a daughter and an infant a few months old the marriage of the duke of clarence with the rich heiress miss wykeham is said to be finally arranged and from what we observe it is not likely to suffer any delay from the late domestic calamity it is said that the prince regent has given his own personal assent but whether it has passed through the constitutional forms and that the royal assent in council has been given we do not pretend to know it must have that sanction to secure the lady the right for herself and heirs of succeeding to the throne on this interesting subject it cannot be forgotten that king in council refused his assent in three former instances the refusal of the princess royal of denmark arrived in town on monday or tuesday last week on wednesday it was communicated to his royal highness the duke of clarence and on thursday he set off to brighton offered his hand to miss wykeham and was a thriving wooer colonel henry fitzclarence the son of the duke of clarence lately deceased was a young man of uncommon energy of character and of talents and acquirements in the affair of the th light dragoons he displayed a spirit of independence and manliness the most honourable he was an admirable linguist and as we understand was about to return to england with the view of being employed in the diplomacy for which he was peculiarly qualified colonial intelligence death of the duke of richmond by the henry arrived in the rive from quebec we have advices from thence of the th september three days later than the last accounts they confirm we regret to say the intelligence received at lloyd's on friday of the death of the duke of richmond at montreal where he had arrived on his return from inspecting the new settlements in upper canada his body had been brought from montreal to quebec where it was lying in state at the time the henry sailed his daughter lady mary lennox continued in the most afflicting state and great fears were entertained for her recovery lady sarah lennoc his grace's second daughter is married to majorgeneral sir peregrine maitland they accompanied his grace to north america and have remained there since he entered upon his government his grace was the lineal descendant of the first duke of richmond natural son of king charles ii by a french lady who was created by his majesty duchess of portsmouth and by louis the fourteenth duchess of aubigny in france his titles were duke of richmond early of march english honours duke of aubigny french honour duke of lennox early of darnley and baron methuen of torbulton scots honours the title of aubigny was confirmed in march by louis xviii by causing the estate of aubigny to be assigned to him and granting him the honours of the louvre as enjoyed by his grace's ancestors he was a lieutenantgeneral in the army colonel of the th regiment of foot gonervor of plymouth governor of upper and lower canada and their dependencies lord lieutenant of the county of sussex and high steward of chichester —his grace was born in succeeded his uncle charles the late duke in and married in charlotte daughter of duke of gordon by whom he had issue seven sons and seven daughters all of them now living except his third son henry adam r n who fell overboard the blake as she was sailing into port mahon in and was drowned his grace was distinguished early in life by a duel with his royal highness the duke of york he was of an open candid generous temper and of plain and unaffected manners qualities which were particularly conspicuous in ireland when viceroy of that country his grace is succeeded in the peerage his eldest son charles earl of march now duke of richmond this young nobleman in the army has seen much active service under the personal auspices of the illustrious wellington being one of his grace's aidesdecamp and was one of the representatives in parliament for the city of chichester which seat of course becomes vacant he was lately married to the eldest daughter of the marquis of anglesea and has issue a son now earl of march the following is extracted from the quebec papers quebec thursday sept this province has again been visited by one of those afflicting dispensations of providence which by separating by the hand of death the ruler from the people covers whole communities with mourning an express arrived here yesterday morning from montreal with the afflicting intelligence chief that his grace the duke of richmond governor in chief of these provinces had died on his way from kingston to montreal at the moment that he was hourly expected to join his family there from which he had separated in good health at kingston one the th to complete by visiting the new settlements the long and arduous journey in which he has been engaged this melancholy and utterly unexpected intelligence spread with the greatest rapidity and impressed a deep gloom throughout the city the flag on the citadel and on all the vessels in the port was hoisted halfmast exhibiting every where the signals of public mourning his grace's body immediately after his death was conveyed to montreal it reached this city last evening in the steamboat malsham and was removed this forenoon to the castle with the usual military honours and followed by his grace's staff the principal civil and military officers in the city and garrison and a great concourse of mourning inhabitants september his grace's remains were conveyed from montreal to quebec in a steamboat at ten o'clock one the morning of the d of sept they were removed from the vessel and placed upon a hearse upon the king's wharf at quebec from whence it was conveyed to the chateau of st louis where they lay in state until four o'clock on saturday the th september when they were removed to the place of internment in the cathedral church at quebec on the corpse being brought out the collar and insignia of the order of the garter with his grace's military and other appointments being placed on the coffin the whole of the troops presented arms on its being placed on the hearse the troops rested on their arms reversed the procession then moved forward it was composed of all the principals persons attached to the public military and civil departments the military band filed off at the door of the cathedral churchyard and conducted it up the centre aisle when it was played on a platform the mourners remaining by the body a signal was then given when the body was deposited — guns being fired extract of a letter dated quebec sept — when i wrote the first side i did not expect so soon to communicate the melancholy event of the death of our governor the duke of richmond who was attacked on his route from upper canada with symptoms of hydrophobia which terminated his mortal career at six miles from the settlement of richmond he was perfectly sensible of his situation and gave himself up from the first spasm which attacked it was occasioned by a bite of a tame fox at sorel on his way to upper canada about three months since his death at this juncture is looked on as very unfortuante for this country as he possessed the entire confidence of government and was about completing a plan of defence for the canadas which when executed would establish a water communication with our extreme points perfectly free from interruption in case of a war with the states we are happy to learn further that no part of his grace's family was so dangerously ill as was at first reported they are only in that situation which might be expected from so severe an affliction colonel wilson had succeeded the late duke of richmond as governorgeneral of both canadas being the senior officer on that station sir charles saxton and major m'leod aidesdecamp to his grace the duke of richmond have gone to lake winnipeg clothed with special powers to investigate the causes of the unhappy

evident that a laudable spirit of enterprise has been awakened in that important country the committee who in the execution of their functions travelled through the greater part of lower canada conclude their report by putting on record a testimony they justly conceive to be honourable to the character of the inhabitants of the country through which they passed although many hundreds of persons from all parts of their respective counties attended the agricultural meetings which were frequently of four or five hours duration there did not occur at any of them a single instance of intoxication disorderly conduct or personal altercation the grand jury at nassau new providence have brought in a bill against sir gregor m'gregor charging him with aiding and abetting piracy by issuing commissions in the bahamas to subjects of power in unity[] with spain a letter from sierra leone dated the th of march says— it is with the deepest regret i inform you that notwithstanding the liberality of great britain and the faith of treaties the coasts swarms with slave vessels dragging thousnads of its miserable inhabitants into endless captivity a few days ago arrived here the union of liverpool the supercargo states that during his stay in the river calabia not less than eight vessels averaging slaves each had sailed for the spanish colonies we have received gibraltar chronicles to the th ult from which we learn that in consequence of the rapid increase of the fever at the isle de leon his excellency governor don had issued a proclamation on the d ult announcing that all communications with spain except through the customary process of quatine would close at sunset on the following evening notice was also given to such of the labouring classes as had not passed the fever that they would be provided with tents and encamped on the neutral ground for their better security against infection should it unhappily appears in the fortress they would not be suffered to proceed to town and follow their callings during the day but heir return to the encampment at night was peremptorily enjoined we are happy to learn however by the latest advices from the british fortress that the garrison and inhabitants were not at all infected with the disease in answer to the remarks which appeared in our paper on monday last respecting emigration to america and to the statements there given of the disadvantages which emigrants from this country might expect to meet with we have received a very abusive letter from an anonymous correspondent who appears very angry and like most other angry men seems more anxious to give full vent to his wrath than to assign any good reason for it his first cause of quarrel is that we have stated the general want of cleanliness to be a prevailing defect in the back parts of the united states for this we have the authority of almost every traveller who has visited those parts the remarks of birkbeck on this point are conclusive and striking — ' in viewing the americans he observes and ' sketching in a rude manner as i pass along ' their striking characteristics i have seen a de' formity so general that i cannot help esteem' ing it national though i know it admits of ve' ry many individual exceptions i have written ' it and then erased it wishing to pass it by ' but it wont do — it is the truth and to the truth ' i must adhere cleanliness in houses and too ' often in person is neglected to a degree which ' is very revolting to an englishman ' america was bred in a cabin this is not a ' reproach — for the origin is most honourable ' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn ' logs for a framed building and that again for ' a mansion of brick some of her cabin habits ' have been unconsciously retained many have ' already been quitted and one by one they will ' all be cleared away as i am told they are now ' in the cities of the eastern states ' there are i believe courthouses which ' are also made us of as places of worship in ' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating ' ever since they were built what reverence ' can be felt for the majesty of religion or of ' the laws in such styles of abomination the ' people who are content to assemble in them ' can scarcely respect each other here is a bad ' public example it is said that to clean those ' places is the office of no one but why is no ' person appointed might it not be inferred ' that a disregard to the decencies of life prevails ' through such a community' to the same purpose cobbett complains of the ' general for there are many exceptions sloven' liness about the homsteads and particularly ' about the dwellings of labourers mr birkbeck ' complains of this and indeed what a contrast ' with the homesteads and cottages which he left ' behind him near the exemplary spot guild' ford in surrey' he then proceeds to give the reasons for this when the first settlers took possession of the country the ' example of neat' ness he observes was wanting there were ' no gentlemn's gardens kept as clean as ' drawingrooms with grass as even as a car' pet from endeavouring to imitate perfec' tion men arrive at mediocrity and those who ' never have seen or heard of perfection in these ' matters will naturally be slovens' he afterwards remarks — ' the market day at guildford is a perfect ' show of cleanliness not even a carter without ' even a clean smockfrock and closely shaven ' and clean washed face well may mr birkbeck ' who came from this very spot think the people ' dirty in the western country i'll engage he ' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one ' family of his present neighbours than he left ' behind upon the skins of all the people in ' the three parishes of guildford however he ' would not have found this to be the case in ' pennsylvania and especially in those parts where ' the quakers abound and i am told that in ' the new england states the people are as ' cleanly and as neat as they are in england ' the sweetest flowers when they become pu' trid stink the most and a nasty woman is the ' nastiest thing in nature' in answer to all this our correspondent tells us that the scotch are very dirty this we admit was formerly and may still continue in some degree to be the reproach of the scotch but does this reasonable person mean to argue from this that dirty habits are amiable and ought not to be corrected with regard to the difficulties of effecting a settlement we are borne out in our remarks on this subject by the authority of various writers and principally by the autheor of the emigrant's guide a work of great merit which combines an extent and precision of statistical information altogether unequally with the most enlarged general views of the state of the country both physical and moral ' most men observes ' this judicious writer on arriving in the united ' states expects too much perhaps the only ' essential advantages offered are the security of ' person and property and the cheapness of land ' it demands excessive labour severe economy ' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident to ' succeed in a newly settled country and it de' mands the permanency of this continued la' bour prudence and favourable circumstances' our anonymous correspondent is also extremely displeased that we have stated so strongly the perincious effects produced on the general manners of the americans by the existence of slavery and he mentions that many a labourer in this country might envy the condition of an american slave what are those privileges for which a free man should envy a slave he does not think proper to state to show however that we have not exaggerated the degradation and oppression of the coloured class in the united states we shall again adduce the authority of the emigrant's guide the author is contradicting the notion that the labourer in the slave states is confounded with the negroe and he expresses himself in the following terms — ' a residence of years in places where sla' very is prevalent enables us to contradict a ' general expression that in such places whites ' performing manual labour are confounded in ' the moral estimates of the people with slaves ' though less respect is certainly paid to useful ' labour in the slave states than where all the ' duties are performed by whites yet ' the distance between the two races of men are ' in all cases immense so deep profound and ' inveterate is the feeling on that subject that ' not any where in the united states can pro' perty sobriety intelligence and every other ' advantage expect colour raise in public opi' nion a man the most remotely allied to the ' african to a rank equal to the meanest white ' any person who resides a few years in louisi' ana will be witness to some very remarkable ' exemplifications of this innate contempt for all ' those who affinity involve them in the con' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery' what a picture is here conveyed of misery and degradation on the one hand and of tyranny on the other — here we find it failry confessed that no degree of worth whether moral or intellectual not even the possession of property can give a man the least degree of consideration in the eyes of the privileged class we cannot conceive a community more wretchedly constituted all that is estimable and worthy is here utterly contemned because the individual who possesses these qualities happens to have his skin of a particular colour and thus a merely accidental quality of the corporeal frame entails upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy and contempt these distinctions carried to such an excess seem to us to be founded on the extinction of every generous and honourable sentiment and we cannot help still asserting that we had rather live we at present are than in a community where such hateful antipathies rule to the exclusion of every just and humane feeling with regard to the condition of the negroe slaves we shall quote a passage from brown's western gazetteer or emigrant's directory after reading which we shall leave our anonymous correspondent to say whether he thinks the condition of a labourer in this country preferable to that of being an african slave the writer describing the town of lexington in kentucky observes — ' in this square stands the markethouse ' which is of brick and well furnished on wed' nesdays and saturdays but occasionally the ' scene of a barbarous practise for it is here ' that incorrigible or delinquent negroes are ' flogged unmercifully i saw this punishment ' inflicted on two of these wretches their ' screams soon collected a numerous crowd i ' could not help saying to myself these cries ' are the knell of kentucky libery' having made this answer to the angry charges thus brought against us we have only to disclaim in the strongest terms all hostility or prejudice against the americans we have no wish either to depreciate their character or institutions they exhibit the interesting spectacle of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace to wealth and greatness to revile such a people would be the height of human folly and equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to take offence because endeavour to make a fair estimate of their character without hiding any of its defects colonial intelligence york uc nov lord selkirk vs north west company on friday the th of october the court of oyer and terminer proceeded to try the gentlemen accused as necessaries to the murder of robert semple esq and others at red river on the th of june and the trial was rendered extremely interesting by the disclousure which took place of many extraordinary circumstances connected with the hudson's bya and north west companies which for some time past has excited so much of the public attention in this province the gentlemen tried on this occasion were messrs alexander mackenzie hugh m'gillis simon fraser john macdonald and john m'laughlin } accused as accessories after the fact and mr john severlight accused as an accessory before and after the fact it appeared in evidence that the north west company had been upwards of thirty years in possession of trading posts called forts at different points on the red river in the indian territories and it is well known that for a century before the north west company the canadian for traders had been in the constant practise of resorting to that country which was visited for the first time by traders of the hudson's bay company about twentyfive years ago it was put in evidence that for many years afterwards both companies carried on their trade to red river without interference in each others pursuits and without any disturbance in the country and it was explained that the principal object of the trade being to collect provisions enlisting chiefly of the dried flesh of the buffalo which abound in the plains and the country producing abundance for the supply of both parties the same causes of dissention did not exist as at trading stations where the fine furs are obtained in small quantities and where rival traders would at all times be likely to dispute about the divisions of them the red river country therefore remained quiet and undisturbed until the arrival of the earl of selkirk's colonists and servants and the attempts made by their leaders to prevent the usual supplies of provisions from being obtained by the traders the proclamation of miles macdonnell the soidisant governor of ossinibour prohibiting the exportation of provisions from red river was the first document produced for the defence at the recent trials it was proved that under this assumed authority several acts of violence were committed by mr macdonnell and his followers trading posts and buildings were forcibly entered depots of provisions seized the river the only outlet from the country blockaded by batteries mounted with cannon and the trade of the north west company wholly interdicted before any acts of retaliation were attempted on their part and even before they took any precautions for their own defence or for ensuring the safety of their provisions on which depended the existence of their trade and the lives of their people mutual and continual acts of aggression and retaliation appeared to have exasperated the minds of both parties and to have rendered them so suspicious of the designs of each other as to be always on their guard and prepared for defence in short it appeared in evidence that the country remained in a state of private war which at length ended in the battle of the loch of jane the particulars of this unfortunate affray were fully investigated in the trial of bouche and brown for murder as principals the statements on both sides are already before the public and the acquittal of the prisoners shows sufficiently that the jury considered mr semple and his party to have been the assailants on the trial of the alleged accessories the cirumstances which led to the meeting of the hostile parties were made out in the evidence to the following effect viz — in march mr colin robertson with an armed party acting under the orders of governor semple who had succeeded governor miles macdonnell at red river captured by surprise the north west trading post at the forks of the river called fort gibraltar and took possession of all the stores and provisions in the latter part of the following month of may governor semple caused the buildings which were of wood to be taken to pieces and the materials were floated fown the river in rafts to be used in constructing his new fort which he called fort douglas and where following the examples of his predecessors he mounted cannon to command the passage of the river built an armed schooner or gunboat to complete the blockage and effectually to intercept the provisions and trade of the north west company mr alexander macdonnell a partner of the north west company who had charge of their provisions at riviere qui appele one of the branches of the red river became alarmed at these measures of hostility and assembled as many people as he could half breeds and others for the protection of the property under his care with which at the usual time he proceeded down the river till he arrived within sixty miles of governor semple's fort he then landed his provisions made dispositions to defend them if attacked and sent a party of his people with a temporary supply to meet the canoes from below apprise them of the blockages and concert with them the means of eluding or removing it this party under the direction of cuthbert grant a half breed and a clerk of the n west company was ordered to land above fort douglas in order to keep out of the reach of the cannon and to carry these provisions in carts at as great a distance as possible from the fort so as to avoid being seen—this it was fully proved they did but a swamp in the rear of the fort compelled them to pass within about two miles of it and being deserted and pursued from then the conflict ensued in which mr semple and most of his party were killed it was further made out in evidence that in the spring of the year the agent of the north west company at montreal were still in need of more than the usual supply of provisions from the red river because there had not yet been time to replace the vessels on the lakes and the other means of transport which the americans had destroyed during the war nor to replenish their stores at fort william with the usual quantity of provisions from canada having also heard of the seizure of one of their posts at red river in the fall of the year and apprehending further aggressions in the spring mr m'leod one of the agents with all the partners and clerks who could be spared from montreal proceeded up the country early in the spring and on arriving at fort william received intelligence of the capture of fort gibraltar and the blockade of red river towards which place he immediately proceeded with as many of the partners clerks and servants of the company as he could collect by the way in order to rescue the intercepted provisions in the defence of which or in their own defence if fired on by semple's blockading battery it was their avowed purpose to use force if necessary but it was distinctly proved that their intentions and orders issued to their cannonmen were to pass fort douglas singing and to proceed up the river for their provisions without landing or molesting any one unless they should be attacked—they arrived at red river three days after the battle and mr m'leod who was a magistrate being of opinion that mr semple's party had been the assailants and that the half breeds had only acted in self defence did not adopt any measures against them the half breeds but on the contrary expressed approbation for their having defended their provisions and gave them the supplies of clothing &c usually given to all the servants of the north west company while at the same time he arrest some of the survivors of mr semple's party and served subpoenas upon others to give evidence of these transactions in the courts of lower canada this was the whole of the evidence and the only circumstances which appeared relative to the prisoners were that mr sevewright the alleged accessory before the fact was with mr alexander macdonnell when he sent off grant and his party to escort the provisions past fort douglas and that the alleged accessaries after the fact arrived at red river with mr m'leod after the battle was over and appeared to consider it as it is now found to have been an affray in which the unsuccessful party were to blame and in which the successful party were not murderers—the judge who presided at the trial declared in his charge to the jury that there was not a scintilla of evidence against any one of these gentlemen and the jury accordinagly returned a verdict of not guilty it will be recollected that these gentlemen were arrested by the earl of selkirk at fort william in aug on the charges of high treason and conspiracy as well as murder—and that the buildings and property of the north west company at that place were forcibly seized and subsequently retained by an armed force under his lordship's command the north west company represented at the time that these accusations were merely a pretext set up to palliate the preconcerted plunder of their property and destruction of their trade while on the part of lord selkirk it was alleged that the crimes committed by the partners of the north west company were so atrocious as to justify his lordship's proceedings against them and for some time the public opinion remained in suspense as to the real merits of the case so far as regarded the seizure of property and the interruption of trade the point was decided by the prince regent's proclamation of the rd of may in consequence of which the north west company recovered possession of their property and reestablished their trade but that proclamation left the rights of parties and the crimes alleged against the individuals to be investigated and decided upon by the law — and until such investigation could take place much uncertainty necessarily prevailed from the contradictory statements and affidavits which had been laid before the public the recent trials at york however decided the point as to the alleged murders and the charge of high treason has never been followed up nor ever mentioned since it served the desired purpose by figuring in lord selkirk's warrant as a pretext for seizing and examining the books and private papers of of the north west company reform in upper canada it has been already mentioned that governor maitland on opening the session of the legislature of upper canada recommended that measures should be taken to prevent the meeting of delegates for obtaining reform in upper canada accounts from quebec and montreal dated the end of november state that in pursuance of this recommendation the legislature on one of the first days of its meeting appointed a committee to inquire into the subject who almost instantly came to the following resolution resolved that it is the opinion of this committee that some such legislative provision should be enacted as the wisdom of the imperial parliament has found it proper to provide to meet similar occasions to put it out of the power of any designing persons to organize discontent the proceeding appears to have raised the indignation of the gourlay or reforming party in upper canada as will be seen by the following extract — montreal november this legislative provision it will be immediately perceived is the suspension of the habeas corpus act for that was the course pursued in england we do not believe that there is the most remote necessity for such a measure we do not hesitate to say that the members have not spoken the sentiments of heir constituents in their echo of sir p maitland's speech with the most humiliating servility and we feel convinced that it will not be borne with by the people while they have the control in any way of their representatives the sentiment therein attempted to be disseminated is an libel on the truly loyal people of upper canada it would sound in our ears like the knell of their liberty if we were not persuaded that its adoption would provoke a spirit of resistance not corporal but mental not secret and illegal but open and legitimate which if the administration do not take

prominent — the engaging and armind a number of disbanded soldiers foreigners the entry of them by force of arms into fort william in august retaining possession of the fort till may sending off as prisoners the partners of the north west company found there getting rid of the clerks by subpoenas to appear at york at a period when no courts are held there without ever inquiring whether they know anything of the matters to which the subpoenas related and without ever bringing them forward afterwards stopping of the outfits from going into the interior and the returns from coming into montreal possessing themselves of all the books and papers of the concern sending away the principal clerk under a charge of felony without examination and without having ever followed up the charge the pretended sale by daniel mackenzie of the north west property obtained by his lordship by means of continued duress tampering with and debauching the north west company's servants and commanding them

october and granted by the magistrate ordering the restoration of fort william to the north west company he was also the bearer of a warrant for felony issued against his lordship dr allen captain matthey and others upon an information upon oath before a justice of the peace mr smith got to fort william on the th of march and produced his writ of restitution with which his lordship refused to comply and when the earl and others were arrested by mr smith upon the warrant for felony his lordship laid hold of him and pushed him out of doors and he was afterwards kept in close custody in the fort under a military guard a circumstance which added much to the grievous nature of the offence and which was particularly dwelt upon by the judge in his charge to the jury was that whilst mr smith was kept in a rigorous confinement charles de reinhard though under an accusation of was at large and keeping a school though nominally under the surveillance of one or two of his former comrades the chief justice also remarked upon another part of the evidence for the defence by which it appeared that the only option left to mr smith to obtain his liberty was that of abandoning his duty and breaking his oath of office by a promise not to molest lord selkirk mr smith however notwithstanding this proposal persisted in doing his duty and was not liberated until the evacuation of fort

engineering—who has been residing in this city for two or three years but whose utility was considerably arrested by an unfortunate habit to which he had become addicted—was destined on that day to breathe his last—in a moment of intemperance as he stood by the piece of artillery which was firing the evening salute he exclaimed that he wished to die as the second gun was about to fire and immediately after the commanding had given the word fire conolonel tatham presented himself in front of the muzzle of the piece and by its discharge his abdomen was almost literally blown to pieces his body was raised a few feet in the air by the explosion and he fell upon his face without uttering one word that was heard by the byestanders—colonel tatham died without any family circumstances had strip life of much of its attractions in his eyes but it is impossible not to regard the manner of his death with horroer and to feel the deepest commiseraton for his melancholy fate he was a man

followed by a most numerous assemblage of croppers clothdressers and other artisans and labourers out of employment they kep coming in at an early hour in the forenoon from wortley armley holbeck and all the neighbouring towns and villages and it is computed that at one time there were full three thousand of these distressed people assembled chiefly in briggate as many of them marched into the town with great sticks in their hands they created some little alarm but their conduct was uniformly peaceable their complaints were not loud though they might be deep the worthy mayor and magistrates with the whole of the civil power were in readiness to act as circumstances might require but fortunately there was not the slightest occasion for their interference by far the greater number of the assemblage dispersed by noon and returned to their respective homes several respectable gentlemen went among them to ascertain the motives of their thus assembling and from every inquiry it does not appear that they have the least disposition to commit any breath of the peace but in fact the people know not what to do in their present state of distress i understand that an active subscription is going to enable a number of these poor men to proceed to canada and others are said to have expressed their wish to be sent to botany bay provided they can obtain the sanction of government the case

by the late earl of f who died at berlin to a foreigner who was one of his domestic servants the payment of the legacy is disputed by the heiratlaw of the late earl on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consideration and from its novelty the case is of course the subject of much conversation in the northern metropolis the arguments and pleadings in this extraordinary suit in which the most eminent counsel of the edinburgh bar are engaged display much classical as well as legal learning but no judgement has yet been pronounced by the court from the magnitude of the sum in

manner —he was porter to the prosecutors and was frequently about the shop a large house dog having seen him take money from the till which he tied in his pocket handkerchief followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a shed near the stables and then he came into the shop and appeared quite restless pulling every person by the skirt[] and apparently wishing them to follow him at length henry heydon the apprentice having occasion to go to the stable the dog followed him and having drawn his attention to the heap of rubbish under which the money was buried began to scratch at it till he brought the booty to view the apprentice brought it to his master who counted and found it to contain s in copper coin after marking it he desired the boy to place it in the same spot which he did and soon afterwards finding that it was removed he asked the prisoner some questions about it but he declared his ignorance of the whole transaction reeve the marshalman was then sent for who on searching the prisoner found some of the marked ballpence[] in his pocket—remanded bank committee—the opposition journals last wek asserted that the rank restriction committee of the house of commons intend to report in favour of mr ricardo's plan of paying in specie that is the bank shall pay next january in gold bars at the present price of gold l s per ounce any quanitity of notes not being less than sixty or a hundred pounds' worth and that in two years afterwards they shall pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold l s per ounce mr ricardo's plan goes farther it recommends that the bank shall never pay in coin but in bars of gold at the standard price in short that the bank shall at all times buy gold when offered at l s and sell it when demanded at l s d if the opposition journals be correct in stating that the restriction committee intend to report in favour of payments in bullion at the market price and should parliament adopt that plan then there will be a very great saving to the nation in the expense of coinage the waste of &c all the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in foreign commerce will be answered as well by payments in gold bars as by payments in coins and the danger of a domestic run on the bank for gold coin in a moment of panic as in will be completely prevented this is indeed at all times the only danger to which it is exposed a run for coin on the country banks would instantly fall on the bank of england and would cramp if not dry upthe currency throughout the empire producing the greatest confusion now if the opposition journals be correct the currency will be placed in perfect security at perfect ease nothing will be able to disorder it if persons will hoard specie they must purchase gold bars or foreign coin or content themselves with silver in the year and we imported corn only to the amount of l each year and then the value of gold was rather below the standard price in the year we imported to the amount of six millions and in the year we imported to the amount of eleven million sterling during the last two years the price of gold rose should we have an abundant harvest or two and little importation of corn become necessary gold will again fall very low the bank will then be able to pay to buy gold to the full extent of mr ricardo's plan and to place their notes on a firm unquestionable foundation the finances of the continent and of the world indeed—the sources and circulation of money will during peace gradually become steadier and better known the east indies at present drain away an extraordinary quantity of specie while spanish america in consequence of her troubles yields far less than usual it would be madness to fly in the face of all these circumstances by compelling the bank to pay in gold coin perhaps it may be desirable to limit the issue of bank notes to some certain yet liberal amount we pretend not to anticipate the report of the committee but if some rumours be true we augur favourably of it it[] is said mr tierney divided the committee and stood alone in voting against the report thus then the report cannot be in favour of a very sudden or decided plan for the resumpion of cash payments or mr tierney would not have voted against it and yet it must hold out a reasonable prospect of a rational scheme for that resumption or the other

the disorder was such it baffled all medical aid the alarming symptoms were such that business was nearly suspended—the white population seeking safety in other islands or in the remote and healthiest

yorkshire nottinghamshire lancashire wiltshire hampshire and somersetshire and in fact from almost all parts of the heavilytaxed island we have left behind us our ship was detained near a week in the river about miles below new orleans we all went on shore and had plenty of rabbit shooting i killed the most with my doublebarrelled gun by knock corner of fetterlane henry myself and mr blake went one day into the woods to kill deer by night coming on we lost our road and differing in opinions we separated henry and mr blake taking one road and myself the other i reached the ship about five miles at ten o'clock but they remained lost all night in the woods and did not return to us till the next morning it being wet and henry sleeping on the marshy ground in spite of the remonstrances of mr blake caught a severe cold and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days but he is now perfectly recovered he is grown fat in the river there are thousands of wild swans wild geese wild ducks woodcocks snipes and other wild fowl if you were there you would kill a waggon load in a day as i know you have frequently killed a horse load in england but they are a thousand times more numerous here than i ever saw them in england this market swarms with them and very cheap no game certificate required here myself henry mr blake and the other passengers visited a french farmer about six miles below new orleans he has got acres of his own land whereon are sugar plantations sugarhouses & c he made hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year he offers five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter as a fortune on her marriage there are plenty of french settlements on the banks of the mississippi but they are the most slovenly and the worst farmers i ever saw —they are very lazy bad managers and appear to use their negroes very cruel and work them very hard the europeans generally leave new orleans in the summer as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the deaths are frequently seventy in a week the scenery of this country is very picturesque it is very much like the banks of the river thames about richmond and staines and many of the buildings are as handsome as those of bath here is one church which is a very beautiful building on sunday the french and spanish shops are all open and it is a market during the whole day balls and the theatre open in the evening gambling & c we are at the washington hotel the best in the city it is expensive although very good living here we pay ten dollars aweek each including claret and rum and water there is no beer here in warm weather as in england and it is as warm here now as it was in england in july although not half so oppressive and stinking as it was in covent garden during the election persons dine and sleep in this hotel most of them english we do not trouble ourselves about politics in this country our object is to cultivate the soil and to reap the fair reward of our labour on saturday we were charged dollars each for passage and four dollars six cents for every hundred weight we have three and a half tons weight with us do pray send me four quarters of the best peas rye grass seed and some more of hill's scots ploughs to be left at messrs brown and co who will forward them carefully to me at the illinois mr trimmer an englishman has purchased acres of land near mr birkbeck and has taken twenty couple of hounds with him so that we shall have some hunting as well as shooting if we like it is said that he is about to marry one of mr b's daughters he is now here he tells me that there are plenty of english farmers settled all over the illinois territory he is here to get labourers they are the only thing wanting there i should have brought over some with me but they may follow us as i understand the labourers with the pay of a dollar a day can live better than a hampshire or wiltshire renting farmer of l or l a year mr riply and others that i have seen from illinois report that the farmer can get a sure profit the first year mr ripley says there is a good sure market and a fair profit and only one penny per acre land tax this is all the taxes we shall have to pay price of labour is very dear here we pay a dollar for washing every dozen of shirts cravats pocket handkerchiefs & c & c the price of a gallon of best rum is one and a half dollar the customhouse duty on my things shipped from england i have paid dollars for although i should like england very well if it was not for the taxes yet from what i have seen hitherto i like america ten times better emigration to america important extracts of a letter from a very intelligent and respectable engineer in louisville dated january the best time for coming to america i should judge to be in the summer to land in september so as to be able to get here before the weather was too cold it is safe to settle in the beginning of winter or spring so as to inure to the climate by degrees the best plan for coming is to take a part of the steerage of a vessel and find your own provisions you will save more in this way over a cabin passage than would buy a decent farm here the lands in this neighbourhood raise a crop of wheat and one of corn alternately and improve dung is never applied and is said to be hurtful it is without question what the land here is as good as can be and when to this is added the heat of the summer one ought to be able to raise crops as heavy as they will stand you wonder at dollars being enough to clear an acre it is not cleared all the trees under inches are cut down and burned on the ground and the large ones are killed by cutting round the bark the ground is then prepared for indian corn by scratching it with a hoe or a kind of shuffle which from the looseness and mellowness of the soil is easily done and in this way sixty or eighty bushels an acre are sometimes raised —the trees die in a few months and in three or four years fall down one by one and the roots will rot out in seven or eight years it is a great want of sense in any new settler not to adopt the modes of this country proven to be the best adapted to the state of it by years experience the americans of all other people i know of are the most ingenious in adapting the means to the end i do not know if they have more sense than other nations but they certainly make it go farther every tools answers the purpose most effectually this is evident in their axes an american will cut down three times more trees and square three times more timber than the best of your wrights could do and not by more strength but by fitter tools so it is with cutting their grain a man will cut down four acres of wheat in a day what what he calls a cradle scythe and lay it as refular for binding as reapers can do sixty bushels of indian corn is the average of kentucky but bushels of wheat is about the average of an acre it is easier farming here than with you on sundry accounts the soil is free few weeds make their appearance and when ploughed down are certainly killed by the hot sun there are no frosts to injure the crop and no wet weather to destroy it when cut hay is made in two days and grain is cut one day and stacked or housed the next from the shortness and mildness of the winter little provender is needed for the stock swine are raised at no expence they breed and feed in the woods and only want from one to three bushels of corn to fatten for killing when they sell for five cents a lb in the less settled parts of the country it is the practise to give all the corn to swine and then send them to market a bushel of corn is equal in nutriment to a bushel of wheat for man or beast the brig henry sailed from cork on wednesday se'ennight with about two hundred passengers for aux cayes to join sir gregor m'gregor who lately landed on the spanish main with a small force general m'gregor it seems left authority with colonel eyre to recruit men for his service and to ship them as he best could —there are a number of idle gentlemen about dublin at present and also many in the country who have been captivated with the speculation of embarking in the patriotic cause and for some time they have appeared in the streets in fanciful uniforms we understand that col eyre has formed a committee who treat with such young gentlemen as have the inclination to proceed on the enterprise and have money to pay for such rank as they may wish to possess under m'gregor the money thus furnished is made a stock purse to pay the freight of the vessel and hence it is necessary that the greater part of the adventurers should be officers for those who are contented with the humble station of privates are not required to contribute and their passage subsistence &c must be defrayed by the common fund mr d'evereaux from the county of wexford is also raising men for the same service but under different circumstances he professes to have authority from general bolivar to grant commissions and to ship the men he may raise for headquarters in venezuela mr d'evereaux has not yet dispatched any men and col eyre has certainly shewn more activity in this respect —dublin journal colonial intelligence advices have been received again from the cape of good hope of th march which are several days later than those acquired formerly of the rising of the caffres there remains no

short time that it was in possession of this country various important improvements were introduced into its domestic administration the practise of torture according to the humane and enlightened maxims of british jurisprudence was abolished new and better modes of collecting the revenue were adopted and a spirit of mildness and of regard for the interests of all the various classes of which the population is composed was evinced which made the british government highly popular considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants for the safety of the queen charlotte jamaica packet she

arrived at kingston from cork and the nd west india regiment was about to embark for sierra leone to be disbanded emigration the increased population of this country as well as the great difficult to which the middling classes of society are exposed in their efforts to procure the ordinary means of sustenance has given rise to the formation of little copartnerships or joint stock companies of individuals who being unable to command capital enough singly to encounter the expences of a new settlement have put their little funds together with a determination to sail for america and there jointly to labour for the general good of the whole until fortune shall so far favour their efforts as to enable them to become independent of each other by this means much less than the hundred pounds stipulated by mr birkbeck as the proper stock for an emigrant to begin with will be sufficient and thus a new impetus will be given to that tide of huma beings which is constantly flowing towards the new world would it not be policy to give encouragement to these industrious swarms to settle in our own colonies we have heard with some pleasure in rumour that several parishes have taken into their serious consideration the prudence of establishing a fund for the encouragement of those poor persons who may be dispoed to seek a means of occupation in canada in furtherance of which laudable design an application is to be made to government for grants of land in desirable siutations especially in upper canada where the climate is described to be of the finest description there is no doubt that many who are now pining in workhouses would gladly accept of such an alternative and who instead of being as at present a burthen to themselves and to society would by their exertions be adding to the importance and stability of our possessions in that quarter as well as opening a new source for the consumption of our manufactures letter from mr morris birkbeck english prairie illinoia nov sir— your favour of th june is before me presuming you retain a copy of the queries i proceed to answer then in order — respecting domestic servants what may be the condition of our colony in two years it is impossible to foresee but should it be in your power to bring with you female domestics it would be well to do so also a carpenter or two and a few labourers if with families so much the better written engagements for a term or indentures are not binding unless renewed on this side of the atlantic i have not seen any of these documents and can therefore give you no precise directions for them perhaps a simple engagement from the parties acknowledging as a debt the expence incurred in bringing our might be a sufficient security leaving their wages to be determined here according to the current rates yet to be established by the proportion of supply to the demand which as i remarked above it is now impossible to ascertain as to the number of labourers or female domestics you would need perhaps six of the former and two of the latter would a safe adventure looking to the colony for an addition should you need it after you are settled — before that you will find a greater number an incumbrance this is i think all i can say to your first third fourth and fifth queries all expence of transfer of your family and luggage supposing the latter to weigh ten thousand pounds i should estimate under l sterling on this particular subject mr r flower would give you most particular information —the luggage would cost about ten dollars per lbs so much for your query to the seventh query — i think l would assist your family in plenty for a year exclusive of wages and clothing eighth query — l would be a good capital for a section or acres and i question your wishing to hold in cultivation a larger tract ninth query — i consider our situation not liable to future disturbance from indians in the event of a war between great britain and the united states being covered by increasing settlements to the west northwest and north tenth query — the earthquakes mentioned by bradbury i have heard of from many persons but i have not discovered that it has left any impression on the public mind on this score for my own part i feel no anxiety about the matter great britain i suppose in proportion to its dimensions is equally liable to earthquakes elenventh query — the route by new orleans will i have no doubt be preferable to that by the eastern cities when due precaution against the diseases of the climate are observed i have never failed to recommend it twelfth query — the health of my family has not suffered from the climate one of my sons has been affected with ague this summer has been more sickly in these parts than any season for seven years

settlers to which i have so anxiously invited the attention of the readers of my journal on the whole provided common sense should be seconded by common industry in the inclosure and cultivation of our colony i think we shall not be visisted by more than our due share of physical calamity i deferred noticing your second query the subject being connected with the proposal respecting land at the conclusion of your letter i would strongly recommend your deferring the purchase of land until your arrival it would be difficult to convey to you the reasons but you would feel the propriety of my advice should you come i think you would have as good a choice two years hence as now because excellent siutations as yet unsurveyed will then be on sale i have no eligible offer to make you beyond a section you inquire concerning venomous reptiles they are no source of injury or alarm to us insects in new countries often abound to an astonishing degree and are sufficiently teazing to man and beast many species yield instantly to cultivation and are heard of no more as plagues others will continue until conquered by order and industry the thermometer ranges from below zero to above the extremes are of course of rare occurence and short duration at philadelphia i understand it rose this summer and in this neighbourhood in the low river bottoms i believe it might reach that degree on

necessary for the convenience of the colony there are already three extensive settlements on the south east coast of africa where the finest wheat is produced with little labour namely algoa bay st catherine's bay and the new settlement on the knysua a considerable river which is navigable for large vessels to the northward there are also extensive and fertile lands towards saldanha bay as the produce from the new colonists will consist of grain and as the markets of the cape of good hope the isle of france brazils &c will in all probability be soon overstocked the settlers will look to the mother country for a market when an unfavourable harvest renders the import necessary and in anticipation of this event the merchants interested in the cape trade intend we understand to make an application to government respecting the corn laws to put the corn from the cape of good hope on the same footing as grain from the british north american colonies colonial intelligence the accounts received on tuesday from the cape of good hope are to the th april which are considerably later than those previously received information has just reached cape town that a detachment of troops joined by a number of the inhabitants who had been sent to suppress the caffres had succeeded in driving them back and were compelled to cross the river the corn districts were in a great measure cleared of the savages and the countrypeople were returning to their homes where they considered themselves secure from any further attacks at least for some time to come letters have just been received via calcutta from new south walves up to the end of november the colony was then all well and several convictships the marley glory mario isabella and others had arrived having made the passage out direct in the short period of three months and twenty days and landed all their convicts and passengers in good health this may be considered as another among many proofs that it is unnecessary to make any stay at any intermediate port extract of a letter from sierra leone dated january it is with the deepest regret i inform you that notwithstanding the liberality of great britain and the faith of treaties solemnly entered into this coast swarms with slave vessels drugging thousands of its miserable inhabitants into endless captivity a few days ago arrived here the union of liverpool the

canadians preparing to set out from this place the th inst for lord selkirk's settlement on the river rouge the number of settlers there at this time it is said amount to about an intelligent canadian in easy circumstances with whom we conversed and who goes thither with the beforementioned settlers with all his family says he passed a winter there when engaged in this for trade and reports it to be a fertile country and the climate much milder than that of canada thus there is every appearance that this colony in the course of time will become populous and flourishing intended colony at the

o'clock in the morning of the th of june and that from the inflammable nature of the house[] and more particularly of their roofs it spread with such rapidity that in the short space of three hours fa[] milies were burnt out besides an immense quantity of produce consumed in various stores and warehouses we learn from another account that the fire destroyed the whole of the old part of the town

even the slightest intention of interrupting either of the ships his lordship's squadron appeared in excellent order and it is but justice to his lordship to state that he has not resorted to any undue or improper means to man his ships but on the contrary in every instance of complaint made to him by the masters of merchant shipping of any of their crew having deserted to him he ordered the men to be again instantly sent on board their respective ships emigration to the cape of good hope from blackwood's edinburgh magazine the chancellor of the exchequer has submitted to parliament the expediency of voting t towards the encouragement of emigration to the cape of good hope let it be remembered once for all that it is not because that colony is too thin of inhabitants but that the mother country is too full that this plan is suggested the question is not how you maintain a surplus peasantry in the land that gave them birth but whether you will stop emigration to the frozen shores of canada and to the united states or divert and encourage it to the finest colony in the world —we surely have learnt enough of north america to convince us of the degraded and miserable conditions of its people south african on the other hand has every advantage to repay the sacrifice of quitting the land of our forefathers the more fully to understand and appreciate these advantages we shall set before our readers a short view of the conditions and facilities of the colony in question the spring from september to december is the most agreedable season the summer from december to march is often intensely hot the autumn from march to june is generally fine and pleasant the winter is rainy and stormy and for the most part so cold as to make fires very comfortable during the months of july august and september most of the diseases that appear among the natives proceed rather from their gross and indolent modes of living than the unheathliness of the climate the scarcity of water in summer is unfavourable to cultivation and for want of industry or materials this defect is not remedied as it is in india by artificial tanks or reservoirs whenever however irrigation can be employed either from wells or rivers the most abundant vegetation ensues good and abundant water has always been found by digging wells in cape town and the vicinity in the whole colony there is scarcely a river that can be called navigable though swollen into torrents during the winter most of them dry up during the summer all the rivers are well stocked with perch eels and small turtle and with a certain distance from the coast they abound with the several fish peculiar to these seas there is general want of wood in south africa —at the distance however of miles from algoa bay there is a large forest of a many thousand acres some of these trees taxus elongatus grow to the amazing size of feet in diameter and to the height of or feet of trunk clear of branches the wood is useful for many purposes but will not bear exposure to weather the ironwood grows to the size of feet in diameter and the trunk straight and very high —the hassayni wood is a beautiful tree the constantia wine is known throughout europe and to what perfection the other wines of the colony are capable of being brought may very fairly be augured for the great improvement that has already taken place in its manufacture heretofore the dutch farmer and the merchant have regarded more the quantity than the quality of their wine and when a cargo was once shipped it mattered little to them whether sound or sour it reached its destination little care was taken in the growth of the vine the branches were permitted to rest upon the groun while decayed and unripe grapes stalks and leaves were all promiscuously thrown in the winepress the mode also of seasoning the casks with brimstone and the want of good brandy to fit it for foreign markets have all contributed to deteriorate the character and confine the sale of cape madeira these defects have lately been in a great measure remedied proper persons have been sent out from madeira and this country and every care seems now taken to meet and secure the growing demand in european markets the trifling duty affixed to cape madeira in this country has been the means of introducing it into many families which have hitherto used homemade wines and though the merchants at madeira have made many remonstrances on this preference it surely is but equitable that encouragement should be given to the stape export of a colony now decidely and we must trust unalterably english but in addition to wines there are other articles of colonial growth exported to the east indies europe and america grain wool bides and skins whale oil and bone dried fruits salt provisions soap and candles aloes tobacco such are the articles of commerce that might be turned to the best account —but neither trade nor prosperit of any kind will continue to thrive in this colony under the present mode of administering its government and laws it has been said that despotism would be the best of governments were the despot virtuous this may be but contituted as human nature is we fear that the purest amongst us needs some control control however there is none over the governor at the cape he makes and annuls laws at pleasure he inserts a proclamation in the cape gazette and from that moment his fiat becomes the law of the land he has indeed an adviser in the colonial secretary whose influence does not extend beyond that of mere advice strange to add the laws at the cape are at this moment dutch laws rescinded and obscured by all the edicts of the different governors of the colony all pleadings are in writing and were till laterly carried on foribus clausis in a court of appeal for criminal and civil cases was established over both of which the governor presides in india in the west indies and in canada there is a governor and a council these act as checks upon each other but at the cape there is no appeal beyond the governor the taxes however at the cape under which we groan so painfully in this country are comparatively trifling european luxuries very justly pay a heavy import duty but their purchase is matter of choice—this falls not upon the poor not consequently will it fall upon those most likely to emigrate under the provisions of the parliamentary grant noting indeed can be framed with greater care and precautions than the encouragement bedd out in mr vansittuart's proposal a small deposit l is to be made at the colonial office in downing street by each individual a free passage is to be granted and on reaching the cape this deposit is to be returned to the settler by the local government and such is the liberality that has guided the proposed plans it is moreover stipulated that if families should agree to emigrate and their minister with them not only permission will be granted them so to do but provision will be made for him the separation from country and from kindred is thus softened and it will allay many a sorrowing regret and painful recollection that in distant lands and amongst a strange people the settler may still listen to the voice and instruction of a pastor to whom custom veneration and affection have all united to attach him it appears that the experiment of a settlement of english has already been made upon a limited plan at saldanha bay the finest harbour in south africa and with such success as to give the best encouragement to a more extensive emigration indeed from what we have outselves seen of the colony and its great facilities we have no doubt whatever of the benefits that must arise to the sober steady exertions of the industrious at the cape or elsewhere poverty and misery will attend the vicious and indolent but certain we are that there is no country under heaven where the poor may find a safer asylum and where activity economy and good conduct will meet with so certain and full a reward during the stay of the rd regiment of foot a scotch regiment at the cape many of the privates were known to save the whole of their pay and were thus enabled to return to england with a very hand some little fortune english servants of all descriptions are in great request and sterling a month are no uncommon wages for a tolerable cook it is nevertheless to beremember that clothes of all kinds are expensive at the cape as no manufactory is permitted lest it should injure the trade of this country still farmers in the country dress very coarsely and cheaply and their wives and daughters except on sunday are humbly clad as themselves indeed in so soft a climate as the cape there is that occasion for multiplicity and warmth of apparel which colder regions require for threefourths of the year the best bed is a hard mattress with a single coverlet there is point which we cannot pass over as we think it very intimately connected with the virtue and happiness of the settlers and that is the education of their children nothing is more neglected than this in southern africa the boors farmers are ignorant to a degree passing credence with the minister that is to accompany families it would be highly expedient to send a few sober intelligent men as schoolmasters attempts have been lately made to introduce into the colony the madras system of instruction and a free school upon that plan has been established at cape town with considerable success still the natives are stubbornly averse to instruction their luxurious and bountiful climate supplies them with all the necessaries of human life and beyond this they have neither wish nor ambition but if knowledge has its fruits ignorance has its weeds the savage and unparalleled cruelties that have heretofore been exercised towards their slaves and the hottentot servants by these dutch boors may very fairly be traced to want of education as a main cause the unjust limits shown by the dutch laws to the white man's barbarities have doubtless encouraged their perpetration —cruelty is not the character of englishmen and therefore too much care cannot be taken to guard the families of the new settlers against the contagion of the inhumanities that they must see practised around them and how far an early and thorough acquaintance with our duty to god and man will counteract this influence aided a knowledge of common school attainments we need not say the we have thrown these remarks together more as loose hints for the consideration of our readers than with any idea of furnishing a complete view of so wide and important a subject we may be induced hereafter to review the question more in detail the plan itself as confessed by the chanceller of the exchequer has at present assumed a very imperfect shape americe we have not seen and can only speak from the reports of other those reports are sufficiently discouraging on the contrary all who have seen and described the cape have united in praising it food is cheap and abundant the price of labour is exceedingly high trade is important and increasing many parts of the colony are beautiful and its climate is mild and healthy there are few countries upon earth where so many components of happiness will be found to concentrate emigration to the cape of good hope official circular the

who emigrated to america from within four miles of godalming in surrey two years back has been handed to us for insertion during the present rage for emigration we think we are justified in giving it insertion leaving it to those who are interested in its contents to draw their own con clusions we have reason to conclude that the letter is genuine and is not we believe as many have been which have found their way into the public press the produce of ingenuity on this side the atlantic — philadelphia july my dear sir — i have received your welcome letter together with the patterns you were kind enough to forward although our habits here are in many respects different from those on your side of the atlantic yet i assure there is a considerable degree of anxiety among our american belles for english fasions and the display which your prompt attention to my request has enabled me to make has procured me not alone a great influx of visitors but of business you ask me to give you my candid opinion of the policy of removing hither with your wife and family i can have no hesitation in complying with this request but at the same time i shrink from the responsibility of your being persuade from any things which i may say to follow my example it is impossible to disguise from myself and i would not attempt to disguise it from you that many who have come here anticipating prosperity and independence have failed but at the same time as far as my humble observation has enabled me to judge i am persuaded that many of those failures have been the result of unpardonable imprudence and the absence of that activity and spirit of perseverance by which persons depending on their own exertions can alone expect to succeed i have seen many individuals here reduced to very melancholy straits from having left their native shores thoughtlessly without more money than was sufficient to support them for a fortnight — this has been dissipated on their landing almost before they had recovered the effects of a long and fatiguing voyage and being thus reduced to extremity their spirits have failed and they have at once sunk into a state of apathy and listless despair those who have labouring and mechanic trades to follow and will sumbit to degradation as some of them call it of becoming journeymen do tolerably well with regards to myself i need not recall to your mind the species of drudgery to which i was forced to submit in order to support a decent appearance in london you often joked me on my enterprising disposition and doubted my resolution to come to this country in search of that independence which i foresaw i could never obtain at home here i am however and an hour since i had the pleasure of paying work women the lowest of whose weekly wages i those who take their work home is five dollars you will start at this and so will mrs b it is however no less true than extraordinary in short i have every reason to be grateful to providence for having given me the confidence to sufficient to try an experiment which has turned out so fortunately i have commenced both millinery and dressmaking to which i have added the childbed and ready made linen business and in every one of branches i am full of orders my most sanguine hopes have been realized my capital at the beginning was exactly sterling and a few of those articles of stock which were necessary to make a show these combined with the attractive titled of miss p— from london'&c in a few weeks set me afloat in a surprising manner i did my utmost to please my customers and in a few months moved from a situation of obscurity to one of the first respectability i am thus particular because i know you feel an interest in my fate my brother james who you know is a bricklayer and builder has been equally fortunate—he has had several contracts and is now building a row of twenty houses besides other jobs of a smaller description of the other fiften persons who accompanied us from godalmbing and its neighbourhood i am proud to say they have all been tolerably successful the greater part of them you know were farmers and they are now settled in farms of from fifty to five hundred acres from one hundred to one thousand miles from this place all these hoever came out with small capitals—but none with less than myself—and husbanding their resources and abstaining from extravagance of every description they finally successed in laying the foundation of their own future happiness we all have our own prejudices in favour of our old habits but this must wear off in the course of timeother there is a roughness and absence of what we call good manners about some of the americans not at all congenial to english taste they are for the most part however hospitable and if you let them have their way and do not thwart their humours are really very kind and disposed to friendly intercourse you talk to carrying your family to the western states—to the illinois country and of commencing farmer and storekeeping there it is probably that your views may be very correct but i think you may settle nearer to us if not at so cheap a rate at best with a greater certainty of present comfort of the western states i of course can know nothing but by report the emigration in that direction has been immense but the journey to some has been so long as frequently to produce repentance before the destined goal was reached we have had several english scotch and irish families here on the way to pittsburgh who i understand were bound for mr birkbeck's settlement but i have not heard of their arrival the greater part have gone down the ohio in arks which you say you have seen described in birkbeck's books no doubt these people must have to encounter great privations and perhaps some danger time and perseverance howeverwill overcome all difficulties and from the natural course of things in the end the great object in view plenty and independence must be attained and this as you very justly say is worth a struggle upon the whole if you can be content to give up all those luxuries of which an english fireside is the scene to abandon the habits of social intercourse to which an english neighbourhood give encouragement and to derive happiness from the consciousness of seeing yourself surrounded by an abundance of the necessaries of life alone you cannot fail of success i agree with you that a vast deal of the pleasure of england are counterbalanced by the castant visitation of the taxgathered from these at least you will be free here and as for society your own family large as it is must be a treasure in itself added to which in proportion as wealth increases civilisation must follow if you could get three or four families with whom you are acquainted to join in your plans and settle in your neighbourhood an additional assuance of success and happiness would be attained as to capital i think you ought to hav on your landing here l which with moderate exertions and common good fortune must afford yo uthe means of certain prosperity i shall however write again in september on this subject when i intend sending for my sister and perhaps the information i may be able to collect in the interim will confirm your plans and induce you to accompany her to this side of the water i rather think we shall shortly have another cargo from surrey i will let you know every particular in my next as well as send you a list of the things which it will be policy for you to bring with you your seven children instead of being a burden to you here will form one of the most prominent sources of your wealth emigration to canada about ten days ago an emigrant arrived from canada to paisley and brings very favourable intelligence from that country he is a native of scotland was some time in the army and is going home again as he calls it early in the spring this person gives the most satisfactory and cheering account of the place and says his chief complaint was the want of society to share in his felicities to be companion of his joys and to exult in his abundance he adds that one of his principal reasons for coming here at present was hearing of our distressed condition and that he might be able to persuade others to follow his example anxious to be surrounded by happy intelligent and social neighbours his arrival and narrations combined with other circumstances have been the subject of considerable discussion the whole of last week a strong desire for emigration has been manifested and about have already subscribed their names as a testimony of their ardour to go away a petition is immediately to be forwarded to his majesty's ministers imploring their assistance by way of loan or donation to enable them to carry their wishes into execution this petition it is said is to be supported by the principal gentlemen of the county and the utmost anxiety will doubtless prevail concerning its success —let us hope that government will see the necessity of attending to the supplications of these people the sheriff depute has been memorialized upon the subject to give his counsel and support in behalf of the measure and it is much to his honour that he has evinced a great disposition to favour the object in view his office has been appointed for the reception of signatures where the persons experience the greatest kindness in every possible way it is proper at the same time to mention that a number who were wishing to subscribe as desirous to emigrate have been rejected as their circumstances were not of that despairing nature as to warrant an interposition of this kind in their favour it cannot be expected that those who enjoy a considerable degree of comfort at home or who have sufficient means of their own to emigrate without public aid ought to be included among that number destined to participate in this salutary and benevolent proposition some of the fiercer radicals with their accustomed zeal and spleen are busily employed in jeering and deprecating the idea of emigration and telling the people to stay and help in the recovery of their rights they declare the whole scheme to be a mere farce intended to be played against them in order to destroy the unanimity which they say exists in the nation concerning their grand object these querulous politicians complain of the climate of canada and it must be granted that it resembles italy more than scotland being hotter in summer and coller in winter than our own island but the country is healthy the soil is fruitful and strong constitutions and longevity are as common there as in any other part of the globe the same manners language and regulations prevail in upper canada as in scotland and when people have plenty of provisions fuel and warm clothing to resist the effects of heavy snows and intense frosts the objection of cold is less worthy of consideration —glasgow chronicle dutch colonial law and negro fortitude from lavaysse's account of venezuela trinidad margaritta and tobago just published stedman after having given a picture of the cruelties practised on the negroes at surinam relates that on his arrival in that colony a white man was flagged by a black executioner for having stolen some money from the townhouse and he remarked that this negro inflicted the punishment with great signs of commiseration a negro was broken on the wheel for the same crime and he bore that horrible punishment without a sigh a moment afterwards they prepared to hang another and whilst the hangman was tying the cord round his neck to launch him into eternity he looked steadfastly with a smile of contempt at his judges who were among the spectators of the execution having expressed to the persons who were near me says captain stedman how much i was shocked with the injustice and cruelty of those executions and surprised at the intrepidity of the negroes during the punishment a very decent looking man thus addressed me sir you are newly arrived from europe but if you were better acquainted with negro slaves what you now see would neither excite your surprise nor your pity it is not long since i saw a negro suspended from that very gibbet by the ribs the following is the manner in which it was done two incisions were made in his side in which was passed an iron hook attached to a chain he lived three days suspended in that manner his head and feet hanging down licking from his bleeding breast the drops of water that fell on it for it rained at the time the sufferer did not however utter a groan and never once complained on the third day another negro was flogged under the gallows and having cried from pain the former reproached him for his want of courage are you a man said he to him you behave like a child —a moment afterwards the soldier who was sentry on the spot taking pity on him dashed out his brains with the butt end of his musquet i saw another negro quartered the narrator after his arms and legs were tied to four very strong horses an iron nail was driven under each nail of his hands and feet he suffered that without complaining requested a glass of ru and ordered the executioners to let loose the horses but that which amused us most continued this monster was the humour of the fellow who when the hangman presented the glass of rum to him that he had asked for told him to drink first as he was very much afraid of bepoisoned and desired him to take care that his horses should not kick him as for old negroes being broken on the wheel and young women burnt alive nothing is more common in this colony mr birkbeck's settlement a small pamphlet has lately been published consisting of letters and extracts of letters from mr birkbeck of which we have been procured a copy the author's object appears chiefly to have been to counteract the misrepresentations circulated on the subject of the settlement by cobbett we read cobbett's remarks when they were first transmitted to this country and certainly did not think them worthy of the notice here bestowed upon them his objections to the new settlement helped out as they were misquotation and misconstruction were of very little weight except in so far as they applied to all emigration whatever and they had really nothing to render them worth reading but the sarcasm and caustic humour which accompanied them we should therefore have been better pleased had mr birkbeck allowed this restless controversist to wallow in the mire of his own endless contradiction and rather given us some more details regarding the settlement the americans are every year pushing forward into the wilderness but it is a new thing for a body of our countrymen when withdrawing from a society richly provided with all the accomodations which wants of civilized life render necessary to pass through the settled and cultivated parts of the new world and to retire to the untrodden waste a thousand miles from the sea though the activity of commerce carries many of the convenienes and even luxuries of life to this remote place still the settlers must find such a difference in their situation as must subject them to go many privations and some details shewing how the colonists got over their difficulties how their various wants were supplied and how the feelings and habits of civilized life accommodated themselves to the woods and the wilderness would have been much more interesting than a reply to cobbett's captious objections one of the most trying privations of the colony seems to be a want of wives an evil which happily does not affect the mother country amidst all her other sufferings the evil has probably been aggravated by some of the colonists forgetting to take their wives with them if matters don't get better in this particular we may expect to hear of some of the adjoining american towns suffering a sabine spoliation a cargo of young ladies would evidently be one of the best mercantile speculations and as our own city had surplus of ten or twelve thousand females at the last census we have no doubt that some of our enterprising export traders will take the hint and by scouring the boardingschools complete a choice assortment adapted to the illinois market the following extracts the only parts that appear to have any general interest english prairie july my friends and countrymen—for your service i exhibited in two publications an outline of the process of emigration from its commencement up to the final settlement my first opinion of this the spot of our choice and the reasoning on which that choice was grounded are before you and sufficient time has elapsed to try those opinnions by the test of experience by which they are confirmed in every important particular i showed you my own tract through the gloomy forest into a delightful country better prepared for an abode by the hand of nature than the heavy woods by half a century of labour i built me a cabin and belayed a road to it for it was my ambition to be surrounded by my old friends and neighbours in this too i am gratified and we are contented with out allotment both as to our present state and future prospects this small district which two years ago was nearly without inhabitants contains a thriving population of from six to seven hundred persons we have been blessed with health most unusual for a new settlement or for any settlement of equal numbers in any country and no doubt is entertained by us or by any judicious observer of its salubrity we have several wells of excellent water and many more are in progress our soil is fertile beyond my own expectation but our exertions have hitherto been chiefly directed to the permanent objects of building and fencing of which much has already been done we have however collected a stock of hogs and cattle and i think acres of corn are now growing than there are individuals in the settlement with regard to pecuniary success the capitalist is commencing his operations or looking around him undecided as to the course he shall pursue but the labourer has made an establishment it is not with him as with the capitalist a state of hope merely from good prospects but of enjoyment from good possessions numbers of this class and of mechanics have already realized their little freeholds and are building cabins for themselves the fruits of their labour are not squandered in dissipation and excess because they have highr objects and considering their former depressed condition it is astonishing to me as it is honourable to them that they betry no arrogance in their to independence in the statements i have published i see little to correct as far as my observation and experience have now proceeded excepting that in my view of the profits of cultivation to early settlers i have not made sufficient allowance in time for the innumerable delays and disappointments inseparable from new undertakings in a new country a year of preparatory and unproductive exertion should be added to the debtorside of the account at the outset proceedings of the court lord provost manderston having been called to the chair the clerk mr a boswell read a very distinct report of the results and general features of the transactions at the infirmary and queensberry house hospital for the last year the lord provost then named a committee to examine the treasurer's accounts &c and report to the adjourned meeting to be held in february next mr john witham junior then rose and requested leave to submit a few observations to the consideration of the court he stated in substance that though aware of its not being usual to vote thanks to the managers until their accounts have been examined he was yet anxious to embrace the first opportunity of expressing his conviction that the exertions of the managers had at last placed this valuable institution on a most desirable footing although he had not visited the hospital for the last twelve months he had not ceased to take an interest in its welfare and it was with great pleasure that he now stated that whether his inquiries were made of the medical attendants or of recent patients the answers were uniformly satisfactory the hospital was favoured with a good matron between whom and the medical gentlemen the best understanding existed and the various salutary regulations of the managers have led to such a prosperous state of things as justly to entitle them to the gratitude of this court and the public still however he must say that although the hospital was in a good state yet in his mind visitors could not fall to afford that assistance to the managers here and that security against internal abuses which they had done in so many other similar institutions it was difficult to account for the prejudices which existed against this species of assistance in edinburgh at leeds in addition to visitors of our sex there was a committee of ladies who visisted the female wards and from the joint labours of both classes of visitors many and great advantages had resulted but in this city we had hospitals for females which are governed by men only without seeking any help from visitors of that sex who are much better qualified to discharge most of the duties this view of these matters he trusted would yet be attended to—he must also crave the attention of the meeting to another matter that of the l for which the city of edinburgh pays only per cent he assured the court and its honoured chairman that this subject was not introduced with the view of touching upon or insinuating any thing respecting the city's affairs the money he understood was secured on the ale duty but why should the hospital lose onehalf per cent of interest he had once made a calculation according to which the loss from the beginning had amounted to about l it had been stated that the magistrates of edinburgh had always been friendly to the hospital but that was surely no reason for withholding l of interest that whatever former magistrates had thought on the subject the present would not submit to the idea of depriving the hospital of any part of its lawful interest if the ground on which the hospital was built was alluded to it was plain that town had already got more by the reduced interest than its original value the town of edinburgh had also got l of invalid money from government on condition of paying the interest to the infirmary which inte rest if paid at two terms in the years should be restricted to per cent and as the property tax—which the town did not retain from the hospital whether they did or did not pay it to government—is now at an end he could see no reason for withholding the usual rate of interest he concluded by suggesting the names of several gentlemen as a committee to lend out the sum of l on interest at per cent if the magistrates of edinburgh should decline to pay that rate of interest mr alex cruishank seconded the motion col crichton regretted that the respectable gentlemen should have introduced such a motion he seldom visisted the infirmary but when he sent patients to it but he could state that when his servants or workmen have been there from fever the attention they received was in every respect equal to what he and he hoped he was a respectable citizen could command in his own house but he could mention the testimony of one whose authority was much higher than his own — that of a medical gentlemen of some eminence in his profession who lives abroad and who was recently in this country that professional gentleman spoke the very highest terms both of the medical treatment and the economy of the house it was matter of pride he said to every scotsman to hear the manner in which the infirmary of edinburgh was spoke of in all the quarters of the globe it was the pattern of all that was excellent in such institutions and a nursery of the most skilfull practitioners for go where we will the answer to almost every question put with respect to improved hospital treatment is that it was learned in the infirmary of edinburgh whether indeed we thought of these things whether we looked at the sublime inscriptions on the outside of the hospital and the christain doctrines and principles there inculcated or the treatement and management within we could not fail to be struck with admiration and without imputing any motives which he was not entitled to do he must say it would be much more creditable to the respectable gentlemen if they should confine themselves to expressing their high opinion of the institution and tanking the managers instead of occupying the valuable time of this honourable court with quibbling about trifles which were every way contemptible after a pause col crichton made a counter motion to get rid of mr wigham's lord meadowbank reminded the court that this matter of interest had already been under the consideration of a committee and decided on by the court henry jardine esq begged to mention a fact that the town of edinburgh had contributed l to the infirmary for the last year mr ritchie rose and said that though perfectly aware of what the result would be he could not allow the matter to be settled without giving mr wigham's motion his support it gave him much pleasure to find it was no longer unfashionable to allude to christian doctrines in such meetings as this—a change from which he anticipated much good he concurred in what had been said on this subject by the gentleman at the foot of the table but he begged to remind him that it was a great principle of christianity that nothing was too trifling to be attended to it it promised good and the additional interest of the money in question would obviously extend the means of healing the sick the great object of the institution nothing indeed which had fallen from that gentleman or the learned lord on the other side could meet or touch the simple proposition that five per cent is the legal rate of interest and that the town of edinburgh ought not to pay less there was another subject alluded to by mr wigham on which if mr w did not he would submit a motion namely visitori 'and this he conceived was the fittest time for appointing them all sides of the house were now agreed that the hospital was admirably conducted it was impossible therefore to suppose that the measure was proposed from any distrust of the managers if the management was perfect now it was too much to expect it could continue so and this was the proper time for providing against the future in other places the highest characters in the land had acted with visitors and much benefit had been derived from them in england and even at glasgow if human nature therefore was not different in edinburgh from wht it is on the other side of the tweed and in the west of scotland it must be admitted that visitors would be beneficial here also besides as the managers were aware of their strength and that no measure could be carried here without their consent the granting of visitors would be a boon from themselves he moved that this court do annually name or more visitors to act monthly by rotation and minute such observations as shall occur to them for the consideration of the managers mr wigham seconded the motion but as the court seemed averse to entertain it it was withdrawn mr ritchie then said that as his last motion was intended chiefly as a caveat to the committee named by the lord provost he would also with the same view state the nature of a motion which he wished to submit but the merits of which he was not then fully prepared to state it was one however of which he was sure it would not be said that it was introduced for the purpose of giving trouble or unnecessarily occupying the time of the court its object was the promotion of medical science and its nature would be understood by his reading a single paragraph from the able clinical reports of dr duncan junior almost all hospitals it is there stated publish annual reports but in many cases they are intended only to furnish information as to the expenditure of the funds and the names of the officebearers and as a public acknowledgement of the support of the subscribers such reports however are of no use in marking the progress of disease and except for purposes mentioned above do positive harm by causing hospital reports in general to be neglected as utterly without value this however is not the case and the reports we have of late years received from the fever hospitals of dublin and cork are worthy of being imitated by hospitals of every kind and in every place indeed the public have a right to expect this information in return for their liberality in supporting them we have only to add that the most valuable reports often proceed entirely from the zeal of the reporters and are only occasional this leads us to suggest that the governors of hospitals should enjoin their regular as a duty upon their medical officers and we will venture to say that where it has not yet been practised its good effects upon the institution in an economical as well as professional points of view will soon be apparent—his motion went to carry this suggestion into effect and without farther preface he should now read it the substance of it was that in addition to the journal kept at present digest of the whole should be kept in a tabular form but especially of the date of admission age sex and place of residence of the patients date of commencement crisis termination and assigned causes of their diseases with a diary of the temperatures and moisture of the atmosphere state of winds prices of staple provisions &c with an annual medical report taking notice of the increase or decrease of population and of the employment diet and habits of the labouring classes as far as practicable some of the members he observed seemed to be amused with this enumeration but the medical gentlemen would be aware of what he pointed at with their peculiar and proper duties he had no wish to interfere they knew them well and discharged them faithfully and honourably in their practise they attended to every thing that was necessary but their knowledge often died with him and his object was to preserve the results of their skill and experience the lord president said he hoped the gentlemen who had made this motion would see on reflection from the labour and time requisite to carry it into effect how very impracticable it would be in an hospital like that of the royal infirmary where the managers had no compulsory authority over the medical gentlemen whose time was so occupied with their own private avocations the proposer of the motion said that instead answering what had fallen from the right honourable judge in his own language he would beg leave to read another passage from dr duncan's voluble publication and which he hoped would obviate some of the difficulties adverted to the trouble says dr duncan of keeping such tabular records is not so great as might be supposed it requires only system and regularity and when we see how easily it is done in the military hospital we cannot help regretting that it is not also in troduced general into civil hospitals if the practitioner himself has not time to fill up the columns of the prescribed table it would be very little additional trouble to his clerk or if the time of that assistant would not easily permit him the duty would be very gladly taken by another of the hospital pupils dr hope in a neat and eloquent speech opposed the motion the managers he said were willing to give due consideration to every proposal from whatever quarter it might come the present however he considered as impractiable to prepare tabular records of the nature suggested required great experience much comprehension and many talents it was a task which every one was not qualified to discharge in a mnner could be beneficial to the public and one which gentlemen who lived by their profession could not be expected to undertake the case was different in military hospitals where the medical getlmen could devote the whole of their time to their hospital duties but it should be know that the materials for making up such tables are all recorded in the infirmary journals and that these journals are open to all the medical attendants so that whoever finds that he has time and talents for the performance of such tasks has the fullest opportunity for undertaking and completing them accordingly we had had the very able reports of dr duncan and the useful work of dr welsh the institution has now the benefit of dr duncan's services and he considered it better to leave the completion of such works and reports to the zeal and talents of individuals the mover then stated that he was perfectly aware of dr welsh's judicious publication as well as dr duncan's and he certainly would never have introduced such a measure had it not been suggested and recommended by a much abler mind than his own he had not undertaken the task from any idea that he was able to do it justice or that he could do it better or even so well as many other members of the court but from the conviction that if he had not introduced the subject it would be introduced at all he had no wish however to give unnecessary trouble and should therefore for the present beg leave to withdraw his motion form of process in the justiciary court our readers will learn with pleasure that the lord advocate with a laudable anxiety for the honour of our criminal jurisprudence has announced officially that the clerk of court strikes the jury by taking after until they served in rotation they consist of a list of jurymen furnished by the high constables for edinburgh and those regularly required from the counties of linlithgow and haddington which names were then put upon a roll which was put into the bands of the clerk of court—the jurors thus struck being cited not by a sheriff officer but by a macer of the justiciary ourt we are not aware of any law which requires the clerk of court to take the jurors by rotation but it reflects great credit on his judgement that he resorts to this unequivocal mode of displaying his impartiality this is a virtue which the law requires in all its officers and it is fortunate when such rules are devised and adhered to as make the virtue incontrovertibly visible at such an advanced stage of society honour and public opinion will secure impartial justice but still when the possibility of some retrograde movement is adverted to it would be a wise measure to convert what all functionaries do at present from principle into specific rules for directing the conduct of their successors the lord advocate it has been reported is about to introduce into parliament a bill or bills respecting the judicatories of scotland and his lordship it is obvious might obtain a wellmerited popularity by throwing in some clauses to fix the qualifications of a juror in the different counties of scotland and to regulate the times and the manner in which lists of jurors are to be made up reduced into a penl of and then to a jury of ther is if we mistake not a cerain discretion on more than one of these points left with functionaries who we doubt not would most readily part with it to them it would be a relief and though the arraigned might sometimes have less impartial juries than at present yet if the ballot were introduced here as it has recently been in civil cases the impartiality would be more coguisable and placed beyond the reach of doubt and misrepresentation it would be no disgrace to scotland to borrow in this respect from her sister kingdom but an honour which france seems willing to do herself at present and which we very lately did ourselves in modelling our jury court mr bywater has construced a small model of a ship in such a manner as to exhibity by actual experiment the principal magnetic phenomena mentioned by captain flinders in his voyage to new holland from a minute attention to the subject mr b has devised a

particular cases render prudent his next question is where shall he go—to the united states or to canada we shall suppose the persons emigrating to be friends to the british constitution for if they are not there is no question because levellers and democrats will find themselves in a bad situation in coming to canada as they will find no kindred spirits there but though we can willingly spare such as these to lose good subjects is a serious evil to the empire and to lose them through ignorance and the want of that information which it is in our power to give is a folly as well as all evil i am persuaded that all emigrants of the description we mention would rather prefer to remain undue their own government than to live under and swear allegiances to another provided no greater sacrifices were required in going to the one than to the other i am indeed quite certain that many would consent willing to a considerable sacrifice for this advantage so agreeable to their feelings and habits but we shall shew that no such sacrifice is required and that their interest as well as inclination when duly considerd will lead them to upper canada in going to the united states we have mr birkbeck's authority that 'no good settlement can be made cast of the alleghany mountains or in the atlantic states' the lands are now so dear as to be in general far beyond the reach of common emigrants who have seldom much left after landing in america suppose two families to land in america—one at new york or philadelphia on the way to mr birkbeck's settlement and one at quebec on the way to upper canada miles from philadelphia to pittsburgh from pittsburgh down the ohio to shawanoe town from shawanoe town to mr birkbeck's settlement expense of a family travelling this route supposing the family to consist of ten persons and to carry with them two tons of goods dollars from philadelphia to pittsburgh at eight dollars per cwt the expense of the family who accompany the waggon at one dollar each per day from pittsburgh to shawanoe by water down the ohio miles an ark or large scow must be purchased hands hired to go down and they must be paid to return as much from philadelphia to pittsburgh from shawanoe town to mr birkbeck for baggage and person to purchase two hundred acres of land at two dollars per acre total expenses the same family landed at quebec pays to montreal miles two dollars each for the good[] from montreal to kingston miles up the river st lawrence goods and persons for the batteau can take all if the family proceed to york which is seldom necessary as kingston miles within the province and lands in its neighbourhoods to be sold or granted there will be an additiona expense of to such a family possessed of property government might grant acres on paying fees about or it may be purchased at two dollars per acres total expenses from this calculation it is seen that the settler with his large family by coming to upper canada instead of joining mr birkbeck even if he purchases his lands at the same price saves dollars which will enable him to clear a large portion of his farm stock it and build a comfortable house and if he be granted the land instead of purchasing it there is a further saving of dollars let us now see what the product at mr birkbeck's settlement in the illinois and in upper canada will command in the market for notwithstanding the greatness of the first saving in coming to upper canada if the markets be inferior it might soon be balanced illinois upper canada wheat per bushel t wheat per bushel t india corn india corn oats oats hay per ton hay per ton butter per lb butter per lb cheese cheese fowls per couple fowls per couple t t nb these prices taken from mr birkbeck's book are t per cent above the truth from this table it is manifest that the produce raised in upper canada sells at an advance of upwards of per cent on what the same can be sold in the illinois territory supposing mr birkbeck's prices correct which they are not being much too high the vast advantage therefore in coming to upper canada must appear manifest it may by some be said that the families are too numerous as there are few that consist of ten persons but the results will be proportionally the same whatever the number be and if we suppose them to consist of persons in comfortable circumstances in their own country they will commonly bring servants with them by which the average will be still greater but this is of no moment the difference of expense in travelling miles or is sufficiently clear we must add to the disadvantage of mr birkbeck's farmer the dearness of all those articles which he has to purchase for his distance from the seacoast and market operates in two ways to his disadvantage 'his produce is low and the goods from are dear the shopkeeper who is at a great distance from the place where the articles he deals in are procured will add to the price when he disposes of the the additional expense of bringing and the time lost in procuring them to him who is obliged to take a journey of miles to procure his articles of merchandize the cost and trouble must be very great and all this he makes the consumer pay the journey which mr birkbeck's merchant is obliged to take is a very serious one compared to that of the merchant of york or niagara the latter in consequence of this situation can trade with a smaller capital than the former because he can at any time procure a fresh supply in a few days while the former can lay in a stock of goods only once ayear now all these difficulties are to be paid for by the farmers and mechanics who consume the articles imported the difference to them in the course of a twelvemonth by receiving less for the articles they sell and paying more for those they purchase will be found to be very great 'it is not merely the quantum he shall raise but the sun he shall get for it which constitutes the farmer's advantage it is not simply to get enough to eat and drink that is to bound the desires of the farmer it is to procure the means of converting his logcabin into a handsome and convenient house—to erect a large barn for his grain and suitable buildings for his cattle—to educate his children—and as he grows old to enjoy the satisfaction of finding that his industry has supplied the comforts of life and enabled him to satisfy the wants of society—wants to which we are indebted for amelioration of mankind' in the selection of a place to residence in a new country it is very important to take into view the ultimate market for the farmer's produce while the country is settling there will be no difficulty for the increasing population will demand all the supplies that can be raised but the prudent settler will look beyond that period and consider what he shall do when every one raises more grain than he will be able to consume in that case vicinity to market and facility of transportation are all important now the produce of upper canada can be sent to montreal one of the best markets in america in five or six days at a trifling expense which is yearly diminishing as the waters are improved very different is the case with the farmer in the western division of the united states the immense distance which grain has to be sent occasions the expense to be so great as frequently to equal and sometimes exceed the price offered when it reaches the market the more that this statement is examined the more correct it will be found and the superior advantages of canada will appear in a stronger light but having been a landholder it is time to instruct the emigrant how he is to make his living out of it emigration among the emigrants proceeding to seek another country on the shores of southern africa four vessels containing above souls have sailed from liverpool bound to the cape of good hope three of them under the command and direction of a naval officer and one under private superintendance the public agent

perth upper canada th january — liberty and equality are the predominant principles here a common labourer from scotland is entitled to a lot of land whenever he finds he can subsist upon his farm he becomes as high as the best in the township every settler though ever so poor has a vote for the member for the township and has full liberty to speak at every meeting — it is nothing uncommon to see a poor glasgow weaver who came among us with scarce a stitch to cover his nakedness strutting between the stumps of his trees as pompous as an ediburgh magistrate necessity of legislative measures for relieving the distress of the labouring classes salus populi suprema lex t here wasa time when it was held pure factiousness to doubt whether the prosperity we enjoyed during the first ten or twelve years of the late war was perfectly sound and natural and whether it would not ultimately entail upon us a corresponding share of future calamity but the most gloomy anticipations of those who were most inclined to view the picture on the dark side have certainly come infinitely short of the full measure of distress and misery which have at length fallen upon the country it would be unjust to charge the government with any more of these evils than might have been foreseen but now that they force themselves on the attention on all sides it is perfectly fair to hold the government accountable for all that it can remove or prevent and yet suffers to exist this is the first time we believe in modern history when the evil of an excess of population has come so distinctly under the notice of a government as to call for a legislative remedy the case is therefore new and the course to be pursued is the less obvious but the war was a season of bold experiments in which we surmounted many difficulties once deemed insuperable and if timidity tie up our hands now when humanity calls upon us to move the world may well say that the boasted energy of the government has been entirely reserved for the supply of its own wants out of the pockets of the people but that when a period of public calamity requiress exertions of a more painful kind it is startled by the smallest difficulty and will not even make such a slight effort as might evince its sympathy with the sufferers during the late war the industry of the country was stimulated into a state of unprecedented activity by the monopoly we obtained of the commerce of the world—by thirty or forty millions of the capital of the country being annually melted down and consumed—and by the continual rise of prices produced by the depreciation of the currency the great demand for labour arising out of this state of things with the consequent increase of wages caused a rapid augmentation in the numbers of the people in the ten years ending the rate of increase in britain was such as would have doubled the population in fiftytwo years and in the great manufacturing districts it probably equalled what takes place in a new colony when the peace came and was followed by the destruction of our commercial monopoly the cessation of the annual loans and the diminuition of the paper issues the sources of our fictitious prosperity were dried up at once a vast reduction took place in the demand for labour profits and wages fell with prices while the pressure of the taxes were doubled and onethird added to their real amount by the rise in the value of money the laws however which regulate the multiplication of human beings cannot instantly bend to circumstances a long period necessarily elapses before the population accommodates itself to the diminished demand for labour and during this period the labouring classes must suffe extreme misery in this state we are at present and time from which we hoped relief has only aggravated the evil there are but three remedies upon which any dependence can be placed — a reduction of taxation — a change in our commercial system — and emigration we have little hopes as to the first since this would require a sacrifice on the part of the government of its own interest real or supposed which we see no disposition to make a relaxation in our restrictive commercial system has not the same obstacles to encounter and we have repeated shewn that it would be highly beneficial the reluctance of ministers to attempt a change that may prejudice the interest of some particular classes might be considered as a prudent caution were it not observed that when instead of relieving the distress of the people the object is to suppy the necessities of the treasury none of this caution appears but the complaints of the sufferers are disregarded as vulgar clamour but the crisis is now such that tenderness to the interests of a few individuals may be cruelty to the public at large though we shall preach free trade to other nations rather with a bad grace when we can no longer hold our monopoly it is so far well that our misfortunes are at last likely to open our eyes to truths whch were familiar to philosophers half a century ago in our present circumstances we may perhaps almost be thankful that a systematic error which has impeded our career has kept this one resource open to us emigration suggests itself so naturally as a remedy for a redundant population that we are rather surprised there should be much reluctance to have recourse to it we need not be afraid that the practise will continue longer than the necessity which produces it the vis intertiae of people in general says malthus and their attachment to their homes are qualities so strong and general that we may rest assured they will not emigrate unless from political discontents or extreme poverty they are in such a state as will make it as much for the advantages of their country as of themselves that they should go out of it we by no means underrate the difficulties that attend emigration upon a large scale but these are partly occasioned by the absurd practise of directing it exclusively to our own colonies we have vast multitudes whom we can neither feed nor employ and surely the first and most pressing object is to send them where they will find the means of subsistence there are many parts of the world besides our own colonies open to receive them and whether they go to the united states brazil buenos ayres or to canada new holland or the cape of good hope the advantage to this country will be nearly the same among so many countries of such extent it would not be very difficult to dispose of half a million of persons young and old within the course perhaps of two years but upon whatever scale emigration is conducted it must be gradual and this renders it the more important to fix upon a plan early ministers have lately announced that canada cannot receive more emigrants at present without inconvenience but had the intention of sending great numbers to that colony been made public two years ago corn would have been raised for them and men of some capital assured of finding abundance of labourers would have gone out and settled and provided employment for those who have not the means to establish themselves as farmers the alarm we feel of seeing manufactures raised up in other countries by the skill of our expatriated artisans is very ill founded many other advantges must be combined with the possession of mechanical skill to make manufactures flourish and when the former are found able workmen will not be long wanting our capital our improved means of internal communication our coal fields our laws for the protection of industry and property the free enlightened and active spirit of our people with the powers of combination resulting from the union of so many advantages within so small a space are better securities for our superiority in manufactures than attempts which must be nugatory to retain a monopoly of operative skill and talent but the opinion which exists in foreign countries as to the superiority of our people in every branch of industry will have this good effect that it will secure out emigrants a favourable reception though the emigration to afford any sensible relief to the whole country would require to be upon an extensive scale it is yet obvious that even upon the smallest scale it is beneficial if six labourers are withdrawn from a small village or fifty from a country town the situation of either will be improved the plan hitherto acted on by government of givingassistance to those only who could raise ten on fifteen pounds is chiefly objectionable because it must restrict the emigration within very narrow limits if by sending away men who are still able to subsist by their labour others now living on charity get employment we are in effect relieved of so many paupers but the former are less disposed to leave the country and with regard to those who are or must soon become paupers it will certainly be found more economical to pay ten or fiften pounds each to send them abroad than to maintain them permanently home it is in vain however to look to private charity for the funds necessary for such an undertaking these must be raised by the country at large and whether a tax be imposed for the special purpose or money destined for other objects be applied to this the country we have no doubt is ready to make the sacrifice suppose that even so great a sum as five millions were required this is but the half of what england alone pays every year for poor rates and what is such a sum if it were to afford certain relief on an emergency lke the present if the french and dutch should again disagree about the navigation of the scheldt or if we should quarrel with the french or americans about the traffic in a few hundred wild catskins on the other side of the globe how easily would a sum ten times as large be found nothing more is requisite than to take on half of the sum for two years which mr vansittart allots for paying off the national debt we not only conceive that it would be wise and creditable to divert a part or the whole of the actual sinking fund to this purpose but we go so far as to think that it is little less than disgraceful to pay off any debt at all at this crisis with funds wrung from the earnings of a starving population whatever is done it is of vast importance to understand that the most pressing evil though not absolutely permanent in its nature cannot be expected to subside of itself for many years we have not only an excess of population to dispose of but we have to check the principle of increase which is rapidly aggravating the evil in the five years ending the population of england added oneseventieth part to its numbers annually and if we suppose the ratio to have been the same for the whole empire each year must have had individuals more to provide for than the preceding till the whole of this vast annual inrease is got rid of the present excess of numbers will not diminish but augment and how is it to be got rid of either the annual births must diminish more than onethird or famine and disease must destroy a quarter of a million of human beings annually beyond the usual rate of mortality or these two causes must operate together notwithstanding therefore the misery of the labouring classes at this moment we doubt whether the population is not still on the increase and whether still more afflicting scenes are not awaiting us indeed unless measures are taken to do away the factitious stimulus which the english poorlaws give to the increase of population the most abundant emigration will prove but a feeble palliative these are rather discouraging circumstances but the evil must be dealt with in some way or it will ultimately overwhelm us it has now become rather a question of humanitiy than of policy one or two millions of human beings have been suddenly deprived of their means of subsistence by events over which they had no control with such a mass of individuals goaded to desperation by want—a deficient crop—a sudden revulsion in trade—a more general exclusion of our manufactures by the americans—any of those numerous casualties in short to which every nation is exposed would place us in a situation frightful to contemplate plots and insurrections will keep up a continual alarm neither persons nor property will be safe and capital will gradually leave the country if theory were silent experience must now convince us that time alone will produce no material amelioration in our circumstances and the relief which is may ultimately bring will be obtained only through the destruction of vast multitudes by famine and disease in the fifth year of peace it is now time to look the evil in the face and either to make some great sacrifices for its removal or to brace our minds to bear the dreadful alternative it is in vain to disguise the matter to our own consciences those who propose to leave things to what they call the course of nature are in substance recommending that thousands of their fellowcreatures should be suffered to rot away from the effect of absolute want that such a thing should take place in the extract of a letter received from calcutta dated d november an afflicting circumstance has recently taken place the captain of the bengal a liverpool trader very lately gave a ball on board his ship which was about to sail for england the party was very small and more than half were taken ill with a violent fever immediately afterwards i buried the captain and the surgeon a few days after it not less than ten of the part died within as many days all younger persons only one officer survives of those who left england in the ship and he is just recovering in the hospital all sorts of conjectures were made but it turns out that there were undressed buffalo horns in the hold in a complete state of putrefaction this vessel has sailed for england in this state without a surgeon i question whether it will ever arrive it ought not to be admitted among other shipping if it does—the opening of the hold will be death to him who does it and perhaps to many morein consequence of this disastrous information ministers have issued an order for the vessel on her arrival at liverpool or any other part to undergo quarantine—london paper all apprehension on the above subject is completely done away by the following letter from liverpool may — i noticed a paragraph in the london papers respecting the bengal of this port at calcutta stating that a number of deaths had taken place supposed in consequence of the infectious vapours arising from some buffalo horns—the bengal arrived here april and has been discharged without any of those dreadful consequences which the medical gentlemen of calcutta prognosticated—i should rather suppose that the fatal consequences which ensued to those individuals who attended the ball given on board this vessel at calcutta would be none justly attributed to the exposure to night air canada the following is an extract of a private letter dated halifax may at two o'clock this day the earl of dalhousie captaingeneral and governorinchief of british north america attended by the admiral his majesty's council the staff naval and military officers and the principal people of the place attended to lay the first stone of a new college to be erected at the north end of the grand parade the whole of the freemasons of halifax went in grand procession they formed in lodges at their hall and preceded by a military band and followed by another they marched to the places prepared for them on the building his lordship came on the scaffolding at two o'clock the grenadiers of the d regiment being his guard of honour detachments from each regiment kept the ground after a prayer by the rev mr twining grand chaplain lord dalhousie addressed the assembly in a speech of which i have not time to give an outline but in it his lordship mentioned that the building was intendeed as a college upon the plan of that of edinburgh where all students who professed the christian religion were eligible for admittance strangers residing here for a short time might also enjoy the benefit of the institution and gentlemen in the army the navy and the military establishments his lordship concluded a most eloquent and animated address with his fervent wishes for the welfare and prosperity of the undertaking a bottle with coins and a tin case with parchments &c were then severally deposited in the recess made for them and the stone was lowered into its place with all the requisite and due forms under a royal salute from fort charlotte after which the rev the grand chaplain closed the proceedings with a prayer and the whole assembled multitude gave nine cheers—the military and masonic processions then returned in the same order in which they came the day was beautiful and a greater assemblage of people was never witnessed in halifax the countess of dalhousie and her two sons mrs admiral griffith and the misses wilson and most of the fashionable ladies here witnessed the ceremony from a convenient scaffolding prepared for them lord dalhousie purposes to leave halifax for quebec in his majesty's ship newcastle on the st of june without waiting for sir james kempt court of chancery—june will of the late duke of queensberry mr head stated that he had to present a petition from the annuitants and legates of the late duke of queensberry praying that a fourth more of their claims might be paid there now being sufficient funds in the hands of the accountantgeneral for that purposes the learned counsel said that there was no less a sum than l accumulated and vested in the name of this officer in bank stock for the benefit of the claimants and he understood it was not intended to oppose the application although the executors did not say they would give their consent to it some consultation had been had on the subject out of doors he therefore prayed that the prayer of the petition should be granted the attorneygeneral said he had not received any instructions nor had he been consulted the several king's counsel in court spoke in behalf of their respective clients mr wingfield appeared for the earl of yarmouth and said his lordship was anxious that the business should be put in a train of settlement the lord chancellor said there was not a man existing that had a heart in him but must wish the legacies and annuities to be paid but said his lordship the marquis of queensberry has commenced an action for the recovery of l against the executor and he certainly had a right so to do it it was therefore proper that the court should see that no harm arose to the executors before the funds were allowed to go out of court with respect to their not opposing the petition that was very different to consenting to it it merely said to the court mind you do right mr heald said if his lordship thought that onefourth was too much they would take an eight or any part his lordship pleased the lord chancellor—i will order it to stand first on the paper for tuesday next and in the mean time i will look over the petition the new york daily advertiser says—the line of battle ship new york now finishing at our navy yard at the wallabut is perhaps the most superior vessel ever built her tonnage is near [] she measures feet keel and is by feet the largest man of war ever laid down in this country she will no doubt be rated a but will be equal to a gunship and will carry guns india we have great pleasure in publishing the following interesting letter from india — madras feb i have thank god no very brilliant events to communicate to you but if the happiness of man is the legitimate object of all government it is good to learn that british india is at peace and that a temperate and radical reform is gradually going on under the marquess of hastings' administration the establishment of schools and a free press are the moving principles by which this great advancement in the state of society will be accomplished unless checked by impious powers on the subject of these schools it is not necessary here to dilate suffice it to observe that it is in the power of any government abitrary or free to educate the great bulk of its subjects and thereby to advance them in knowledge civilization and happiness in the shortest possible period the establishment of a free press in asia is in my estimation as useful and magnanimous an art as ever adorned the biography of any statesman what say its detractors is setting loose a parcel of printer's devils so great an act no but setting loose all the intelligence of the age to work upon the public mind and conduct is an act of unrivalled benevolence be it asserted that a free press is only applicable to an advanced state of society i deny the position it is not founded in reason or experience i contend on the other hand that where least knowledge and msot evil exist there is the greatest scope for improvement and i offer scotland as a proof of the efficacy[] of education and a free press the marquess of hastings governor general of india has in the newspapers of madras and calcutta been accused of having sent two persons of the name of hastings to unhealthy climates the one to the east and the other to the west indies where they died and for the base purpose of securing to his family the title of huntingdon this you must be aware was touching his sensitive honour to the quick and it would seem as if some one inimical to a free press had introduced the paragraph to irritate him but this virtuous man who would not tread on an insect allowed this shameful slander to pass unnoticed it stood refuted in every bosom and his manly forbearance tended but to give further proofs of his attachment to our infant liberty attacks have likewise been made on sir e east our chief justice he complained they say of these alleged libels to the chief magistrate who desired him to have recourse to the law conceive not however that i am the advocate for a licentious press my maxim is that a great power when mischievously applied must be hurtful and when well applied beneficial in proportion to its strength you will rejoice to learn that mr elphinstone governor of bombay has done away with the censorship of the press this wise statesman being a friend to freedom and having experienced the benefits which had arisen in bengal from the measure for scarce a day no passes that some abuse is not brought to light by the press adopted it the moment he came into power and thus proved himself a public benefactor to conclude it is my firm conviction that the diffusion of knowledge through the medium of education and a free press will more than any other measure accelerate the improvement and heighten the prosperity not only of british india but of the surrounding world maritime intelligence the jane

might not like it but yet would not find any good pretence for resisting it and his catholic majesty would yield to the influence of all europe with the better grace as his former dependencies would be only transferred to a branch of his own family the king of france would furnish assistance of every king and employ every means even to the supply of troops for carrying the affair into execution on the th of october last when the statement of his conference reached buenos ayres rondeau then director ad interim made a secret communication to the congress and transmitted to them the letter of the envoy together with the french memorial on the following day and on the d of november the matter was discussed in secret meetings and the result was an[] opinion that the constitution latelysworn allowed no alteration to be made in the form of government till after the meeting of the chambers that a branch of the bourbon family so closely connected with the reigning monarch of spain was in itself an insuperable objection as also the consideration that the prince proposed and supported by the powers of the european continent would naturally more incline towards the views of his protectors than towards those of south america which ought to avoid all connexion with european continental politics and that great britain was the power from which south america had most to fear and most to expect it was at the same time suggested that the envoys in europe shoud put the communications from paris into the hands of the british minstry whose good opinion and protection south america is most anxious to conciliate our cabinet has always treated the south americans with the greatest reserve as if feating contamination by simple contact—a delicacy towards spanish interests and feelings which appears in itself commendable but when measured by the standard of national benefit may not merit the same praise as it is it would seem that the british interest is likely to gain the ascendacy in the river plate rather through the disposition of the inhabitants than from any influence exerted by our ministers we shall only add that thought the negotiation was carried on by the duke de cazes the project did not originate with him and did not at first apply to the prince de lucca it was intended as an opening for one more nearly allied to the reigning family in france emigration we extract the following statement from the montreal herald and an important one it is to those who are desirous of emigrating as well as to those who from patriotic motives would wish to turn the tide of emigration into a channel which while it relieve the mother country now may hereafter add to her strength and resources number of british subjects that emigrated to the united states who received recommendations for grants of land and removed to the province of upper canada from james buchanan esq his majesty's consul at new york in the year — english { farmers women children mechanics women children } scotch { farmers women children mechanics women children } irish { farmers women children mechanics women children } total we cannot give publicity to the above return without observing how eminently calculated such a document is to open the eyes of our too credulous yet industrious and loyal countrymen many of whom are still disposed to look to the united statesm as the abode of independence and the source of affluence here we see nearly british subjects who in one season through the agency alone of one of our consulswithoutany pecuniary aid have removed from the united states to upper canada their trieal and failure in the former as well as the trial and failure of the great numbers who have returned to this country are circumstances well calculated to direct the attention of those who have emigration in view at once to upper canada we have made enquiry about these hitherto unknown but truly fertile regions and we are informed from a most authentic and satisfactory source that there there are unlocated lands fertile beyond the conception of those who have not seen them capable of receiving ten millions of inhabitants that the winters are not so cold nor the summers so hot as in the state of new york that these regions have proved eminently healthy to the vast numbers that have poured into them of late years and that the administration of the laws the state of education and religious instruction and above all the peace and quiet of the inhabitants have found there have exceed their most sanguine expectations it may be desirable to state that grown persons can get by water from quebec to york the capital of upper canada for about s children half price that to all persons properly recommended as to good conduct a grant of land is given according to their means of cultivation that this grant becomes their own for ever and they may dispose of it as they please colony at the cape of good hope extract of a letter dated off madeira aurora transport ship feb an opportunity having offered for transmitting a hasty account of the aurora and brilliant transports proceeding with settlers to the cape of good hope i feel happy in availing myself of that circumstance with a view as well to gratify our friends in england as to add another confirmation of the liberality of government in our important undertaking first it will be necessary to state that the two ships sail in company and are every day within hail of each other the former commanded by captain pearson and the latter by captain bothwell who is accompanied by lieutenant pritchard as agent to both vessels we sailed from gravesend on our course down channel was most favourable and the weather has hitherto been propitious no death disease or serious accident has occurred in either ship and blooming health and vigour now rapidly succeed the langour produced by a sudden transition to a new element provisions consisting of flour currants suet[] oatmeal peas butter cheese tea sugar biscuit salt pork and beef of excellent quality are liberally supplied together with a proper allowance of rum vinegar mustard and spices the ships are fitted up in every respect comfortably and commodiously and the most perfect harmony prevails if we except bickerings amongst the old women about fractured teapots and mislaid culinary articles the attention paid to the comfort of the passengers and more especially to that of the women and children by the captains and the agent mr pritchard is highly creditable to the instructions received from government although i do not sail in the same ship captain bothwell i have had ample proofs of the kindness and humane liberality which he shews to the passengers in the brilliant captain pearson is an active intelligent officer who has been years in the transport service under government he has sailed to almost every part of the world and algoa bay our place of destination is quite familiar to him it may be egotism to speak of myself but i trust i may be excused in boasting that of the crew and passengers not one is seriously indisposed at present and wishing with heartfelt sincerity to my friends in england happiness peace and tranquility in as good health as i now enjoy long may they live long live the constitution and while on fish river or orange river we encounter the difficulties incident to new colonists may england and south africa be ever united by the ties of mutual friendship—the one affording her parental arms and the other mindful of her filial duty p campbell surgeon colonial intelligence we have received letters and papers from the cape of good hope to the d october and they are satisfactory in all points of view but especially with reference to the new settlement at algoa bay his excellency the governor sir r s donkin was taking some effectual measures to place the coinage of the colony upon a better footing and on the th of october he issued a proclamation for destroying a very large quantity of base money he has also taken measure to communicate to the new settlers from england the full benefit ofthe courts of justice esblished in that quarter of the world

event demerara gazettes to a late date have been received which give detailed accounts of the number and state of the slaves in that part of the west indies the report is given by james robertson esq the new slave registrat of the united colony it is a triennial statement of the slave population and the reporter makes some judicious comparative remarks it appears that there has been a large decrease of the number by deaths but the creoles are greatly increased as compared with the former year births have been in the proportion of one to fortysix the report defends the [] of the west

the flourishing state of the colony emigration—official enquiries and applications having been addressed to the colonial department respecting emigration to his majesty's foreign possessions it has been deemed convenient with a view to the information and guidance of individuals interest in this subject to state that stly persons are not provided with passages at the public expense to any of his majesty's settlements dly persons proceeding at their own expense to north america and to the cape of good hope and desirous of settling there require no previous authority from his majesty's secretary of state to enable them to obtain grants of land the governor of those settlements being fully empowered to assign lands to applicants proportioned to the means which they actually possess for bringing them into a state of cultivation the extent of these grants must depend upon their quality position and other circumstances which can only be ascertained in the colony dly persons desirous of settling in new south wales or van diemen's land must be provided with the sanction of his majesty's secretary of state and this can only be obtained upon written application accompanied by references to two or more respectable persons as to the character of the applicant and the extent of his capital which must amount to five hundred pounds at the least colonial department london january colonial intelligence success of the cutch expedition against the sindeans —the following extract of a letter from bombay bringing this intelligence we copy from carrick's post which appears to have exclusive means of obtaining information on india affairs— bombay sept while i was seeing the last of your goods on board last night a vessel arrived in the harbour having on board an officer from cutch who was the hearer of the official intelligence of the complete success of sir charles culville's expedition against the sindeans the expedition consisted of men commanded by his excellency the commander in chief from all i could clean of intellience from the followers it appeared there had been some hard fighting for five days but it ended as might be anticipated from the imposing force sent against the sindeans the moment the officer who is one of the staff and an irishman landed he set out for the government house to inform lady colville of the event as it must be supposed she was in a state og anxiety her husband being the commander and her brother and her uncle colonel t blair being also on the expedition at daylight this morning orders arrived from the government house to secure a passage and private cabin for the officer in th ship which takes this to england but there was no such accomodation as the cabins were all full and as another vessel will not sail from thence about ten days this and will be off today the chance is you will have this letter at least six weeks before the officers can reach england with the official intelligence all kinds of european produce are a drug hee paricularly fine goods and rum brandy and geneva are for a song the cholera has rather abated but still rages in a frightful manner the rio janeiro packet arrived on tuesday with letters to the st of november advices had been received from rio grande stating that artigas had been taken prisoner the portuguese frigate union had captured two insurgent privateers which had been committing depredations on the coast the events in portugal owing to which as well as to the idea that the king would be prudent enough to sanction what had taken place in portugal the prices of produce had experienced very trifling alteration though if the contrary should be the case a considerable rise was anticipated the following relates to what is passing in peru — extract of a letter from rio janeiro dated november — the chilians have at length carried into effect their boasted expedition which left valparaiso on the st august and arrived at pisco at the beginning of september san martin landed men but the blacks cattle &c had all been previously sent away from the estates in that quarter so that they will be disappointed in meeting with partisans indeed the slaves and lower orders whom they expected to find favourable to their views are the most irritated against the insurgents we have letters from lima to the th september which speaks of the little apprehensions entertained of san martin and his troops the viceroy having a formidable force in the capital and vicinity of men commanded by good officers the viceroy is commanderinchief la serna second and la mar and o'reilly command divisions they were observin san martin's movements who already experienced the difficulties of subsisting his men the marquis of vallembrozo was on his flank with a strong detachment of cavalry with a view to prevent him from sending emissaries into the interior and collecting horses it is thought the insurgents will soon have to reembark for as soon as they are a little pressed for provisions and fighting comes on numbers will desert those who have already come over describe their situation as very critical two vessels one an english and the other a french were preparing to sail from callao for this place and by them we shall receive further particulars the most enthusiastic preparations were making in lima to proclaim the constitution in a formal manner for which purpose orders had been received from madrid this of itself is sufficient to defeat all views cochrane and san martin may have on the country except as before a little plunder on the open and defenceless parts of the coast letters from sierra leone dated the th of nov mention that the whole squadron was lying there—the pheasant myrmidon snapper and thistle were lying off the cape waiting for the morgiana to complete her water provisions &c which ship was obliged to be assisted by the squadron in consequence of her very sickly state she had recently arrived from the river gambia whither she had proceeded in dread of attack by the natives on our infant colony there a letter of thanks had been voted to captain finlason by the merchants of that colony for the very able manner in which he brought to an amicable conclusion the differences between the native chiefs and the british interests in the gambia the morgania brought from the gambia dr dochard and fortysix men

adopted by the french government to prevent slave trading are now in a course of execution the french brig of war le huron of guns commodore du pressit is employed in cruizing for that purpose earthquake at zante jan —the last week has been a scene of horror and destruction at zante—at four o'clock on the morning of the th of dec we had a violent shock of an earthquake which lasted nearly half a minute this was followed by eight other shocks between four and six o'clock which threw down one thousand three hundred houses providentially the first shock did not throw down many so that the inhabitants had time to escape before succeeding shocks otherwise theloss would have been dreadful only ten lives have been lost but not a house in the town has escaped without some injury the town is still in a complete state of confusion one thousand give hundred houses more being so much injured as to be marked in order to be pulled down all the steeples in the place must be taken down the streets are almost impassable from the fallen houses and great caution is required in walking to avoid the ruins that are still falling emigration to canada the following is an extract of a letter from a tradesman belonging to glasgow who has been six years in upper canada to a friend in this city — york upper canada th november you wish to be informed of the encouragement that you might meet with by an emigration to this country and as you have determined to place the most implicit confidence in what i may advance i shall therefore state to you the truth and nothing but tl[] truth so help me god—in the first place you wish to know what might be the value of a hundred acres of land with six or eight acres of improvement this is a question that i cannot give a decided answer to as it depends entirely on the situation where you wish to purchase but i may with safety average wild land in this upper province say at to dollars per acre and the clearing or improving of each acre will cost you from to dollars—in the next place you wish to know the price of cattle they have never been known to be cheaper than at the present time a cow can be purchased at dollars a pair of working oxen at dollars a good cart horse at dollars sheep dollars apiece in regard to farming utensils there are but few used in this country at any time and a new settler may be some years in the woods before we want any more than an axe dollars a plough dollars and a harrow dollars—you wish to know the nature of a government grant that has now become no object as the charges made by government exceed in many cases what you can purchase land for and by buying land you have the advantage of choosing a situation agreeable to your mind but the reverse is the case when you accept of a grant from government for you must then take your chance by drawing by lottery and as the land is already taken up for forty miles round this place you will then be obliged to go back into the woods and out of the world you are at liberty to sell it as soon as you receive the grant formerly you could—you wish to know what sum you could establish yourself for in this country as a farmer there is one thing obvious—the more you bring the less miseries and difficulties you will have to undergo but as a true friend i would advise you not to think of leaving home with a sum less than t sterling with a sum less than this you undoubtedly subject yourself to hardships and troubles that you have no idea of though many have settled here for nothing their fate has been such that it is beyond my pend to describe and my greatest enemy i should not advise to come to this country with the intention of farming with less capital than i have no stated to you many may flatter you and stuff your head with golden dreams about this country but you must allow the experience that i have had to outweigh the statements of many that you may have had an opportunity of talking with who may pretend to have some knowledge of this country for there are but few settlements between montreal and the falls of niagara a distance of nearly miles that i have not visited—as to the necessaries wanted for a family who may think of coming to this country i should entirely confine myself to wearing apparel as clothes are the highest article in this country and should you think of farming i would advise you to bring but few fine clothes but principally coarse and stout heavy luggage of any kind becomes very expensive and cumbersome bringing you up the river so far as this and is often liable to be damaged in consequence of the repeated reshipping the rate of charge of the transportation of good from montreal to kingston miles is dollars per cwt and from kingston to york miles they charge dollar for each barrel bulk and from montreal to york you may get a passage for dollars for each grown person—by the by you wish to know the population of this town it is indeed small in comparison to some of your towns but i might say that the inhabitants of york might amount to people but there is no place that i have visited in my travels that is more thriving than this town and as a proof i can safely say that it is now twice the size that it was when i came here now three years and still continuing to increase greatly in buildings but all wood—you wish to know the different branches of business carried on here they are principally house carpenters and various other mechanics are also employed here—you wish to know if any of the emigrants have arrived in this place there are but very few i understand come thus far the greater part of them having stopped at a settlement called perth about miles below kingston —since i have now given answers to all your different queries let me now give my candid opinion respecting this country in the first instance a farmer may live by hard labour that is he may acquire a livelihood but cash[] is a complete hidden treasure and is as forbidden fruit to the farmer of this country and in some places you may live for years and not even behold a silver dollar through a glass darkly as all is done by barter in the country the next evil is the mixture of society a very few good intermixed with a multitude of a very different character but in many places you will be divested of all society either of a good or bad quality in either of which situations i am afraid you will find yourself uncomfortable in consequence of its being so much different to what you have been accustomed to and the opportunity of spending the sabbath in a religious worship you will also find wanting and above all evils the fever and ague that none escape is the ruin of many a family in this country but should you think of coming to this country in order to avoid this disease i would advise you to come no farther up the country than perth settlement where this loathsome sickness is seldom known now my friend by what i have stated here i neither mean to advise or dissuade you from coming to this country but take it into serious consideration before you embark upon this important canada provincial parliament of lower canada quebec legislative council—march this day his excellency the governor in chief made the following[] speech to both houses— gentlemen of the legislative council and gentlemen of the house of assembly when the parliament met for the dispatch of public business[] i did entertain a hope that the experience of the [] few years would have led you to a mature and serious consideration[] of the consequences that would inevitably follow[] if the then state of things should not be remedied i[] cannot therefore be surprised that i should now express[] not only my disappointment but great concern that [] same question of constitutional principle should have []ia disturbed the unanimity of your legislative proceedings[] upon this occasion i think it a duty which i owe to [] and to your country to call upon you to consider during[] this summer the result of the discussions of the sessesion[] in all its bearings you will see the administration of the civil government[] left without any pecuniary means but what i shall advance[] upon my own personal responsibility you will [] individuals suffering under severe and unmerited hardships[] caused by the wast of that constitutional authority that[] is necessary for the payment of the expences of the civil[] government you will see the interior improvements[] of the country nearly at a stand you will see in []ort the executive government in a manner palsied and powerless[] when i shall again summon you to meet here in parliament[] you will come to decide the important question whether[] the government shall be restored to its constitutional[[ energy or whether you are to deplore the prospect [] lasting misfortune by a continuance in the present state [] things important as that question is there can be no difficulty[[ in the decision when the blessingsof the british[] constitution were granted to this province you re[]ved with it the recorded experience of centuries of []ctise there is no question of doubt or of difficulty []that may not find its precedent in the records of the im[]imperial parliament and i cannot thik that any wiser []guide need by desired after which the honourable speaker of the legislative []council said that it was the pleasure of his excellency the []governor in chief that the provincial parliament should [] prorogued until thursday the th of april next we have received letters this morning from new south

the duties imposed in british ports on lumber from canada and third related to the losses sustained by the people of canada during the late war his excellency the governor had intimated that no objection would be made to the repeal of the grant of l on account of the civil list for the colony provided the salaray of the chief retired justice the receivergeneral and that of the speaker of the

montreal dated may states that a messenger was leaving that place to announce the union of the north and hudson's bay companies at their respective establishments the former of these companies was under control of lord selkirk and the schism that has so long reigned between them with its fatal consequences is well know to the public by letters from bombay we learn that ships have been taken up by the vigilant governor on board of which troops are embarked destined to the persian gulph to repair the disaster suffered by the surprise of the detachment left by sir wm kier under the direction of a young man the gallant gen lionel smith has been selected for this important service and we have no doubt but that he will convince the arabs of the impolicy of their treacherous proceedings and justify the high confidence which the government of bombay have in his talents and valour—his excellency mr elphinstone completely recovered is gone on a tour to kutch to settle all disputes and to ascertain the true situation of the country—how important it is for the heads of the presidencies thus to judge from actual observation instead of trusting to mere reports this proves the benefits of appointing men of experience and energy in the conduct of our indian empire—which is now throuh the admirable conduct of the governor general and the two other presidencies in a state of unexampled tranquility and prosperity van dieman's land we have been favoured with the following extract of a letter from captain dixon of the ship skelton dated hobert town van dieman's land th november — we

are truly surprising a plan is now forming for example to establish a settlement at the mouth of the river columbia for the purpose of importing teas direct from the east indies it is then proposed to transport this article of merchandize up the columbia until it reaches the rocky mountains and then to proceed by land to the navigable branch of the missouri this embraces a space of three hundred

the varied changes of commerse the atlantic states have heretofore been the medium of supplying our western states with the productions of china but if this plan should be carried into effect we may receive our supply from that country through the western states may it is worthy of remark that among the numerous arrivals at this port yesterday were three british brigs from dundee this makes good

under our protection had been cruelly murdered by a chief of the fantes[] at a place about six miles from cape coast called moree[] i was immediately ordered to assemble all the soldiers i could in five minutes and proceed to moree to seize the murderer i quickly set off with four officers and soliders a little before we entered the town of moree where the savages between and in number were assembled we saw the mangled remains of their unforunate victim the town stands near the top of a hill on the summit of which is an old dutch fort as soon as we entered the town a fire was opened upon us but as my orders were to seize the murderer if possible without bloodshed i did not for some time allow the men to return the fire however perceiving they were resolved to oppose us i gave directions to my little party to give them a volley and then to charge the negroes retired as we advanced and in less than an hour we gained the hill from which our opponents fled in every firection we demanded the keys of the fort from the principal man belonging to moree who not being engaged in the affair had remained and who immediately gave them up in the fort which has a drawbridge we were perfectly secure from the attack of the negroes the body we defeated were fantees who were assembled to assist the ashantees in enforcing some very unjust demands made by them on the people of cape coast as soon as the ashantees who reside near cape coast learned that the governor had sent an armed force against their friends their drum beat to arms and they hastened after us fortunately we had defeated our opponents before they arrived however they rallied the fantees and took a position about half a mile from the town with a determination to oppose our little party the governor apprised of our situation assembled all the forces he could muster and speedily about of the cape coast people headed by our officers and carrying the british flag were seen approaching the enemy immediatel retired and we were relieved from our disagreeable situation after having been from nine in the morning till four in the afternoon exposed to a burning sun without refreshment the negroes had killed and upwards of wounded in this affair we had one soldier killed and four wounded since the affair we have not seen one of the ashantees or the fantees here and a total stoppage of trade has taken

after a five months' tour to the northward he must minutely examined all the judicial and revenue systems—furnishing the collectors and agents of government with particular instructions for their

of boelekom[] ba was much damaged that of bontain less so on the th of january this year there was another shock of an earthquake but we do not learn that it did any damage it is with much regret we lay before our readers the following details of a most calamitous fire which broke out at halifax nova scotia on the th ult halifax sept the conflagration this morning was one of the most awful and destructive every witness in halifax it originated in sackvillestreet in the bakery occupied by shay and milany and before it was discovered had gained an alarming height it was near two o'clock when the bells were rung the troops seamean of his majesty's ships and inhabitants soon assembled the engines were judiciously placed lines formed to different reservoirs of water and every exertion made to extinguish the fire but we regret to state that before any check could be given to it the whole block of buildings with the exception of a house situated at the corner of sackville and blowers'streets occupied by mr h croskill the houses occupied by mrs neilson and mr t muirhead on barringtonstreet and a stable belonging to j w johnston esq in granvillestreet were consumed for some time great apprehensions were entertaintained that the fire would extend to the houses on the opposite side of the streets but fortunately it did not of the property burnt only about t were insured and the calamity has mostly fallen where it will long be severely felt—upon windows and orphan children—upon industrious tradesmen whose whole stock of worldly wealth was invested in the tenements they occupied to the troops and the seamen of the ships of war the town is as usual greatly indebted for the exertions made by them twentyone houses were consumed with other valuable property america appears to be very unhealthy just now—the accounts from long island baltimore amelia island and norfolk are extremely calamitous the whole of amelia island is a perfect hospital not one family being

franklin gazette that the malignant fever continues to make serious ravages among our fellow citizens at baltimore four full victims to it in the hours ending on sunday morning and six during the hours ending monday morning colonial intelligence in our last paper we gave from the jamaiza gazettes an account of the dreadful drought which had prevailed in that island for more than twelve months and the consequences of which had been most calamitous we are now however most happy in being able to state upon the authority of a gentleman who left jamaica some days subsequently to the date of our preceding advices that this terible evil in such a climate particularly had at length ceased the following is the substance of the information which has been communicated to us— a few hours previous to my going on board the jamaica packet on the d of september the rain fell in such torrents as to flood the streets of kingston to the depth of two feet and it seemed to be general throughout the district of liguanea though too late to save the crop of sugar for the present or perhaps the ensuing year this seasonable change of weather would at least have the effect of staying the mortality among the cattle as such those interested in the island will receive the intelligence with gratification on some properties the canes had been cut as fodder to save the stock we have the cape of good hope papers to the th august and as they are unusually barren in their contents it is fair to infer that every thing was proceeding there in a satisfactory manner the only article of the slightest

publishes accounts from java to the th may they confirm the statement of the decrease of the malady and mention that it was almost wholly subdued in the district of samarang but that persons mostly europeans had fallen victims batavia and sourabaya were still infected india—extract of a letter from calcutta dated june — if the extension of foreign trading be considered with you as a means suited to alleviate the pressure and ease the difficulties of old england which we read of here we imagine that india can furnish beneficial openings to this kind of remedy the use of articles of british production and exports is gaining ground rapidly here the english printed cottons are now carried in considerable quantities as far as rajpootha and find a ready sale if they be of handsome patterns the warehouses now are so far from being overstocked that before the arrival of two vessels from england in the last fortnight all european articles were exorbitantly high mustard flour sold about s a pound cheese [] ham three half crowns the ld a common round hat three guineas these undoubtedly were prices arising from an unusual scarcity but it surely cannot be so very bad a trading which admits even indicidentally of such an exaggeration of price and profit government bonds are now at six per cent premium though they bear but half the usual or legal interest of the country this is a tolerable evidence of the credit of the company and the government there is a great and increasing prosperity in hindostan the augmented cultivation of the upper provinces within these two years is surprising emigration the following is an extract of a letter dated louisville august th from a scotchman who has been long settled in america to his friend a scotch farmer who rents acres of land in the county of middlesex the circumstances in which this country is placed at present are truly melancholy when compared to what they have been yet still it is a better country to live in than britain it is not easy to make money by farming at present in the united states for the want of a market and i am of opinion that things will not mend in this respect for some years for all are sellers and none buyers all kinds of produce are selling or rather offered for sale at onethird of what prices were two years ago land of course has fallen in the same ratio the best of cleared land within from to miles of this town is offered for them from to dollars an acre you will thence conclude that this is a favourable time to purchase — and that for a man who has a little money and a large family able and willing to labour with their hands this is a most excellent country as he can easily raise on this cheap land all the necessaries and many of the luxuries of life he will find it difficult to get gold or silver or even our own bad bank notes but a man cannot be badly off with more beef mutton pork and grain than he can dispose of he has no rent to make up by term day his taxes are next to nothing and although he may grumble to have to turn his pigs into his corn field to save the expense of reaping it or to see his apples rotting under his trees by barnfulls because he has not room or use for them yet still these are beatable distresses compared to those of the poor farmers in our native land and as i suppose in england to the wealthier farmer the change is not beneficial or desirable it is true that if he stays long in britain he will soon become less wealthy yet still he would for some time regret the change he would miss many things made necessary by habit he would find his servants more lazy and less obedient and he would even experience pain because the modes of farming he is accustomed to will not do here but when he gets over these things he will find the advantage of the change to say nothing of the difference of the government and the satisfaction of chusing one's own rulers there are many desirable things here i estimate as the greatest the ease of providing for one's family a man may with very little exertion leave to all his children land enough to make them independent hence that sickening anxiety about the future fate of a family is little known here south america extract of a letter from an englishman dated lima september lima is what an englishman would call a dirty colonial town inhabitants is the outside of its population the whites are about europeans and not as many born in the country the rest are blacks and mulattoes of the mulattoes there are eight various shades i never saw such a wretched herd as lima incloses more poverty and miserty than in any town of the size in the world—there are some few splendid houses but the rest so disgustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin the

increase the evil thin clothing and vegetable diet—nights very cold —i sleep under a heavy blanket and could bear another a thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter the heat however is not excessive during summer on the whole not an oppressive climate if the people had any idea of living in a rational way very few families cook at home—they buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets in pulperias and in the squares not six families in lima that have wine on their tables they drink brandy at all hours and excuse themselves for not having any thing that is expensive by saying it gives the ague the same person who denies himself a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in the evening their money goes in gambling debauchery and dress every woman high and low has her price a lady take no offence at her frailty being exposed she tells you she is quite as good as her neighbours and needs be no better the spanish nation and government are the cause of all the degradation of south america every viceroy from pizarro to pezuela was a plunderer a teacher of immorality in words and deeds the miserable state of this people seems incredible—one must see to believe it scarcely a young lady can read or write or use a needle few houses that the devil has not appeared in and a devout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the virgin mary thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves as to priestcraft it reigns here in all its glory a third part of lima is covered with churches some of them very splendid the whole trade of this part of peru depends on the single mine of the mountain of pasco for returns if this is worked to advantage it will produce six millions of produce mining may be carried to any extent it is true but this requires tranquility and good government people in europe have the most erroneous ideas of peru every traveller and historian who has written or talked about it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar arica the

pretty country houses provisions of all sorts excellent and in the greatest variety fruits of all climates in the marketplace the produce of the seashore and the cordillera—beef and mutton

consists in the formation of two regiments the th and th infantry and in the intended raising of four others but which will not be embodied for some time if we look at the previous strength of the

gibraltar mediterranean &c cape of good hope } ceylon } mauritius } new south wales } prison discipline the fifth report of the committee of the society for the improvement of prison discipline &c— with an appendix &c t his report only reached us yesterday but the society brings so much benevolence into activity under the guidance of practical wisdom aided by very enlightened views of the best interests of society that we consider any delay improper in calling the attention of the public to their valuable proceedings the present report abounds with evidence that they have not relaxed in their exertions at home not only are the laws improving but the magistracy are carrying improvements into all the practical departments a great many jails designed on much better principlpes are in progress in different parts of the country and in those which are used it may be said generally that much more attentions is paid to health cleanliness diet employment and classification it must not be thought however that nothing remains to be done there are still jails in which prisoners are double ironed and chained to the floor of their cels from night to morning others in which persons committed for trial are fettered with irons of the weight of from seven to nine pounds and others in which debtors are exposed to the contaminating society of criminals in which neither the various classes of prisoners nor the two sexes are kept separate from each other and in which all are allowed to be idle the magistrates of surrey have provided a covered vehicle for conveying prisoners to the sessions'house but in the metropolis it would appear the practise still continues of inflicting public degradation on parties arraigned or merely suspected of crime by marching them handcuffed through the streets of london and very recently a party of one hun dred prisoners were marched for a mile handcuffed through the open streets in order to be formally set at liber ty by proclamation so much for metropolitan decorum these shameful exhibitions and practises cannot however long maintain their ground the publicity given to them through the proceedings of the society should of itself be enough to do them away but while they are continued england should be somewhat chary of her boasts the views and principles of the prison society are attracting notice and gaining ground in france switzerland the netherlands hanover bavaria wurtemberg denmark norway sweden and russia at christiana the magistrates have already resolved on the erection of a new city gaol in st petersburgh the prisoners are now furnished with food clothing baths and medical assistance a ladies' association under the patronage of the princess mesthersky is also in full activity at st petersburgh and there is an auxiliary prison society at orel on the very frontiers of siberia seven thousand prisoners passed through orel last year but their chains have been lightened and their condition meliorated generally through the exertions of the russian society for details however we must refer to the report itself but we cannot take leave of it without making special notice of the benefits conferred on society by the female associations and temporary refuge the almost miraculous power of kindness when accompanied as genuine kindness often is with quiet feeling and unobtrusive goodness continues to be exemplified in the ladies' committee of which mrs fry we believe is still at the head in newgate idleness dissipation and licentiousness have been succeeded by industry order and restraint and the same committee accomplish much good by visiting the ships in which convicts are embarked for new south wales arrangements are thus made for the formation of schools for moral and religious instruction during the voyage and the convicts are furnished not only with suitable clothing and other necessaries but the means of employment in the manufacture of such articles as may be readily sold for their relief on arriving at the colony these are truly good works and too much praise cannot be bestowed on the ladies by whom they are performed it is gratifying to observe that female associations for visiting prisons have been established in bedford bristol carlisle colchester derby dumfries durham exeter lancaster nottingham plymouth york and glasgow we had once thought that by this time we might have added edinburgh and we are inclined to hope that the present lord provost will yet employ his influence in establishing a lady's society for the prisons of our metropolis—there too we had cherished and still cherish the hope of seeing a house of refuge the temporary refuge of the prison society is chiefly for affording relief to distressed boys who on their discharge from the prisons of the metropolis have expressed a desire to abandon their criminal courses many of these are in circumstances of urgent want and the committee can now look round wtih pleasure on many who are variously settled and conducting them selves exemplarily in the temporary refuge they are trained up to habits of industry instructed in moral and religious duty and after a time are provided with suitable situations there is a great similarity in the histories of the individuals admitted into this asylum but the greater number obviously consists of boys who had been almost driven to commit petty thefts from want of employment or destitution or who from neglect or loss of parents had fallen into the company of professed thieves the committee mention that on one recent occasion no less than eight boys were released from newgate in one day and immediately after they had undergone the sentence of flogging which upon some insane rule is usually carried into effect on the day of their discharge their persons are thus marked with the stigma of guilt and from soreness and want of strength they are disabled from working at the very time they ought to go in search of employment no more effectual plan could have been devised to irritate these boys against society to prevent them from obtaining employment though desirous of it or to impel them to recommence their career of crime we entreat those who are inclined to look upon what they call a smart whipping as the only corrective for juvenile offences to reflect a little on the consequences to which their system inevitably tends we are decidedly and in all cases against the deliberate infliction of pain merely to be felt as such in the case of children if not necessary for that purpose it will certainly give them the idea of power superior to their own and may thus be the means of constraining more readily than otherwise but the law when it inflicts pain has always other means of evincing its power and constraining those who are within its grasp its most important function is to prevent crime its next is o convince those who comit offences that the means of detection are on the whole so sure that nothing is to be gained by the commission and its next to make restitution onerous and complete there may also be some classes of criminals who ought to be considered and treated as mad—some are curable and some as incurably furious who must either be cut off altogether or confined for life we are not opposed to the infliction of punishments because in our opinion the most effectual of those will be found to consist in the best means of preventing or remedying the evils produced by crime all exposures restraints constraints and compulsory reparations are punishments we are only hostile to the infliction of pain for no other purpose but because pain is produced if it can be made obvious to the sufferers that the pain inflicted protects others or affords true reparation for the wrongs done to them or society we shall then grant that such punishments may be both just and expedient the prison society while they vindicate themselves temperately but firmly from the charge of having yielded to a sort of blind and irrational benevolence and advocated measures which went to raise the condition of prisoners above that of common labourers do still seem to us to have been too much moved by the coarse jokes and reckless speculations of a clever essayist if they err at all they seem now to be somewhat too indulgent to the advocates of hard labour and severe punishments we are rather inclined to think them too decidely in favour of the tread mill which they allow has been so worked or constructed at different places as to form very unequal measures of punishment and they very properly insist that every treadmill should be provided with a regulator by which its rate of revolution may at all times be restrained within safe limits and a dialregister lately invented by mr bate instrumentmaker to the board of excise by which the rate of labour may be at any time accurately ascertained and which they think should in no case exceed feet in ascent for one day there is an able argument in the report against compelling persons to labour who are merely imrpisoned for trial and there is a great mass of curious and useful information in the appendix total charge t in january there were in the

property to serve as juries contains no regulations for the more impartial striking of juries or returning or making up of those who are to serve on each jury there does seem to be an improvement on the form of the returns to be made by the constables to the sheriffs scottish intelligence repeated instances have lately occurred in whcih dwellinghouses have suffered damage by fire owing to the carelessnes of servants and others who by way of economy take off fires at night and put the burning coals under the grate not recollecting that in the construction of almost every house the stone placed under the grate is supported by timber separated from the hearth stone by some lime only the wood underneath being once ignited the fire will rapidly spread and may in a few hours involve the whole tenement in flames emigration to australia—we understand that the establishment of an australian company has suggested to a number of public spirited individuals the idea of forming a society to aid deserving persons in their endeavours to emigrate and settle in new south wales and van dieman's land and that matters are actually in progress for carrying this benevolent project into effect on wednesday a meeting was held in the freemasons' hall niddry street which was respectably attended the rev mr lothian in the chair when a series of resolutions were moved by william ellis esq s s c and seocnd by robert paul esq of the commercial bank the principal object comprehended in those were the security of the persons and property of emigrants on the voyage—the maintenance of a regular communication with friends left behind and the insuring a friendly welcome temporary accommodation and facilities for permanent settlement in the country of their adoption it was also proposed to give

winchester house of commons thursday may mr j smith presented a petition from the australian company which was founded for the purpose of cultivating lands in new south wales praying that they might be incorporated the petition was ordered to be referred to a committee mr secretary peel in moving the commitment of the transportation bill stated that the objects of the bill were first to continue the laws on transportation that would expire before the next session and next to cimplify the law in the last session a bill had been passed to enable the crown to make an experiment of the union of the hulk and transportation system by sending convicts to bermuda there had been as yet hardly time to decide fully on the experiment but as far as it could be judged of it was satisfactory it had been hithero complained that transportation was a very esqual punishment and certainly there was a great different in the effect of the punishment upon a man of settled habits and with a family and upon a man of no fixed habits to whom as hitherto managed it had scarcely been a punishment he wished it to be known that arrangements had been made in new south wales to send some of the convicts to a distant part of the settlement where the punishment would be more severe a selection would be made from the convicts so as to make the punishment efficient against those to whom it had hitherto had no terror—he gave this statement because it was right the public should know that transportation would be henceforward a real punishment press at cape of good hope mr greig after stating the correspondence which took place between him and the fiscal which led to the suppression of his journal gives the following account of his interview with that functionary on monday evening the fiscal sent a messenger to me requesting i would call at his house in strandstreet i did so he then opened a conversation upon the subject of my paper the south african commercial advertiser and said he was instructed to inform me that i had departed from the prospectus —that it was become obnoxious to the government and referred more particularly to the last three or four numbers i asked him to point out such parts as were immediately objectionable he then mentioned some leading remarks which he said bore upon the administration of the colony he further pointed out as ob noxious all quotations which had been made from de lolne[] blackstone and civil servant'swork lacon and generally all extracts relative to the liberty of the press observing — nobody can doubt the obvious tendency of these and as we are not men in this colony but merely infants it was in his opinion dangerous to insert such matter he added also that it was expected i should in future publish no parts of trials but wait until the whole were finished and even then all scurrilous parts such as the memorial of mr l cooke to the treasury were to be omitted that i was further to bound down with two sureties in the penalty of ten thousand rixdollars that nothing of the offensive nature pointed out should appear in any future number and lastly that i was to take particular care that the next number contained no matter of the description alluded to nor any notice of mr edward's trial to all this i replied that i would give no promise as to what would appear in the next or any future number that i required time to consider what was fitting to be done with regard to the security demanded the morning chronicle makes the following remarks on this case — we cannot say that we are surprised that acts of this description should take place in our colonies uncontrouled power produces every day in europe the worst effects on men of the best dispositions and the best talents and the governors of our conquered colonies and new south wales are unfortunately quite absolute in europe the people under absolute governments have this advantage over the people in our colonies that men in office are generally selected with some reference to abilities and acquirements but with the exception of the east indies the gonernment of which with all its faults generally we believe avails itself of talents our colonies are unfortunately considered as mere places of refuge for the relatives of our aristocracy of whom nothing can be made in this country this is what constitutes fitness for a colonial office and so far from being astonished at the disgraceful scenes which are constantly taking place in the colonies every person capable of reflecting at all upon the matter would be astonished were he to find common abilities the holder of a colonial appointment of any value of lord charles somerset the less that is said the better in fact nothing is more wanted than the perusal of a cape of good hope almanack to satisfy the british public what sort of personage he is would it be believe that in a country of boundless extent with only a settlement here and there where the greatest enemies the colonists have to contend with are the wild animals it could possible enter in to the head of any rarional being to introduce laws for the preservation of game one would as soon expect to hear laws in turkey for the preservation of the plague yet it so happens that a code which would do credit to sir john shelley himself guarding against the possible disinction of the game of africa occupies a goodly space in the cape almanack after such a specimen of wisdom all criticism on this personage would be thrown away london saturday february hunt—since the arrival of hunt on board the justitia

its enjoyment even in their perilous plight o'er a' the ills o' life victorious but alas the course of true love never did run smooth and no less a personage than the secretary of state for the home

solitary way—fife hld house of commons—june the speaker took the chair at a few minutes before four o'clock and was shortly afterwards summoned by the deputy usher of the black rod to attend the house of lords the speaker stated on his return that the royal assent had been given by commission to several public and private bills mr c dundas presented a petition from newbury in the county of berks praying for the abolition of slavery in the west indies mr planta moved for a new writ for the election of a member to serve in parliament in the room of lord leveson gower who had accepted the office of chiefsecretary for ireland—ordered alehouse licensing bill on the motion of mr estcourt the house resolved itself into a committee on this bill on the clause that no brewer who should himself supply public houses with beer should be allowed to act or assist as a magistrate at any meeting or session for the granting of licenses mr bernal moved that this clause be struck out altogether mr r gordon supported the clause mr monck thought this the most valuable clause in the bill and that it was no infringemnt but a salutary interference with the jurisdiction of borough magistrates strangers were ordered to withdraw and the committee divided when there were—ayes —noes —majority against the clause several amendments verbal and otherwise were then agreed to amongst which was the omission of the words cinque ports thus excluding that class of places from the operation of the bill on the clause being proposed relative to the hours during which public houses should be kept open on sundays mr estcourt said the original clause was to the effect that publichouses should be closed during the hours of morning and afternoon's divine service but he thought it would be better not to permit publicans to allow drinking or tippling on their premises till after the usual hour of the conclusion of morning service one o'clock after a conversation in which several hon members participated the clause was agreed to several other clauses having been then read and agreed to the house resumed the report was brought up ordered to be taken into further consideration on monday next and printed the usury laws mr p thompson moved the second reading of the usury laws amendment bill mr davenport said he should oppose the bill as he considered it to be highly injurious both to the landed and commercial interests the hon members moved an amendment that the bill be read a second time that day three months the question on th amendment having been put the chancellor of the exchequer suggested the propriety of postponing this bill until the next session of parliament he made this suggestion from no unfriendly feeling towards the bill but merely because this was not he conceived the most convenient time to consider it the subject ought to be fully considered with a view to get rid of evils that existed without interfering with longcontinued prejudices if the discussion were postponed he would give the subject the best attention in his hear mr heathcote approved of the suggestion of the right hon gentleman and wished the discussion on the question to be postponed till the next session of parliament mr l foster thought that between the total repeal or the continued existence of the usury laws in their present shape a middle course might be steered of the bill before the house he thought that under the guise of a simple enactment it covered one of the greatest illusion ever held forth to parliament or the country for he was convinced that it would effect as complete and as practicable a repeal of the usury laws as could be proposed it became necessary therefore to consider the probable operation of that repeal upon all the great interest of the country the bill might give relief to few but would bring injury to many lord palmerston thought the house indebted to the hon member for dover for bringing in the bill it might be possible to form a bill better than that of the hon member but his bill was better than the present law and as such he should vote for it the gallery was then cleared and the house divided when there appeared for the second reading—ayes noes majority in favour of the second reading voters' registration bill lord nugent moved the second reading of the voters' registration bill and said that his object in carrying it through the present stage was that the bill might be committed pro forma for the purpose of having certain amendment introduced into it it would then be printed with its amendments in order that the house and the country might have the opportunity of considering its details between this and the next session of parliament sir r wilson moved as an amendment that the bill might be read a second time that day six months mr h gurney seconded the amendment the question was then put on the amendment which was agreed to and the bill was ordered to be read a second time this day six months salmon fisheries preservation bill on the motion of the chancellor of exche quer the house resolved itself into a committee on the salmon fisheries preservation bill mr ferguson proposed the insertion of a clause exempting from the operation of the bill the salmon fisheries in the river and bay of thurso in the county of caithness which are the exclusive property of sir john sinclair after some conversation the gallery was cleared and the committee divided when the clause was lost the bill having passed through the committee the report was ordered to be received this day the other orders were then disposed of and the house adjourned at halfpast two o'clock friday june sir g murray took the oaths and his seat on his reelection for the county of perth a number of petitions were presented against the continuance of negreo slavery irish currency sir g hill presented a petition from the chamber of commerce of the city of londonderry praying that the bill for amending the laws relating to banks in ireland might not be allowed to make further progress for the present the petition was laid on the table sir a chichester presented a petition from belfast praying a reduction of the duty on coals in ireland which was laid upon the table scotch gaols' bill the lord advocate in moving that this bill be read a second time and printed observed that it was not his intention to press it further during the present session no man could however deny that the object of the bill was of great importance and he proposed therefore to have its provisions made generally known throughout the country in order that it might be again presented to the house in as perfect a shape as possible the bill was then read a second time and ordered to be printed committee of supply in the committee of supply a number of grants of minor importance were agreed to sir h hardinge said he had another resolution to propose but it was in which he expected that a reduction would be made next year it was that a sum of l s d be granted for the expenses of the disembodied[] militia of the united kingdom mr spring rice said that within the last twelve years there had been two millions and a half expended on this body and that the subject was one which few gentlemen took the trouble to look at he begged to say a word upon the irish militia there the whole of the staff which was larger than that of england was without a private man nothing could a more outrageous job than that of the milita in ireland the colonels kept the whole patronage of the regiment and kept up the bands for the amusemen of themselves and friends the militia might have been of service at one time in ireland but since that time the present effective police had been established and quite superseded it he trusted ministers would not suffer this to remain if they really wished to be economical and curtail if not abolish it the chancellor of the exchequer begged to assure his hon friend that he wanted no prompting to make any economical reduction when however a plan for the reduction of the staff was ready and it was in contemplation it would be laid before parliament and he should then be the friend of the definite and limited powers to which he had alluded mr hume said the militia had been defended as though the country were in hourly danger of invasion —as if the country could be taken by surprise if that were so he would gladly learn of what use were the spies who cost us l ayear we had ambassadors—they were very little better than spies—at an expense of layear and if their cautious observance were not sufficient to save the country from sudden invasion he knew no better means and he certainly knew no other advantage which ambassadors and consuls could be of new south wales bill—committee on the order of the day having been read for the house resolving itself into committee on the new south wales bill mr huskisson moved that the speaker do leave the chair sir j mackintosh said the object of his present motion of which he had previously given notice was to propose two instruction to the committee on the bill which the right hon gentleman mr huskisson had introduced—first to the effect that the committee should recommend the introduction of a clause for the establishment of a trial by jury in new south wales and van diemen's land and secondly that it should recommend that a clause be introduced providing for the election of onethird of the legislative council from among persons enjoying an income of l a year and having been free inhabitants of the colonies for the space[] of three years the best local authories in favour of his proposition among these he might mention the names of governor hunter governor bligh mr bent the judge advocate governor macquarrie and his successor sir thomas brisbane who had gone out to the colony prejudiced against the introduction into it of these institutions but after two years careful investigation of the subject wrote home in oct stating that there was now no longer any doubt about its perfect ripeness for them— hear hear—the partial introduction of english institutions into immediate practise was the only pledge of a real intention on the part of government to introduce them more completely in the end the right hon gent concluded by moving that instruction be given to the committee to recommend the introduction of trial by jury into the colony and to allow the inhabitants a voice in the legislative councils mr huskisson said in the bill which he had introduced it was intended to extend the privilege to the government of the country of granting trial by jury in all civil cases his right hon friend would find if he examined that the foundation would be laid of granting the inhabitants of that colony a share in managing their own concerns at present the legislature proposed by way of a first step to appoint a legislative committee for the purpose of watching and controuling every measure of the state all trials should be public under the inspection of a free press and a population jealous of their rights they should now be prepared in the course of a few years for the regular introduction of a legislative assembly not had he any fears when such a change should take place that it would lead to any political convulsion mr hume had every reason to believe that if instead of inflicting a military governemtn they would introduce a portion of representation and the privileges of british subjects into new south wales it would be the most flourishing of the colonies mr horace twiss said the knowledge of one fact might obviate the necessity for one at least of the right hon gent's propsitions namely that the governor of the colony had the power of extending to the colonists the right of trial by jury if he should deem it expedient sir james mackintosh here intimated that he should not press his amendments they were accordingly negatived the house then resolved itself into the committee when several verbal amendments were proposed and agreed to the bill then went through the committee and the report with the amendments was ordered to be brought up on monday the other orders of the day were then disposed of and the house adjourned at halfpast two o'clock bervic—there has been raised this season on the high lands of the farm of hallgreen belonging to mr blair a few acres of ribgrass a native plant of new south wales it was imported to this country two years ago by a man who had served his time in van dieman's land its[] favourite soil seems to be high land or muir country and is so rapid in growth that it appears not only to choke but to extirpate[] every weed with which it comes in contact it is said to be the best plant in the world both for feeding cattle and for producing mik from cows of the best and richest quality were the propiertors and tenants of the highland country to follow the enterprising conduct of mr blair we would soon see their hills covering with a truly useful plant instead of the useless heath with at present even at best only adorns them a vessel of tons burden has been taken up by government for the conveyance of the settlers to oyster harbour new south wales and the command given to lieut wm geary australia—we understand the celebrated navigator captain parry has been appointed the director of the australian agricultural company he proceeds to that colony immediately the salary is stated to be very handsome house of commons—june sir j mackintosh presented a petition from mr charles buck complaining that managers of theatres were allowed to perform dramatic pieces without the knowledge or leave of the writer and without any profit to him the hon member said that lord byron and mr millman had made similar complaints and that every person who had given that subject consideration admitted that literary property was not sufficiently protected in this country and that the decline of dramatic writing was to be attributed to the state of the law mr g lamb thought it a very serious grievance that if a man wrote a tragedy it might be taken by any manager and performed on the stage and the writer brought to the miserable condition of a damned author nolens volenns a laugh the decline of dramatic writing in this country was to be ascribed to the unprofitable nature of that description of writing as compared with other branches of literature and it would be very desirable if a dramatic author had power to sell his play like any other description of property and that no manager should perform it without paying the writer which was the system in france the petition was ordered to be printed birmingham petition mr brougham rose to present a petition from a very respectable body it had been agreed to at a numerous meeting of manufacturers artisans and other inhabitants of birmingham and was signed by persons without solicitation they contended that the distress which now prevailed not only had reference to that poorer classes of society but spread itself over the whole system of society this distress the petitioners ascribed to the tampering that had taken place with the currency their opinion was that too much stress was laid upon the panic which had taken place in for though it was true that a great number of failures had taken place among the bankers yet it was no less true that of about bankers who had failed as many as [] had subsequently paid s in the pound if such were the case he was very glad to hear it the opinion of the petitioners rather was that the present distress arose from the speculations and overtrading which had taken place and that such might have been the case topitally[] there could be no manner of doubt that a great deal of the distress of the nation had arisen from the depreciation of the currency by which people were now paying taxes at a rate that had never been intended when they were originally imposed was extremely likely but whether it operated to the extent that the petitioners described was another question in the year he had been one of those who had resisted the imposition of new taxes because he thought that that was the very worst time that ministers could have chosen for such an object his opinion however had been overruled and the taxes had been increased that the effect of this must be to cripple the industry of the country no man could doubt and what he wished was to see a remedy for t but the misfortune was that after making every possible retrenchment—by reducing salaries and dealing in the best possible way with all the payments which the nation had to make—the dead weight would still remain round the neck of the country and press it down to the effectual injury of its best interests how were they to get over the millions of debt and the or millions of interest annually payable thereon in the latter part of the petition he entirely agreed and hoped that every thing would be done to give the people as great relief from the pressure of the taxes as might be consistent with a due regard to the public credit and the service of the state and so far from treating this remedy lightly the more he thought that the petitioners were wrong in their observations on the tampering of the currency the more he was inclined to listen to that part of the petition which appeared to him to be founded on truth mr bennett was of opinion that the forced restoration of a metallic currency was one of the principal causes of the present distress the taxes were now paid in money and it now required twice the produce to pay them which it did before the year that was nothing less than a robbery but how it was to be remedied he really was at a loss to know he would never break faith with the public creditor and the only means to pay off our public debt would be to impose an income tax if the public debt were once removed then free trade could take place in every branch of trade but not till then such was the opinion of his late friend mr ricardo and sooner or later he thought some such measure would be resorted to mr alderman waitham observed that it was strange that while the public distress was admitted to be extreme no effort was made to reduce the public expenditure he was ready to prove that the export trade of the country had fallen off to the amount of from nearly nine to thirteen millions although he knew that in saying this he was encountering serious adversaries he did not underrate our export trade it was valuable but for a period of thirtyone years it had fallen off at the rate of six millions per annum and this could be shewn from parliamentary documents with respect to the petition now before the house he mainly agreed with its statements while at the same time he could never consent to any thing like a breach of faith with the public creditor mr w whitmore heard with astonishment that our foreign trade had greatly diminished the reverse being so notoriously the fact since there was certainly a fall in the value of our manufactures but so there was in the raw material and the vast increase of machinery should also be taken into account it was said that our exports had declined but facts would prove decidedly the reverse from to the exports were l from to l from to l from to l in l and in the amounts of exports rose to l—so much for the alleged decrease of our export trade as stated by the worthy alderman hear hear hear in [] the currency was in the greatest state of depreciation but he begged pardon for having said so much and he was induced to offer a word in order to counteract the danger which might arise if the statements of the worthy alderman remained unanswered mr sec peel observed that whenever any change however calculated to be ultimately beneficial was made in the system of our currency it must be attended in the first instance with considerable inconveniences the more he considered the subject the more was he convinced that the best interests of the nation required that we should strictly adhere to the law of our currency now established hear hear he hoped he should never see the time when the restrictions on cash payments should be renewed when however the petitioners declared it to be expedient to increase the amount of our currency by an issue of paper he would ask them what they would in that case do with the exchanges if the exchanges fell the gold would go out of the country what would they do they must renew the restriction on cash payments by the bank it was not any change in the value of the currency but the prosperity of manchester that had occasioned the depression in spitalfields in the number of factories in manchester were fiftyfour and they were assessed at the annual value of l in they were assessed at l in when the small notes bill passed the numbers were assessed at l in the year before the small notes bill took effect the numbers were and they were assessed at l the hon gentleman opposite had said that no fresh capital had been employed in this trade but that persons would work at a loss rather than let their machines stand idle but if this were the case it would not account for the erection of new factories the establishment of which was irreconcileable with the idea of general stagnation with respect to the silk trade in manchester in there were looms and in there were and there were between and looms working manufactured articles of silk mixed with cotton he had had a letter from manchester dated st of june upon which he could rely and it stated that all the silk weavers were or might be in active emply for the last ten years at manchester machinery had improved in powers of production in the ratio of per cent per annum few persons had attributed enough to the importation of labourers from ireland a greater number of irish labourers in the manufacturing districts were out of emply than people could imagine and the magistrates relieved them rather than pass them to their parishes reflecting that as they had contributed to the prosperity ot the places they had a right to relief when in distress where the passage was so low and this country possessed the advantage of a legal provision for the poor it was impossible to check the influx of irish labourers and this fact would suggest important alterations in the state of the law hear hear he felt convinced that any alterations with respect to the values of the currency would be attended with the greatest evils to every class mr w horton observed that some honourable gentleman considered the distress of our artisans and manufacturers to arise from the state of the currency but he mr horton was at a loss to see how the redundant labour at shipley could have been affected by the change of the currency another class were the antipodes of these—they imputed our distress to the corn laws but it was idle to talk of altering the corn laws we should look to practical remedies as long as a redundancy of labour existed in england which was aggravated by the condition of the irish who flocked to england and operated a still further prejudice to the labouring class of this country the distress would continue the remedy which he proposed for the evil he had pointed out was emigration in the manner proposed in the report of a committee of which he had the honour to be the chairman by parishes advancing a sum of money to locate pauper labourers in our north american colonies the right hon gentleman then read opinions in approbation of his plan from mr tooke mr malthus colonel torrens and others and observed that he had the opinion of the late mr ricardo to the same effect in a lette which had been published he then entered into a calculation to show the saving to parishes by this plan and he challenged any member of the house the show the fallacy of the calculations—there was however an answer so easy that it was constantly made— the vacuum would be filled up immediately this was a delicate subject to touch upon for he knew not how the vacuum could be filled up but by the introduction of young gentlemen and ladies a laugh but was it supposed that fifty labourers would be replaced immediately by fifty children or did these objectors suppose that labourers would be brought from russia or elsewhere the right honourable gentleman then adverted to the remarks in mr sadler's work wherein it was stated that is appeared from the official documents that the mortality amongst the emigrants to north america had been in the unprecedented proportion of in whereas in wales the proportion was in and in england in this he would assert was an incorrect statement so far from the proportion being in it was only in the same proportion which existed in carlisle the healthiest place in england the emigrants it should be recollected carried out children and the mortality amongst children was in the proportion of in and in london much greater for it had been ascertained that out of infants amongst the poor only survived the period of nursing the right hon gentleman concluded with reading his last resolution— that it is expedient that such measures should be adopted in the next session of parliament as may furnish the most safe and effectual means of producing the desird improvement by a judicious application of both these principles and at the same time under conditions which will prevent the probability of a recurrence of similar evils and also effect a material saving of the national income instead of producing an increased charge thereon mr huskisson contended that colonization ought to be encouraged had it not been for emigration this country could never have reached its present state of importance and prosperity nor would our language have been extended to the united states and been adopted in more distant countries if there were one circumstance more striking than another it was the prodigious increase of consumption a proof of the growing wealth and resources of the country in the year the exchange in trade was against us now it was in our favour this country would carry on its great affairs with as small a portion of metallic currency as possible but let them guard against a system which had led to depreciation of the currency and the panic which was felt in he had heard somewhere a metaphor respecting paper currency like a skyrocket it rose with splendour but lost its brightness and when its fire was extinguished it fell in darkness like the shaft of the rocket upon the heads of those who had raised it mr secretary peel said in consequence of the course of policy which he had deemed it advisable to adopt in the previous session a series of unfounded calumnies had been levelled at him which however he had despised too much to condescend to notice but there was one which as it reflected on his public and official character he would with permission of the house allude to on that occasion the report to which he alluded was that he had used his influence as secretary of state to procure an enormous grant of land for a relative of his hear hear hear in consequence of seeing this report in the public newspapers he had requested his right honourable friend to move in that house for the production of certain papers calculted to explain the whole matter those papers had in consequence been produced and were now printed he trusted however that the house would excuse him for again alluding to the subject hear hear hear he hoped that the consequence of those papers being printed would have been that some member would have asked some questions on the subject but though this was not the case he had received a communication which made him think that some one out of doors had been imposed upon by the calumny though no member of that house had been so deceived cheering he begged in the first place to state most distinctly that he had procured no grant of land for any brother of his hear a gentleman whose name was the same as his and who was his second cousin had had a grant made him by his right hon friend but in that grant he begged to state to the house upon his word of honour as a gentleman he had had no participation whatever hear with respect to the settlement on the swan river he was ashamed to say that he had neither heard nor knew of it till he received a letter from his cousin announcing to him that he had abandoned the idea of going to new south wales and that from the circumstances of mr twiss informing him that government would be disposed to afford assistance to any settlers going to the swan river he and three other gentlemen had been induced to send in a proposal to that effect with respect to the other calumnies which had been promulgated against him they rather went to private matters and he had therefore not condescended to notice them but as this one had reference to the public department in which he officiated he had thought it so far a public concern as to venture to ask the attention of the house while he trespassed on it to disclaim any participation in the grant that had been made hear sir geo murray—the house would probably think after the statement of his right honourable friend that it would be unnecessary for him to rise to address them hear he was satisfied that the house knew that his right hon friend was incapable of proposing anything that would come under the designation of what was vulgarly called a job hear adjournment mr secretary peel gave notice that he should tomorrow move the adjournment of the house to that day week the right hon gentleman at the same time presented a petition from the apothecaries company of london in favour as we understood of the bill regarding dissection mr wilmot horton rose to propose the resolutions of wich he had given notic relative to the state of the labouring poor the firt resolution having been put from the chair the chancellor of the exchequer moved as an amendment that the order of the day be now read mr bennett opposed the resolutions the amendement was agreed to without a division mr labouchere postponed until tomorrow his motion respecting canada slave trade mr otway cave moved the following resolutions resolved st that no human legislature has any lawful power to abridge or destroy the natural rights of life and liberty unless the owner shall himself commit some criminal act that amounts to a forfeiture d that although neither the government nor the legislature of the county have arrogated to themselves the power of destroying the natural rights of innocent british subjects or of delegating any such power to other authorities it is a notorious fact that in many british colonies lying remote from the immediate observation of the government innocent british born subjects are from the time of their birth robbed of their natural rights and converted into slaves that it is the especial duty of this house as the representatives of the people to take effectual measures for protecting all british subjects that shall be born henceforward in the west indian colonies from similar violations of their natural inherent and paramount rights as human beings the motion being seconded by mr lumley mr w smith said he could not give his support to these resolutions because they were connected with a question of too much importance to be agitated in such a manner and at such a period of the session mr huskisson was of opinion that resolutions of such a description as those brought forward by the hon member ought to be met by a direct negative strangers were then ordered to withdraw the resolutions were declared to be negatived without a division the other orders of the day were then disposed of and the house adjourned at halfpast one o'clock swan river—the fine ship gilmore purchased by mr t peel brother to the secretary of state for the home department proceeded down the

dance and murray lords fitzroy somerset rosslyn and thomas cecil lieut general sir w gordon quartermaster general sir george murray sir charles dance and a large number of military and scientific gentlemen his grace sir w gordon the ladies percy &c had a carriage attacked and rode round the yard with the greatest pleasure and satisfaction afterwards a waggon was fastened to the steam carriage containing soldiers besides mr gurney and two or three men on the engine and though the road was very disadvantageous being a rough loose sand and gravel it drew them round without the least diminuition of its speed between nine and ten miles an hour in these experiments mr gurney applied his steam generally but to one wheel in order to give the company full proof of the power and practicability of the invention having satisfied them as to this and as to its manageability by a variety of involutions and evolutions he gave them a specimen of its speed and drove seven or eight times round at the rate of or miles an hour it is difficult to say whether the company was more pleased or surprised at these unequivocal proofs of mr gurney's success the duke of wellington observed that it was scarcely possible to calculate the benefits we should derive from the introduction of such an invention as this the french papers of tuesday state that the emperor nicholas was preparing

the whole catalogue without discovering a handsome woman yet none have exceleed these writers in descriptions of female beauty the truth is that the contemplation of a bottle or peaked nose a wide mouth goggle eyes and a spare body causes an author to set out with more enthusiasm in search of the ideal of womanly perfections and affords the widest scope to the imagination nothing impedes the

portsmouth with prospects of favourable weather in her progress down the channel the warrior is a fine vessel of about tons burden and carried out upwards of passengers to the new settlement several

tempestuous weather may be anticipated on the vessel reaching the bay of biscay apprehensions are entertained that a portion of the live cargo must be consigned to the ocean before the termination of the voyage it is calculated that from the advantageous arrangements entered into by the commander and a gentleman named semple who has chartered the warrior and gone out in her they will clear the enormous sum of l by the voyage the king's health it will be seen from our private letter that unfavourable accounts respecting his majesty's health were circulating in london at o'clock on wednesday evening in our last we alluded to the suspicions which the nonappearance of bulletins for four days after the first gave rise to on monday a second bulletin appeared certainly not of a character to remove the public anxiety and this has been followed by two days' silence every one naturally puts the question if his majesty is better why not state this in a bulletin that the thousand discouraging rumours in circulation may be put to rest the morning chronicle says that the high officers of state are not much better informed on the subject than others and that a knowledge of his majesty's real condition is confined to the very few immediately around his person in the absence of correct information inferences are drawn from every passing circumstance it was observed that sir henry halford very shortly after his return from windsor on tuesday morning had a long interview with the duke of wellington and it has not escaped notice that his majesty's sister the duchess of gloucester had been sent for to visit him the globe says that according to reports which are circulated in high quarters his majesty's illness excites considerable alarm and that gout in the stomach is complicated with dropsical symptoms what credit may be due to these statements we cannot tell but whether they be true or false they furnish a reason for the publication of official intelligence the king's health is a matter which concerns the public deeply and all mystery and deception on the subject are most reprehensible we refer to our london head for a variety of articles upon the subject and if this night's mail bring any additional information of importance we shall publish it in a secoond edition the two houses of parliament meet again on monday we publish the address of the birmingham union to day and meant to accompany it with some remarks but have only time at present to express out regret that so masterly a paper dealing in great and immutable principles should have its value lessened by being so much mixed up with ephemeral matters and with false or questionable doctrines respecting currency the passion for emigrating to swan river has not received any check there are four ships now at london and as many more at other ports which are preparing to sail for the settlement with passengers indeed the numbers who are flying from the country at this moment who are we believe quite unprecedented within the last ten days we have seen notices of fifteen ships that were loading with emigrants at hull twelve at waterford and several at bristol liverpool and greenock all destined we think for the united states or british america the exportation of human beings from the british isles to different quarters of the world must now be proceeding at the rate of one or two thousand per week it will be remembered that according to reports from india received some time ago lord william bentick had issued an order abolishing those horrid human sacrifices the suttees doubts were thrown upon this intelligence when the subject was lately talked of in parliament but we are happy to say that its accuracy is confirmed by the arrival of the official document it is disgraceful to the british indian government that it has been hitherto either so callous that it overlooked this enormity or so ignorant of its own resources and the true state of the people under its authority as to believe that it had not power to effect its abolition the report of a revolution having taken place in chili is confirmed in letters from bogota the constitutional director pinto has been driven out of the capital by general prieto with an armed force and great excesses are said to have been committed a small fleet sailed lately from cadiz for havannah with soldiers on board the expedition is supposed by some to be intended for the invasion of mexico but it is more likely to find employment in keeping down the elements of insurrection in cuba—the plot to which we alluded in our last seems to have excited much alarm some of the most opulent families in the island with several lawyers and official persons were concerned in it their object was as we conjectured to convert the island into an independent republic from a detailed list published in the french papers it appears that the expedition against algiers is to be composed of men infantry cavalray and artillery farther intelligence has been received from the capital of colombia to the th of february a warm address had been presented by the congress to bolivar entreating him not to abandon the republic at a moment when its existence was menaced by conspiracies and he seems to have once more consented to remain in office commissioners had been appointed to proceed to valentia and endeavour to accomodate the differences between the people of venezuela and the central government by peaceable means if these failed it was determined to employ force the congress was in session at bogota and was proceeding to fulfil the object for which it had been assembled by drawing up a new constitution the bases are published and though the present only an imperfect sketch of its plan they disclose one or two features which seem to be characteristic the government is to be central as it has hitherto been not federal like that of the united states which has served as a model to mexico guatemala and la plata in the one case the supreme authority is vested in a single legislature which meets in the capital in the other it is divided among a number of local assemblies while the general congress representing the whole wields no other powers than what is necessary to hold the separate members in a state of union the federal system which leaves to every province the management of its own concerns has advantages for a settled and enlightened community but whether it is equally adapted to the circumstances of an ignorant people newly escaped from political convulsions is very questionable there seems however to be a partiality for the federal system in the new world and to humour this feeling the new constitution provides that chambers of districts shall be established with powers to decide on all municipal and local affairs the difficulty will be to give these bodies the powers necessary to develope the industry and resources of the country without permitting them to impose taxes and exercise other legislative functions which will interfere with the business of the general government another articl state that the members of the senate and house of representatives are to hold their seats for a considerable time in order to avoid the inconveniences resulting from frequent changes or the repeated election of the same person in the mouth of an english statesman we should consider this vile sophistry but allowance must be made for the res dur novitas regni in a new state like colombia formed of heterogenous elements among which it is not easy to establish any principle of cohesion one the same grouns the columbian legislators may be pardoned for resolving that the catholic religion is that of the state and that no other shall be permitted this is merely a concescession for the sake of peace to prejudice which the government is not strong enough to subdue and cannot defy without great danger nothing is said about the mode of election or the power of the president two points of vital consequence which may give a new complexion to the whole scheme we have made these remarks on the proposed constitution because it probably holds out the last chance of composing the trouble of columbia if it does not satisfy the people other provinces will soon follow the example of venezuela and all the address and influence of bolivar will not prevent the republic from splitting into four or five independent communities whose mutual jealousness and wars will crush the librties and destroy the prosperity of the whole private correspondence london wednesday evening the king's health we are sorry to state that the private accounts received from windsor this afternoon do not speak so favourably of his majesty's health as the court circular and most of the assertions of the papers published this afternoon there having however been no bulletin issued up to the present hour o'clock must swan river settlement—on the th inst the swedish ship sterling captain d e hogan with a swedish crew sailedfrom gottenburgh sept for the settlement in swan river among the cargo are eleven wooden houses built here and consisting of four to ten rooms which have been taken to pieces and

interesting addition to their beautiful panorama of botany bay algiers &c of several views illustrative of the principal events of the late revolution in paris and from the brilliant and effective style in which they are got up must draw the attention of the public in no ordinary manner the wool trade—london thursday night—this afternoon the first sale of wools for a long time past took place at garraway's coffeehouse the quantity announced for sale today was nearly bales consisting of about bales of new south wales wool bales of van dieman's land wools &c the new south wales wool was first put up and went off very briskly at prices averaging from s d to s d per lb which quotations are higher than those last obtained the van dieman's land wools were sold by order of the van dieman's land company being a portion of the last arrivals from the company's flocks they met a very ready sale and the average prices obtained were from s d to s d per lb the arrivals from germany and other places this year are expected to be very great the brig stirling castle captain fraser sailed from greenock on wednesday morning for sidney new south wales having on board the rev j d lang

fromthis town making the number of passengers in all about of whom above and cabin passengers the equality of sexes—the examiner of saturday las has some witty remarks on the plaint which appeared in our paper on the excess of females over males in the census which he assures us is entirely owing to the lives of females being prolonged by their better regularity this is a sly censure upon the habit of our countrymen onefifth or sixth part of whom we were supposed by implication to be cut off permanently by intemperance we admit that a few hearty fellows do go off in apoplexy but we deny that the number bears any proportion to the amount supposed we have two other remarks to make on his statement first since our manners were corrupted by imitating english fashions it is whispered we hope un that there are such things as tippling women in country some of whom do disappear suddenly—no matter how and secondly we wish our london friend inform us how it happens that while all broad england has only an excess of per cent females edinburgh should have no less than we understand that since this astounding fact was brought out there has been a great efflux of ladies from the city to the adjoining counties we know a number who have or are flying to fife and the north a friend who careful observer compares it to the dispersion of the jews the ladies he says attribute their flight to cholera maribus the ann jameson alexander sailed from leith roads on tuesday morning for bombay van diemen's land and new south wales with a full cargo between twenty and thirty passengers consisting mostly of young ladies the machine breakers—a convict ship at portsmouth is on the point of sailing for van diemen's land with between two and three hundred convicts on board who have been lately convicted for machinebreaking extorting money and other offences committed in the disturbed counties another ship with convicts of the same description will be dispatched for new south wales in about a fortnight these convicts have been kept entirely separate from all other prisoners and an accurate report will be made to the governors of the colonies as to their former character their trades and employments and the recommendations which have been made in their favour subsequently to their trials the capital convicts whose lives have been spared are to be transported for life and the convicts sentenced and recommended by the judges for transportation are to be transported according to their respective sentences leith extensive preparations are already begun amongst e[] shipping for the various spring voyages to distant ports[] six vessels are advertised for america one for van dieman's land and new south wales and the whalers[] are unfurling their canvass and will sail for the [] regions on monday or tuesday first the departure of these ships will give the docks a naked appearance the more apparent from the few foreign vessels present here mr hume differed from the view taken of the subject by the right hon baronet he was of opinion that it was the duty of government to give commutation allowance to pensioners anxious to emigrate either to new south wales or to canada he could not forebear complaining of the large increase of pensions which had taken place since the year it was impossible to doubt that much misconduct had existed somewhere the penal colonies botany bay serves as a recipient for criminals whose reformation is hopeless and whom it is therefore desirable to remove from the society to whose peace and security they are sworn enemies this is the sole value of the colony if it did not exist recourse would be had more frequently to perpetual imprisonment and the gibbet experience shews however that transportation does not produce the intended effect of terrifying the guilty its monitory operation depends greatly on the situation of the criminal agricultural labourers with families dread it extremely while to single men mechanics who are sure of receiving high wages and generally to all those who feel a desire of change and a vague expectation of pushing their fortunes it appears to hold out no terrors whatever in the colony there is a competition among settlers to obtain convinct servants and those who get them endeavour from a regard to their own interest to render the situation of the convicts as little irksome as possible the evidence proves that when the feeling degradation is once overcome the situation of the australian convict is in many respects preferable to that of the agricultural labourer in this country he has better clothing more abundant food and enjoys a finer climate the hardship too of compulsory labour is but for a limited time the convict who is transported for years is allowed a ticket of leave at the end of years once possessed of this ticket he is allowed to work on his own account and with high wages easily acquires capital the committee see little chance of rendering punishment effective in the colony they recommend various subordinate regulations and among others they suggest as a remedy for the great expense attending transportation that no convict be assigned to a settler until he shall have paid or given security for the payment by instalments of the expense incurred in the conveyance of the convict from the mother country we are satisfied that the true check to the increase of crime is to be found first in the diffusion of education and sound knowledge and second in the improvement of our judicial and municipal institutions law in all its important branches should be dispensed by paid and responsible persons a judge ought to be stationed in each small district and keep open court every day of the year he should be chosen by some popular constituency which would faithfully represent the feelings of the mass of suitors and as a guarantee for his diligence he should hold his office only for seven years and be reeligible justices of peace if retained at all should be elected as in most of the american states by the householders for three four or seven years jails also should be placed under the controul of popular bodies and thrown open to the improving efforts of private benevolence in this as in other points we have much to learn from the americans who never forget that the criminal is still a man the grand defect in our legislation has been that the rich made laws for the poor of whose situation they had scarcely any knowledge and with whose feelings wants and moral condition they had of course no sympathy the unpaid magistracy of britain is a barbarism belonging to the tenth century thirty years hence men will wonder how their forefathers tolerated so monstrous a system trade wool—the accounts received in lond from new south wales to the th of january state that the produce of the last year's clip of wool in australia will be greatest than that of the preceding year and the the quality has also considerably improved from van dieman's land it is now ascertained that the supply this year will be short but the general quality is very superior in the course of about a week or ten days large arrivals of wool are looked for from new south wales and the private contract business is expected to be very active the public sales of wools went off on friday very well and at full prices the arrivals of this week have consisted of about bales of which about bales were van dieman's land wools and the rest german there is a steady demand and as it is understood that the manufacturers are short of stock the anticipations are that trade will son be greatly improved york wool market may —the market commenced here for this season this day with only a small show of wool and not many buyers the holders asking very high prices caused part to be left unsold the following are the prices hogs from s to s hogs and ewes s d to s d locks s to s d per stone of lbs bradford market—the supply of merinos in the markets on thursday evening was by no means equal to the demand—all qualities in six quarter wide merinoes were eagerly bought up and in some instances a farther advance was obtained three quarter wide merinoes run much in demand but a very scanty supply the advance on six quarter wide merinoes is from s to s per piece compared with what was given at the beginning of the year and three quarter wide are proportionably higher unless a reduction takes place in the price of wool the manufacturers state they must have a further advance rochdale flannel market—the market today was very lively for this season of the yar low goods both for white and for dyeing were of very ready sale and in some instances a little advance was obtained several sales were effected in fine qualities and if the demand proves permanent the prospect for the coming season is very promising liverpool cotton market—there has been but a limited inquiry for cotton during the week the sales are only about bugs at declining prices emigration—within these few days other three vessels left leith for america and australia with emigrants the marjory stocks sailed on friday for quebec and montreal with about passengers and the economist slocombe on sunday for piciou and quebec with about the scotis watson also sailed on sunday for van diemen's land &c with about passengers we have received sydney papers to the th feb they contain reports of themost satisfactory nature as to the harvest at the swan river settlement the promise of abundance had been fully realized and the result is that the settlers have obtained from their own land five months' consumption of agricultural produce thus affording well founded hopes that in two or three years they will be independent of foreign supply—globe on tuesday thirtyone male convicts were embarked at leith for the hulks in the thames preparatory to their transhipment for new south wales except those in whose cases a commutation of punishment may take place edward thorpe a young lad was remitted to the sheriff for having broken into the new market at stocksbridge and stolen a quantity of meat and other articles he pled guilty and we understand he has stated that he is anxious to get a free passage to new south wales as he is tired of living in this country the wool trade—the whole of the london public sales of colonial and other woold having now been gone through the wool trade is in a more settled state and transactions by private contract are conducted on a more extensive scale the total amount of the late sales the last of which took place on tuesday was bales and the colonial wools were taken by the manufactures at the extreme advance realized at the previous sales in july in some cases indeed quotations from d to d per lb in advance were obtained the sales on saturday was most fully attended and increased boldness was observed the colonial wools offered on that day fetched excellent prices some few bales were also offered forming a part of the second clip of wools in the new colony on the swan river they were much better in quality than those last received some german lambs' wool also commanded attention and sold as high as s d to s per lb the sale on tuesday the last of the series was not quite so fully attended as those of last wekk but according to quality full prices were obtained the sale consisted

s d to s d per lb the best portugal s d to s d the best spanish s d to s d the best cape s d to s d the best van diemen's land s d to s d and the best german s to s d per lb the result of these sales is to establish a much firmer market for wools of all descriptions than previously existed the arrivals of wool are limited and this week only bales of german wool and abotu bales of neapolitan wool have been entered at the custom house emigration the returns to the house of commons on the motion of mr stewart mackenzie relative to emigration contain some curious and important information the returns are three in number return of the number of person who have emigrated from great britain and ireland to the british colonies and to the united states of america in each year from to the st of

as long as much misery or much discontent exists among our working classes upper canada the great recipient of our surplus population is miles from britain a distance which looks extremely formidable but such is the amazing economy of water carriage when seconded by good arrangements that the voyage by sea to montreal can be made at as small expense as the journey by land to manchester the passage money from dublin to montreal or quebec exclusive of food has been as low as s and it would not be higher probably from leith or greenock if the emigrants were in sufficient numbers and so prompt in their arrangements that the vessel lost no time beyond what was strictly necessary for taking her full compliment aboard if the ship is detained a month before this is got the owners must of course be indemnified for the detention by a higher fare four stone of oatmeal with a little ham or salt fish for variety will subsist a man or woman on the voyage and thus a human being can be conveyed over a distance equal to onesixth part of the circumference of the globe and six times longer we dare say than the wanderings of ulysses at the small coast of s in an article in may we pointed out the rapid strides with which emigration was advancing and some parliamentary papers we have received since exhibit new proofs of its extraordinary progress it has in fact outstripped the expectations of the most sanguine the following table shows the number of person who have emigrated in the last eight years to north america the cape and australia — british america united states cape of g hope australia total it will be seen from this table how steady the increase of emigration has been especially to canada it must be observed that a great proportion probably more than a half of those who sailed for the united states were destined for the british colonies and only chose that route as the most eligible on account of the facilities which the hudson and its associated canals present for travelling to the upper province canada and nova scotia must have drawn at least settlers from britain last year and yet such are the capacities of these colonies for absorbing population that the price of labour was not lowered in the least degree and from the previous arrangements made it is announced that a much larger number of persons could have been received without inconvenience sanguine as we were upon the subject we did not anticipate that emigration could be conducted on such a scale with the extraordinary ease certainty and economy now exemplified those who reflect on the distress and perplexity which would be produced by landing the sixthpart of eighty thousand strangers on the shores of britain in one summer will appreciate the extremely dissimilar condition of a colony which with less than a million inhabitants can take in eightythousand new settlers in the same period without embarassment or confusion the general result is that britain sent off souls from her population last year of whom a[] number sailed miles a number and those who made the shortest voyage miles the annals of emigration afford nothing approaching to this in any part of the world and yet we may reasonably expect to see still greater things atcheived it appears from the various census since that the annual increase in britain if no persons left it would be about or we may place the fact in a more striking light by stating that there are about a thousand persons more in the three kingdoms every day than there was on the day before if by raising the habits and ideas of the labouring classes we could get this daily increase reduced one half and the other half could be carried off by emigration—if we could by this means keep the supply of labour stationary while capital was increasing a great improvement would be effected in the state of the population now from what has been stated it appears that the emigrants who leave our shores annually amount to nearly onethird of the annual excess already and in a year or two there is every probability that it will amount to onehalf of emigrants who landed at quebec and montreal last year went from england from ireland and from scotland in the year the numbers were from england ireland scotland of the emigrants from scotland last year sailed from greenock from leith from cromarty from aberdeen from dundee from alloa from islay from anna from glasgow from leven from campbeltown and numbers under from stanraer peterhead and irvine of the emigrants to the united states last year sailed from liverpool from london from bristol from londonderry and from greenock mr buchanan the government agent at quebec states in his report that the general description of emigrants who arrived last year many respectable and wealthy families came from all part of the united kingdom and the extent of property and specie brought into the country by them is exceedingly great fully amounting to from t to t sterling about persons were sent out by pecuniary aid from parishes or landlords and there were commuted pensioners military we believe many of them men of irregular habits and ill fitted for the situation of settlers of these about returned to britain the fear of cholera was a considerable check to emigration it appeared in quebec on the th of june and the persons who arrived after that suffered much from the difficulty of procuring lodgings even for a day but mr buchanan estimates the whole number of emigrants who fell victims to the disease at no more than the demand for all classes of working people says the report has never been exceeded in the canadas particularly since the abatement of the cholera and i can assure your lordship that during my late tour through the districts and settlements of upper canada i did not see an industrious emigrant who could not meet with emplyment the number of that class arrived this year is not adequate to supply the demand created by the more wealthy emigrants this was particularly felt in the western and london districts of the upper province where the want of labourers was so great that it was found necessary to encourage a number to come over from ohio and pennsylvania this was written on the th dec and the arrival of emigrants closed in october another cargo of females is now shipping on board the ann captain herd in the london docks for sydney these

wales or van dieman's land who after stating their inability to defray the whole charge of their conveyance solicit aid for that purpose on condition of repaying the same out of their earnings in the colony where they propose to settle his majesty's government has sanctioned the appropriate of a limited sum out of the colonial revenues of new south wales and van diemen's land to assist the private funds of such emigrants as may appear likely to earn the means of repayig that aid and to become useful settlers the following are the regulations under which this induglence will be dispensed— no advance will be made except to young and married agricultural labourers who intend taking their wives and families with them and a strict inquiry will be instituted into their character and habits of industry before the assistance they solicit will be granted to them no one family will be allowed an advance exceeding t and it will be useful therefore for parties who may not possess the remainder of the sum requisite for defraying the expense of their passage to apply for assistance every person desirous of receiving the proposed advance must fill up and send back to the under secretary of state for the colonial department the return hereto annexed if the information contained in this return and the answers to the inquiries which may be addressed to the parties who certify the correctness of the return shall be considered satisfactory the applicant will receive notice to that effect he may then proceed to make his agreement with the owners or masters of ships proceeding to

sealed dispatch to the governor containing the name and description of the party on whose account the money is to be paid and encolosing a promissory note which he will be required to sign in acknowledgement of his debt which note must be witnessed by the captain and chief mate of the vessel but arrangements will be made by which the payment of this order will not take place in the colony until the captain shall have produced the parties on whose account it is to be made before the officer appointed for that purpose and they shall have entered into a fresh obligation for the repayment of the advance made to them for it is the intention of his majesty's government and cannot be too clearly understoof by all persons who may accept this loan that repayments of the debt in such proportions and at such intervals as may not be unsuitable to the circumstances of each emigrant shall be strictly enforced by means of the ample powers which the laws of the colony render available for that purpose government agents for emigration have been appointed at liverpool bristol dublin cork limerick belfast and greenock who have been instructed to afford gratuitous information to all persons applying to them as to the best means of carrying their schemes of emigration into effect parties therefore who may reside in the neighbourhood of these agents are requested to apply to them

new south wales we understand from good authority that government has decided upon sanctioning the foundation of a new colony on the coast of south australia the plan on which this undertaking is to be conducted is explained in a work entitled england and america this first act of mr stanley's successor is an earnest of his becoming a most valuable minister for the colonies of this country a highly respectable and very numerous meeting is holding this exeterhall on the subject of the new colony in australia the establishment of which has recently received the sanction of the government australian emigration bill—mr w whitmore brough in a bill for establishing a colony in southern australia the bill was read a first time and ordered to be read a second time on wednesday next south australian emigration association a meeting of the members of the south australian association was held on monday at exeter hall for the purpose of explaining the principles objects plan and prospects of a new colony proposed to be founded in south australia mr w whitmore in the chair upon taking the chair mr whitmore stated that the first question which the meeting would have to consider would be this—whether there existed or not at present any necessity for a more extended system of colonization it appeared to him that there was a great defect in our present system of colonication and that it would be greatly to our advantage if we established it upon a new principle well and seriously considered that which struck him as the greatest defect was that we did not provided that colonization which included within it members of all classes of society large numbers of emigrants went out with capital but not carrying with them that number of the lower class which was necessary to employ their capital to advantage in other cases perhaps almost as numerous the labourer went out without capital which was necessry to enable him to employ his labour to advantage this was a striking defect now the question which they were then called upon to consider regarded the best means of remedying that defect those means it appeared to him were quite practicable and might be accomplished in this manner vz by establishing as a system that all the waste lands which they were about to colonize should be sold at a given price such as the market would command and that the proceeds of such sales should be employed in sending out to the colonies a sufficient number of labourers to cultivate the lands so sold if this system could be carried into effect he apprehended that all the evils of our present system of colonization would be removed and that we should be enabled to transplant a portion of the community of the mother country with all its various grades into the new country which they now proposed to coloniz he believed that if we proceeded upon this principle we should lay the foundation of the greatest colony which england had ever settled mr grote mp moved the first resolution—that the wealth and prosperity of this country have been greatly promoted by the establishment of british colonies in various parts of the world and that colonization when conducted systematically and upon sound principles offers the means of extending indefinitely the commercial empire of the united kingdom and the field of employment for british capital and labour he would not enter into the recommendations which this undertaking offered to all classes of the community but he would venture to state that to any gentleman who considered the prospectus which had been put out by the association and who recollected that it was a matter of certainty that the land in the colony was to be used as the means of raising a fund to carry over thither the labour which was superabundant here it must be evident that from this important innovation on our colonial system great benefit must be derived[] both to the new colony and to the mother country mr clay mp in seocnding the resolution entered at great length into the difficulty of finding employment which now prevails in all parts of the community and then after condemning the corn laws continued thus—colonization if carried on to a considerable extent would as effectually add millions of fertile acres to our shores as if the irish sea were filled up with fertile land if that miracle took place is it not clear that all distress would immediately cease and that the emplyment which the addition of so many fertile acres would afford must give a new stimulus to the prosperity of the country is it not clear that the miserable compotation[] for potatogardens in ireland would cease and that the difficulties flowing from an unemployed population would cease does any man doubt that it would be well worth the while of our capitalists to take such land at from s to s an acre hear yet this plan is in effect the same as if the land were added to our own island because if this plan of colonization be adopted a transplantation of a sufficiency of labourers now wanting employment from this country for its culture will take place which is equivalent to the transportation of the land to the labourer in point of fact the ocean joins these distant lands instead of separating them hear—there can be no doubt but that a wider comercial code and the removal of restrictions on labour would greatly facilitate extend and increase the commercial intercourse between the old nation of the world but in no case would the increase be in proportion to that which might be calculated on as the consequence of a connection with newlyformed countries in other climates as regards the establishment of colonies it is virtually an extension of the mother country colonel torrens mp proposed the second resolution—that in establishing colonies great care ought to be taken to combine labour and capital with land in such proportions as are best calculated to insure the prosperity of all classes of society and that in establishing modern colonies this important consideration has been so generally overlooked it was he said almost unnecessary for him to state that in all systems of colonization land labour and capital ought to be combinedin just proportions and yet this simple principle had been hitherto greatly neglected by those who had led new colonies from the mother country in the first place the whole of the land of this colony was to be public land no individual was to obtain a single acre by gift there was to be no patronage no job—all were to be on a footing of equality and nobody was to have a single inch of land for nothing there would also be another advantage in this system which would arise in the following —in other colonies the labourer who had gone out and found that he could get land for nothing had often fallen into the mistake that land was wealth instead of it being merely the means of producing wealth that fatal mistake had often led him to refuse the work of the master with whom he had gone out and set up for himself as an independent landowner he had in consequence set up where he was far away from the market of the colony where he had no roads over which to convey his produce and where he had perished miserably but in this colony the labourers would be compelled for some time to work for hire mr guest mp seconded the resolution mr hutt mp moved the third resolution to the following effect—that in order to promote the greatest prosperity of a new colony it is expedient that all waste land without any exception shall be declared public land and be disposed of to individuals by sale only and according to an uniform impartial and permanent system captain gowan seconded the resolution and spoke in the highest terms of the salubrity of the climate of australia many of his fellow soldiers in india had gone there for the recovery of their health and had found something so temperate and soothing in the country that they had retired there altogeher preferring its mild and gentle breeze to the chills of their native country england mr p scrope mp moved that it is also desirable that the whole of the purchase money of public land without any deduction should be employed in providing a free passage from the mother country to the colony of young adult persons of the labouring class who may be willing to emigrate and in equal proportion of both sexes as the want of labour was the great difficulty in all infant colonies the more labour they imported the greater labour did they give their land the more they got for the sale of it the greater was their power of importing fresh labour this resolution therefore acted in a reciprocal manner upon itself and when it was once fairly put into operation they would proceed onwards on the road to prosperity with accelerated velocity meeting with no other obstacle than the unwillingness of england to part with her inhabitants mr wilks mp seconded the resolution mr handson moved —that amongst the unoccupied portions of the earth which form part of the british dominions the south coast of australia appears to be a sport peculiarly suitable for founding a colony upon the principles embodied in the preceding resolutions the place where this colony was to be founded was one distinguished from every other part of australia from its possessing a facility of internal communications prior even to the formation of roads and the soil would amply repay the labour expended on its cultivation mr robert owen not of lanark said that the coasts of this colony abounded with whales and that its whale fisheries might become valuable mr m d hill rose to propose the resolution embodying the mode of carrying the principles of this association into effect no colony could go on without some law he did not care how little they had of it provided they made up in quality what was deficient in quantity the hon member entered into an elaborate description of the laws intended to be enacted for the colony and concluded by moving—that the provisions for the peace order and good government of the british province of south australia as contained in the bill now before parliament are highly satisfactory mr d wakefield seconded the resolution sir w molesworth mp proposed and mr childers mp seconded the following resolution —that it is the opinion of this meeting that the thanks of the country are due to mr spring rice for his prompt and enlightened conduct in promoting the beneficial public object of the south australian association the resolutions were carried unanimously thanks were given to the chairman and the meeting at which many ladies were present broke up the proceedings lasted from twelve o'clock to a quarter before five house of commons—july continued from our last a message from the lords announced that their lordships had agreed to the amendments to the ministers appointment scotland bill to the newspaper postage bill and to the orkney statute labour bill affairs of oude on the order of the day for the third reading of the universities' admission bill being moved— mr herriks[] took the occasion of calling on government to explain the circumstances which had occurred in certain transactions between the board of controul and the east india directors these transactions the hon gentleman stated to be the repeated peremptory commands of the board of controul to the directors of the east india company to prepare a despatch for the purpose of directing the indian government to compel the king of oude to pay certain claims made on him on behalf of calcutta bankers which commands the court of directors refused to obey on the ground that the interference which the board of controul required them to exercise with the king of oude was inconsistent with the relations subsisting between the british government and the king of oude and would be most mischievous in effect on the st of january the right jon gentleman had appliedfor and obtained a rule to show cause why under the act of parliament a mandamus should not issue to compel the court of directors to comply with the desire ofthe board of controul on the st of january the court of king's bench was prepared to give its decision upon the application for the mandamus when without any reason being assigned the right hon president of the board of controul withdrew his application mr c grant said that in the regret which had been expressed respecting the possible collision between the two authorities he fully concurred bu entertaining such a sentiment he confessed it surprised him not a little to find his right hon friend endeavouring to open a dispute already composed the right honourable gentleman then proceeded to give a brief outline of the case and referred to the various high authorities connected with india who had declared in favour of the demand with regard to his having withdrawn the application for the mandamus without explanation he had to say that he fully explain his opinions to the directors he had restated them verbally to the chairman and he did not think himself required under the circumstances to reenter into a long discussion upon the point the effect of the recommendation to the king of oude was merely to urge the claim upon his attention sir r peel said it was a perfectly novel doctrine and in the present state of the world most inconvenient that the nonpayment of debts due to his subjects should give the king of england a right forcibly to intervene with foreign states except where sanctioned by positive treaty mr hume contended that on the whole the debt was a just one and ought to be paid the subject here dropped admission of dissenters to the universities on the question that this bill be read a third time mr t gladstone rose to oppose it it would he said be useless to pass the bill for it would of necessity be inoperative if he were asked why he opposed a bill which if passed would be inoperative his answer was that he objected to its principle the admission of which was equally destructive whether it effected the object of its promoters or not further they were bound to respect corporate rights as long as the intentions of their founders were fulfilled and no one could deny that the universities did fulfilthe intentions of their founders hear hear mr v smith supported the bill as one calculated to take away a reproach from the establishment and be felt as a compliment by the dissenters whose only desire was to exercise their vigorous intellects in the promotion of science and literature mr baines said that the original statutes showed that there were then no tests nor did any exist at oxford in either the time of the lollards or of wickliff the term university had in it an argument for thegeneral use of these seats of learning which were meant to be universal both as to the subjects taught and the persons to whom they were communicated in this sense the term was understood and applied in other countries and it was an extraordinary fact deserving of attention that the universities of oxford and of cambridge were the only universities that were closed to a large proportion of the upper classes of the people in any country in europe this the dissenters of england felt as a grievous indignity and they thought it unjust that englishmen should attempt to degrade englishmen by excluding them from the best seats of literature and science mr h hughes could not accede to the measure and therefore moved that it be read that day six months mr goulburn contended that the introduction of the dissenters as proposed under the present bill would be nothing short of the destruction of the present system of education at the universities it was indisputable that at a university religion could only be taught according to some set form abandon that mode of tuition and you abandon the religion itself cries of no no if they let in dissenters it was perfectly obvious the intentions of the founders of those establishments would be completely defeated he therefore deprecated the measures as injurious to religon and opposed to the best interest of the country lord palmerstone sir r inglis and mr g wood then addressed the house but amidst such discordant noises as prevented what they said being heard the laughing jeering shouting were such as has seldom been heard in particular two hon members who entered from the smoking room into the opposite gallery during the address of mr wood and who stretched themselves at full length on the seats secure from the observation of the speaker kept up a row of the most discreditable character the speaker with much indignation in his tone and manner called the parties to order the motion for the third reading was carried on a division by to the trading companies bill the arms importation ireland bill and the court of chancery ireland bill went through committees the four courts dublin bill the weights and measures bill and the turnpike acts amendment bill were read a third time and passed the almanack stamps repeal bill the assessed taxes repeal bill and the militia ballot suspension bill were brought in and read a first time the house was counted out at three o'clock in the morning tuesday july sir john cam hobhouse and general sir edward barnes took the oaths and their seats the former for nottingham in the room of lord duncannon raised to the peerage the latter for sudbury in the room of m a taylor esq deceased on the motion of mr alderman thompson the durham and sunderland railway bill was read a third time and passed southern australia mr s rice moved the order of the day for the house to resolve into committee upon the bill for the colonization of southern australia mr a baring rose and stated various objections to the project the hon member contended that at this period of the year there was not time to deliberate upon such an important subject and independent of this preliminary objection he said he did not conceive that government ought to sanction any such experiment without a full conviction that there was a reasonable probability of its success in his opinion the experiment was founded upon bases more mistaken than any similar one which had ever been tried in fact according to the plan which had been laid down the colony would be tied up by mortgages in such a way that it would not again revert to the crown so that the territory would be lost the result would be that if the gentlemen who set the project on foot were mistaken—as he was sure they had been—we would be prevented from touching this large portion of australia unless we could pay off the debt which had been contracted while he stated these objections to the plan he was anxious not to be understood to be inimical to colonization for he was very favourable to it every new opening to colonization he was convinced was a substantial benefit to the poorer classes hear hear hear it was not therefore to the principle of colonization that he was opposed but he objected to this bill becaue the plan was a most mistaken one and would eventually shut up this large portion of the world one of his main objections was to the extent to which it was proposed to carry the experiment let the gentlemen take if they like square miles but let them not risk the whole of a great continent people like fuel he said could not well be carried too far they might get a few thousands to go out but they would never get the tens of thousands to go which were required for the success of the project the hon member then objected to two of the principles which were laid down by the projectors that land should not be sold lower than s per acre and that no credit should be given he was convinced that any man acquainted with the practical workings of the system in other colonies would blow up the whole plan in a moment no man who went out to australia would think of taking less than two hundred acres now that would cost him t it would cost him t more to get himself and his family over which with stock and other expenses would amount to t or t he would therefore ask any gentlemen in that house whether they thought any man who had t or t in this country would go out and set himself down on two hundred acres in australia hear hear he therefore suggested to his right hon friend to consent that the committee be postponed until another session and then have it referred to a select committee he concluded by moving as an amendment that the bill be committed on that day six months mr w whitmore was thakful for the very candid manner in which the hon member had stated his objections to the bill with respect to the large extent of territory he mr w thought that was necessary as it was intended to introduce a completely new system of colonization—one very different from any thing ever before attempted the extent of land it was intended to take under this act was from to square miles and it was the leading principle of the bill that all the money arising from the sale of lands should be applied to the purpose of sending out labourers free of expense—hear hear hear if this plan succeeded there would be a constant stream of emigrants going out the land sold by the canada company had been at a higher price he had sanguine hopes that all the money it would be necessary to borrow would be easily repaid he most conscientously considered that this bill would prove a very great benefit to the country it would tend exceedingly towards facilitating and amending the conditions of the people of england and ireland and therefore he hoped it would pass mr o'dwyer contended that before the house thought of agreeing to such a bill as this they ought to do something towards the ameloriation of the condition of the people of ireland the various reports which committees of that house had made showed that onefourth of the land of that country was untilled but was at the same time what was called reclaimable land and well calculated for the cultivation and produce of grain let this country advance some of the surplus capital talked of by the hon member towards the cultivation of this bog land and discontent would flee[] from ireland entirely the irish people wanted employment give them that and the house would hear no more about murders fires and other outrages mr s rice in reference to the allusion made by the hon and learned member begged to say that although much of the bog land in question belonged to private individuals yet a portion of it was the property of the government who had been and still were making experiments with a view to ascertain if the views of the commissioners could be carried into effect with respect to the manner in which the hon member for essex had opened this question he must confess that he had brought with him much of usefulness and of experience and of such a character too as could not fail to carry weight the right hon gentleman then proceeded to speak in favour of the proposed colonization of south australia after some farther discussion strangers were ordered to withdraw and the house divided when there appeared—for going into committee against it —majority the bill went through the committee the report was received and ordered to be taken into further consideration on thursday next several petitions were presented and at three o'clock the speaker left the chair the st nicholas morgan which has arrived off aberdeen from bathurst new south wales reports that timber was very scarce that the woods between that town and miramichi were on fire that tons of cut timber had been burnt and the people in the woods had been obliged to abandon their camps and fly to save their lives the thermometer at bathurst was from to colonel c j napier has been appointed governor of the embryo colony in south australia and we believe that a fitter appointment could not have been made we only regret that colonel napier has not been sent to superintend a colony founded on something like sane principles but if this australian project end as we have little doubt it will do in the ruin of those who are weak and silly enough to embark in it no one will ascribe any part of the failure to the incapacity or unfitness of the governor the whole blame will fall on the contrivers of the scheme emigration—according to a general return of emigrants who have left liverpool for the british colonies and the united states of america it appears that from the th of may to the th september persons left there for the colonies and for the united states making a grand total of persons the ships employed were the tonnage and the crews the chief of the emigrants to the united states disembarked at new york having landed there of the emigrants to the colonies went to australia and to quebec the emigration to the west indies during the above period only amounted to to the smaller islands to antigua to jamaica and to demerara the emigrants to van diemen's land were emigration—the venus steamboar left the steam packet wharf st katherine's dock yesterday morning with from to female emigrants to take their passage on board the ship canton for sydney the emigrants were for the most part fine healthy looking girls some of them of exceedingly interesting appearance and almost all of a class much above that in which the distress which prompts to emigration would be supposed to exist a new principle has been recognised in the regulations attendant upon the transportation of convicts from this country to new south wales boys of six and girls of ten years will be allowed to accompany their parents to that distant colony emigration—we observe from an advertisement in our paper of today that another ship is fitting out by government for the free conveyance of females to van dieman's land and as we understand that many applications were made too late for the last ship we would recommend those anxious to take advantage of this opportunity to lose no time in making the neccessary application at leith—the number being strictly limited and being the last ship to sail this year we consider it of great advantage to females of respectability that none are admitted without a strict investigation into their moral character by the emigration committee and that those of a superior class as governesses &c are provided a small sum to defray the expense of the extra outfit free emigration of females t he emigration committee acting under the authority of the secretary of state for the colonies hereby gives notice that the boadicea a fine new ship of tons fitted expressly for the conveyance of females will sail from gravesend on t hursday the st day of o ctober for

but none need apply without certificates of moral character on thursday evening a dinner was given to captain hindmarsh rn to celebrate the circumstance of his majesty having graciously expressed his approbation of the choice of that gentleman to be the governor of the new colony in south australia the entertainment took place at the albion tavern south australia—the act of parliament for founding this colony will now come into full operation the commissioners having complied with the conditions precedent by the sale of t worth of land and by raisingthe required loan for the government of the colony we may therefore expect shortly to see the names of the various officers gazetted some of them have been long ago nominated and we understand that active preparations are making with a view to the immediate departure of the officers and a small body of emigrants this first expedition will be placed under the command of captain hindmarsh rn the governor who with the assistance of the surveyors and other qualified persons will carefully examine the various harbours in the colony the quality of the neighbouring soil the supply of water &c and will select that site which all things considered is most desirable for the first town we believe it is the intention of the commissions not to send out the main body of emigrants until the next spring so as to allow ample time for the necessary preparations for their reception—spectator there have been convents suppressed within the last three years the example was set by the emperor of russia who was by an ukase dated st july abolished convents of monks this was followed by the king of prussia who by a royal order secularised all the convents in the duchy of posen in don pedro put down convents and spain has lately abolished emigration—it will be observed from an advertisement in today's paper that government are fitting another ship for the free conveyance of single females from london to van dieman's land and from the great demand for agricultural labourers and mechanics of every description in that colony it has been resolved to grant a passage to that class at a cost not above what is paid to america—government paying the remainder of the sum as a bounty amounting to t which may certainly be looked upon as a great boon both by individuals and the colony at large in all the colonies there appears to be a scarcity of working people as from an official document in our possession it is asserted on authority that in upper canada agricultural labourers domestic servants and tradesmen of every description will be for some years in great request farm labourers readily obtain from t to t per annum with board lodging and washing and daylabourers from s to s per day with provisions the government agent for emigration for the canadas asserts he could find immediate employment for working people as public improvements are much retarded for want of hands as this is the best season we

the emigration committee london in this letter mr sullivan mentions that the female emigrants on landing were placed in spacious and commodious buildings adjoining the government house at sydney where every attention was paid to their comfort and security from improper intrusion the writer further states — we landed in sydney a greater proportion of well conducted industrious and virtuous young women than were ever before landed from any of the ships of the emigration committee that came to these colonies threefourths of the young women were engaged and went into comfortable situations on the first and second days after landing and before a week all the useful and good servants viz laundresses cooks servants of all work dairymaids and housekeepers were in places many of them in syndey and the surroundings districts several were taken up the country to maitland and bathurst and as many more cooks laundresses dairymaids or farm servants as we had could obtain places in that time for these are the descriptions of female servants in demand throughout the colony the wages varied from t to t some who were not very good servants of all work and housemaids got t to t cooks and laundresses t to t the latter are much wanted housemaids and needlewomen t to t housekeepers t to t governesses also are much sought for it if we had had twenty qualified they could have got situations in respectable families and schools but the salaries to this class are small say t to t nursery governesses got t all the male emigrants who understood agriculture or the management of stock in general but particularly sheep were engaged immediately at salaries varying from t to t with a house and rations for family use we understand that the canton had a number of females from edinburgh and its neighbourhood and the above information must be highly satisafactory to their relatives sir george clerk—as the cawing of the rooks portends a storm it is worth while to mention that the cunning baronet has come down from london and commenced a canvass in this county within these few days it is stated we believe upon good authority that he accounts for this course of proceeding by referring to the great probability of the lords throwing out the irish municipal bill burn's monument—we understand that there is now an early prospect of the completion of this monument which has too long remained in an unfinished state to the surprise of strangers and the discredit to our modern athens the sum already in the treasurer's hands aided by the profits of the handsome musical work lately issued by mr m'leod which he has generously devoted to that purpose is now nearly sufficient to meet the calculations of the expense requird for the railing in and decoration of the ground around the monument we expect therefore that the work will forthwith be commenced and if a few pounds are still wanted we have no doubt there are hundreds in edinburgh who would willingly guarantee the treasurer against any loss by the immediate completion of the undertaking annuity tax—we understand that deputations from several places in the country are expected to attend the public meeting which is to be held on tuesday evening for the purpose of petitioning parliament for the abolition of the annuity tax in order to testify their abhorrence of that system of politico christianity which requires distraint and imprisonment for its support we observe that mr gillon of wallhouse mp is to take the chair the meeting we doubt not will be most numerously attended law of scotland—the prizes given by professor bell for the greatest proficiency in the examinations were yesterday awarded to mr william neish india street in the senior and to william spence broughton place in the junior class the following gentlemen also distinguished themselves in the competition mr john fraser james gilchrist james mason james scott in the senior class james oliver david gale john r banks james charles

congregation in that place the rev d henderson of dalry preached and presided the rev mr cairns of stewarton ordained and the rev d ronald of saltcoats gave the charge to the minister and congregation on the sabbath following the rev mr tait of barrhead introduced mr macgregor to his congregation and there is every prospect that the hitherto long disappointed congregation of kilwinning will now prosper under the pastoral care of their much esteemed and highly talented young minister presentation of plate—mr a s walker late of the commercial bank of scotland at present manager of the branch of the commercial bank of england at uttoxeter in staffordshire was lately presented with an elegant tea service by the proprietors of that establishment bearing the following inscription —presented to mr archibald s walker by the uttoxeter proprietors of the commercial bank of england as a small acknowledgement of his faithful and valuable services—march this is another proof of the estimation in which many of the young men are held who have been trained to the banking system in this country from a return just published we find that the emigration to canada has been comparatively small last year the whole number of emigrants landed at quebec and montreal in was in and four times and in two times as many were sent out of the there were adult males females and children under years of the whole number were sent out by parochial aid the numbers from the three kingdoms were—england ireland scotland from newfoundland nova scotia &c settled in lower canada upper canada died at grosse isle and quebec returned to the united kingdom removed to the united states — but besides those who went to canada landed at new york raising the whole number of emigrants to there were no less than three vessels wrecked last year on their way to quebec—the william ewing from londonderry with passengers all saved—the barque james from newfoundland all saved—and the nathaniel graham from cork with persons on board passengers and crew of whom were lost from another part of the report we find that female emigrants were sent out to australia last year under the superintendence of the emigration committee of these had a free passage the arrangements seem to have been ood for the mortality was small and few complaints were made the females were all of decent character and due care was taken on their arrival to get them disposed of as servants in situations where their morals would not be exposed to unnecessary risk ulster railway—length miles from belfast to armagh capital t in shares of

one can have travelled over the ground without observing how admirably it is fitted for this species of communication by its remarkable uniformity of surface we should have doubted whether such a work would pay had it terminated at edinburgh but as a part of an unbroken line reaching across the most fertile and populous parts of scotland from the german ocean to the atlantic its chances of success are vastly increased dundee and arbroath railway—the committee's report on this railway has reached us but we must confine ourselves to an abstract the length is miles furlongs and yards the capital t

scottish statute labour acts and to consider what amendments may be made thereon it may be stated that by the present act for this county proprietors of land and several other descriptions of people are totally exempted from any burden on account of the coaches chaises gigs or saddle horses they may keep though it is quite plain good roads are of as much advantage to them as to the occupiers of land upon whom almost the sole burden is thrown in many parishes a considerable addition would be made to the road funds were no such exemptions allowed at present the management is vested in heritors rated at one hundred pounds scots and upwards though it is stated with confidence that were the occupiers of land included beneficial consequences would follow—east lothian correspondent leith mechanics' friendly assurance society—the fifth annual meeting of this institution was held on tuesday last—john hutton esq one of the honorary members president of the society in the chair a very satisfactory report for the last year was read and thanks were voted to the different officebearers it appears that this society was established under the countenance of the magistrates and ministers and various influential individuals in leith and is well deserving of encouragement as affording the benefits of mutual insurance to the working classes the lowest rates consistent with perfect security the funds we understand are in a prosperous state hay and straw—in consequence of it having been alleged last wednesday that higher prices were got for straw than those quoted we have made due inquiry and find there are no grounds for such an allegation we have been further assured that in reporting the prices of hay and straw for these two years past the clerk of the corn market has never shown a desire to favour the farm servants at the expense of their employers or to favour either party at the expense of the public the lords commissioners of the admiralty have been pleased to grant by their warrant dated the th of april a distinguishing flag to be worn by the respective vessels belonging to the eastern regatta club of scotland viz a blue cornet flag with a white st andrew's cross on the upper quarter on a red field heriot's hospital—at the meeting of the governors of george heriot's hospital on thursday the th instant the estimate of messrs trotter for alterations and repairs on the chapel amounting to t was accepted and it will gratify the friends of economy to learn that this is t under the sum voted by a majority of the governors for that purpose some time ago thereafter a unanimous vote of thanks was passed to councillor gillespie graham for gratuitously furnishing a plan of the intended improvements on the chapel which was described by councillor grant and others as highly creditable to the skill and good taste of that distinguished architect the governors then proceeded to consider the list of applications for admission of boys preparatory to the usual halfyearly election there were vacancies and applicants who may be thus classed — those who have never received benefit from george heriot's hospital or any other institution those who have received benefit for one child do for two children do for three children do for five children in considering cases the present practise of the governors is to give preference first to children of widows being poor then to those who have never received benefit afterwards those who have had only one child in and so on these were but three applications for widow's children and one for an orphan out of the above number and it is therefore probable considering the large population of edinburgh that it is not sufficiently known that george heriot in his will expressly points out the fatherless and poor being children of burgesses and freemen as the objects of his charity—hence if there be not a sufficient numbers of really necessitous cases the governors in filling up the vacancies may elect some that do not appear to have strong claims simply from those that have such claims not coming forward in sufficient numbers political economy—on thursday last the course of lectures on political economy delivered by dr thomas murray in elder street chapel was brought to a conclusion on which occasion the thanks of the meeting were on the motion of one of the members of committe voted by acclamation to the lecturer for his valuable services after thanks had been returned by dr murray mr a g hunter merchant was called to the chair and some conversation having taken place the committee of management who had necessarily been selfelected were confirmed by the meeting in their office and empowered to take such steps as they might think expedient for obtaining lectures to the industrious classes next winter we understand that dr murray is to be entertained at supper some evening next week on the occasion of being presented with a piece of silver plate it is with much regret we learn that john grieve esq of newington cottage died on monday last he was beloved and esteemed for his estimable qualities by all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance and his death will be long and deeply regretted rare sights in london—a young scottish miss who had voyaged the length of london on a pleasure jaunt returned the other day by one of the steamers and was met on landing by various members of her family who anxiously inquired what she had seen in london seen exclaimed the fair tourist i have seen such sights i saw the theological garden and all the wild beasts in't the theatre—mr c kean concluded his engagement on thursday evening—an engagement the longest and most brilliant of any that our theatre has witnessed for many years mr kean has been with us for a whole month and has succeeded in crowding the house almost every night we understand that upwards of persons have visited the theatre during his engagement—a number beyond that of any former period of equal duration in that time he has appeared in some of the most arduous and difficult of shakespeare's characters hamlet richard macbeth othello shylock and king john investing each with its own peculiar charms and interest and exciting the highest admiration and astonishment at the versatility and power of his genius which could give such individuality and truth to so many dissimilar distinct and separate classes of characters the play with which his engagement concluded was richard which character he has performed seven times during his engagement the house was as usual crowded in every part and he exerted himself most strenuously and successfully at the conclusion the cheers of the audience were loud and long and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage from different parts of the house mr k being loudly called for appeared in front of the stage and delivered the following very neat and appropriate address— ladies and gentlemen—i now stand before you for the last time this season but believe me whichever way my pilgrimage may bend my thoughts will ever recur to edinburgh as those of a child to its distant home fondly anticipating the hour when he shall again stand upon its threshold great cheering till that period permit me with a heavy but a grateful heart to pronounce that melancholy word—farewell mr kean then withdrew amidst reiterated and enthusiastic plaudits from all parts of the house —mr k we perceive appears next in aberdeen where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his performances the boxes there we are told are already taken for several successive nights to come—mrs honey from the theatre royal haymarket makes her appearance here on monday first on wednesday evening mr john g moxey baker castle street was entertained at supper in menzie's hotel and tavern waterloo place by a party of friends of about fifty in number previous to his leaving this country for america to which he is about to emigrate the company was very harmonious and the compliment must have been very gratifying to mr moxey qualifications of general assembly elders—the presbytery of cupar at their meeting on the th ult elected the earl of leven and melville and walter malcolm esq edinburgh to represent them in the ensuing assembly mr malcolm is factor for captain hay of mugdrum who is principal heritor in the parish of newburgh and was lately ordained an elder there against his election to serve in the assembly a protest and appeal were taken on the grounds as we understand that he has no domicile within the bounds of presbytery and is not an officiating elder the protesters allowing that his election though consistent with the letter is contrary to the spirit of an act of assembly passed in if the appeal is sustained it is evident that a large proportion of the assembly elders must vacate their seats intimation also was given by d maitland m'gill esq that when the commissions came to be attested he would move for evidence being produced that the elderselect maintain family worship an amusing inquiry was instituted in the presbytery last year respecting the earl of leven's habits of domestic devotion and a clerical member had the candour to say he should wish to know how it was with the ministers themselves in that respect the university of st andrews has just conferred the degree of doctor of divinity on the rev professor paxton of edinburgh in bestowing this public honour on one who during a long and useful life has done so much for the cause of literature and religion the members of the college have done an act which shows that they can appreciate real merit and which will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious public of scotland those who have had the good fortune to enjoy the public ministrations of professor paxton and even the general churchgoing community are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence of the pious and heartfelt warmth and of the classical elegance which have long characterised his public preaching even beyond the religious body of which he is the ornament he is well known as one of the most popular and impressive teachers of the day in his lectures on theology as professor to the general associate synod and afterwards to the associate synod he displayed the results of an extensive and profound critical study of the scriptures and of an unwearied research into the natural history and the manners and usages of the ancients nations the work by which he is chiefly known as an author—the illustrations of scripture—will long bear testimony to the extent of his learning and of his oriental investigations and to his powers of lucid and eloquent composition we understand that the attention of the college was directed to mr paxton's merits by the distinguished professor of oriental languages this anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the same field of study reflects high honour on the discrimination and the heart of mr tennant public dinner to professor dick—on tuesday last the students ofthe edinburgh veterinary college and a number of veterinary surgeons and other gentlemen in all upwards of from various parts of scotland entertained professor dick to a public dinner in the waterloo hotel john lambert esq in the chair and alexander gordon jun esq croupier the stewards were ed pyper esq of west craigs j r laing esq jun of dunkenny samuel wordsworth jun esq ws dr malcolm james miller esq and george rennie esq—amongst the gentlemen present we observed professors low and lizars drs robertson spittal knox and aitken mr ferguson surgeon j b murdoch esq of coldoch charles gordon esq secretary to the highland society of scotland a t blackwood esq of oggs castle mr dick senior &c the cloth having been removed and the usual loyal toasts drank the chairman in a neat and appropriate speech proposed the health of professor dick to whom the present meeting had assembled to do honour and who at once commanded their esteem as a member of society and their admiration as a man of talent which toast was drank with the greatest enthusiasm the chairman then proposed his grace the duke of gordon and the highland and agricultural society of scotland patrons of the edinburgh veterinary college which was followed by a variety of other appropriate toasts many excellent songs were sung and the conviviality of the evening was kept up until a late hour royal infirmary—we understand that the stewards of the late fancy ball for the benefit of the royal infirmary have by their judicious arrangements in the management of the ball been enabled to pay over to the trustees of that institution after deducting all expenses the sum of t s d the managers of the infirmary as well as the public at large are certainly much indebted to the gentlemen who acted as stewards upon that occasion for their valuable extertions particularly at the present time in support of this great and useful institution for the relief of those labouring under the united calamities of indigence and disease papers from madras to the th of january have been received accounts had arrived through singapore from the ship mangles stating that when passing through torres straits she touched at murray's island where they discovered eight europeans part of the crew of the longmissing bark charles eaton in a state of slavery but the natives would not deliver up the men the charles eaton was supposed to have been lost on the barrier reef in torres straits in in prosecution of her voyage from new south wales to madras but no precise intelligence of her fate was previously known the ironworks which had been erected at porto novo were proceeding with activity and some railing had been made there quite equal it is stated to anything og the kind manufactured in england every thing is jobbed female emigration to australia &c from a correspondent our penal settlements appear to be very indifferently managed and we are glad to find that such a man as sir john franklin is appointed to govern van diemen's land and the sooner an improved system is adopted for new south wales the better not only are men sent out to govern who are ignorant of human nature a knowledge of which is essential to the management of the heterogenous materials of our penal colonies but when the government at home opens its eyes to any proposal for improvementit is mismanaged our rulers have the sense to see the importance of sending our respectable females to these colonies but they trust an emigration committee and this committee trusts individuals who desire to make the most of the concern and we are glad to have an opportunity of making the public acquainted with the mode in which the business is conducted in the hope that some humane member of parliament will take the subject up the mode of managing female emigration is this — a temptation in the first place is held out of a free passage to australia a ship is hired and this ship must ave a full cargo to satisfy the owners advertisements are issued and instead of hard working females a parcel of decayed governesses dressmakers &c &c with a small mixture of better articles is made up but if as almost always happens a sufficient number of these to fill the ship does not come forward a supply of sweepings is taken from a workhouse here then is such a mixture of good bad and indifferent to the amount of two hundred and upwards that there is enough of evil to corrupt the good as to the comfort of the poor creatures they are crammed four into one bed such is the power of jobbing that we happen to know the fact that some young women of respectability who wished to go to new south wales with their friends were refused a free passage unless they went to london to go in the government ship thus we see that the interests of agents and shipowners overcomes the interests of the colonies and actually obstructs the attainment of the object in view we find blindness a very common ailment in every department of government and however desirous our rulrs may be to reform every abuse and to adopt useful measures they are often thwarted by the necessity which ought not to exist of conciliating harpies and leeches which devour the public substance and suck the public blood reform has as yet only begun to clean the outside of the platter and it may not reach the inside in our day it is the duty however of all patriots to sharpen the knife that is to cut out corruption from the heart of the commonwealth by means of exposure of every abuse that comes to be known and to support those who are willing to apply it as in a matter of so much importance nothing should be concealed there is no hesitation in stating that it consists with our knowledge that after the emigration committee in van diemen's land detailing the deplorable consequences of sending out young women from workhouses a ship has actually sailed nearly filled up as we have described when any representation is made to a public office the matter is said to belong to another department and that other department says it is not its province to interfere and thus humanity is made the shuttlecock to the battledore of jobbing and the blindness of office if our brethren of the press will take up this the inhuman job will be put an end to emigration mr walter moved pursuant to notice that an humble address be presented to his majesty praying that he will be graciously pleased to issue his royal orders that a placard entitled emigration to van diemen's land which the several postmasters throughout the kingdom have been directed to put in a conspicuous place in their several postoffices and to circulate among the clergy and the parochial authorities be withdrawn he had been assured y several gentlemen who had returned from van diemen's land that many of the young females sent out by the emigration committee had been irrevocable consigned to prostitution and that such as obtained services found themselves placed among a very different calss of persons to that which they had been accustomed to mix with in this country the hon member read an extract from a hobart town paper of the th of february last in which it was stated that some of the females thus launched into the world were not more than twelve of thirteen years old mr wakley seconded the motion sir g grey adverted to the extraordinary object of the address when the information desired had in fact already been given on a former day he hoped whatever information correct or erroneous might be circulated on the subject of emigration that the people of england would not adopt their notions from anonymous paragraphs in hobart town newspapers according to the hon member there was a system in operation by which people were driven out of the country—actually turned out of it as if they were so many slaves now he could declare that there could be no more unfounded statement than this though much good had arisen to the colonies and individuals yet it could not be denied that in some instances youn women had turned out badly they had these facts upon authority—that many of those females obtained respectable places the names of the individuals who obtained them the dates of their arrival the mode of their meployment were all to be found int he papers on the table of the house in conclusion he begged of the hon member and others when statements relative to emigration were made to receive them with caution and reserve mr c lushington defended the proceedigs of the emigration committee he mainted that by their labours the greatest posible good had been accomplished hear hear he would then ask of any one to look at the names of the gentlemen who were on that committee—to look at their characters and could any one who did so believe that the members of that committee would be guilty of the sin of sendng out day after day young females to the colonies—of thus duping those unprotected creatures to their destruction hear hear mr walter replied he had not relied for his statements upon newspapers but upon official documents the motion was negatived without a division state of trade the wool trade london thursday evening—the following are more accurate averages of the sales of colonial wools which have recently taken place than we were enabled to obtain

renwick a fine ship of tons burden this vessel contains emigrants of the following descriptions young married couples having young children young bachelors and young spinsters some of whom are expected to marry on the passage carpenters of maturer age engaged to superintend the erection of forty wooden houses which constitute the principal cargo of the ship south australia we have received the first annual report of new colony of south australia a parliamentary paper presented in june last the site selected for the colony is a part of the south coast of new holland extending two or three hundred miles on each side of spencer's gulf and about miles into the interior it was anticipated that the best central station would be port lincoln at the entrance of spencer's gulf on the west side or nepean bay on the north coast of kangaroo isle port lincoln is in latitude and east longitude about miles right west from sydney the same distance northwest from van diemen's land and about miles eastward of the colony at king george's sound nepean bay is about miles east from port lincoln the colony is established under parliamentary commissioners as an experiment we believe to try whether it may not be possible to execute an extensive plan of emigration without any charge to the country by selling lots of land at such a price as would defray the expense of conveying the emigrants from england the plan adopted is to send out preferably young married persons under thirty and to admit no slaves or convicts into the colony a company has embarked t in the enterprise a surveying vessel was sent out in march to examine the coast carefully that the best site might be chosen at first and the necessity of removal avoided six vessels altogether had sailed down to the st may carrying out male labourers with females and male and females of a superior class these numbers include children the commissioners attempted at first to get s per acre for the land but finding it impossible they reduced the price to s by selling at this price lots consisting each of a country section of acres and a town section of one acre they had raised the t required by the act of parliament as the condition of the grant of land we give these few details to put our readers in a condition to understand the notices which appear from time to time in the papers respecting the colony we hope the commissioners or the adventurers will give the country a distinctive name the title of south australia is bad any way and even positively absurd since australia quasi australasia originally intended for new holland has already begun to be monopolised by van diemen's land the district at spencer's gulf if it is to participated in the general denomination should be termed north rather than south australia by the way most of our colonies in that quarter of the world have ridiculous names as is instantly perceived when we coin a nationa term for the people out of them what can be worse than a van diemenlander a new southwalesian a swan riverite or a kinggeorge's soundian new holland—the government intend to move in the house of commons the grant of t to defray a portion of the charge of an expedition to be despatched for the purpose of exploring the northwest part of new holland agreeably to recommendations of the royal geographical society to ascertain the existence or the contrary of any great river in the northwest portion of new holland religion in australia—an act of council has passed to the effect that whenever t are raised for the erection of a church and parsonage the government may advance the same sum—and that if one hundred adults sign a declaration of their wish for a clergyman a salary of t may be given—if two hundred a salary of t and if five hundred a salary of t already nine clergyman are wanted the midlothian which lately came home from china is at present being fitted up to convey settlers from the isle of skye to australia she has been chartered by government and will acommodate upwards of three hundred emigrants highland emigrants—the ship midlothian has just been fitted up at leith for the reception of highland emigrants which she is to take in at the isle of skye for sydney new south wales these emigrants are we believw to be carried out at a very small cost to themselves the largest portion of the passage money being paid by government out of the land revenue of new south wales which is exclusively appropriated towards the encouragement and promotion of emigration—the objects in view being as well the relief of those districts in this country which are suffering from the want of employment and subsistence as by the introduction into that colony of a body of well disposed and virtuous free emigrant families and individuals the promotion of the moral welfare of the colonists generally the emigrants will we believe receive employment in new south wales as farmservants shepherds overseers &c we had a brief inspection of the midlothian on monday afternoon and found it to be a very fine vessel fitted up in a manner the most comfortable and convenient that could well be effected she sails this afternoon from leith to the isle of skye thus the british government is multiplying its colonies round the shores of new holland exclusive of van diemen's land which forms a separate island we have first on the eastern shore the old settlement of port jackson a second recently formed at port philip miles south from sidney a third just described at st vincent's gulf miles west from port philip a fourth at king george's sound miles west from st vincent's gulf a fifth at swan river miles north from king george's south all these colonies are in the temperate zone between the latitudes of and and will have nearly the same climate we had one at melville island on the north coast within the torried zone in latitude but it was found to be very unhealthy and was abandoned after a short trial ten years ago though the interior of new holland so far as hitherto explored is one of the most barren and unpromising lands in the world there is a margin of good soil round the greater part of its coasts capabale [] of supporting twenty or thirty or fifty millions of inhabitants and there is little doubt that in the course of three centuries it will be the seat of a great and powerful nation cultivating the arts and speaking the language of britain and contributing powerfully to spread civilisation over the southern hemisphere emigration the annual report on emigration just issued contains besides the usual correspondences and documents connected with the plan which has been some time in operation of transferring labourers from india to the mauritius and which it is now proposed to extend to new south wales leaving this subjest for the present we shall state the general results[] of the emigration to canada the report shows that the whole number of emigrants who landed at quebec or montreal in the last nine years was [] averaging very nearly per annum the years of greatest emigration were and the numbers for these years being respectively and the proportions[] [] furnished by the three kingdoms in the nine years were as follows —among eight emigrants there were five irishmen two englishmen and one scotsman scotland in proportion to its population has sent off three times as many emigrants and ireland about nine times as may as england and it should be added that a certain part of the emigration from england is artificial consisting of paupers sent out at the expense of their parishes emigrations offers the most natural practicable and safe means of relieving a country of its redundant or unemployed population and it may be asked why it is so much less resorted to in england than in scotland and ireland it cannot[] be the ignorance of the english for this would lead to the inference that the irish who emigrate in the largest numbers were the best informed of the three nations it is we apprehend nothing but the poor laws which hold out to the labourer the certainty of a subsistence at home however idle or improvident he may be and render him averse to live in the colonies where he would have no such resource this is only one of the many evils which these laws have produced not only to the country at large but to the labouring classes themselves whose average condition was greatly deteriorated while only a fraction of their number shared the benefit of the allowance we speak of the poor laws as they existed before the act of was passed the number of emigrants who went to canada last year was of whom went from scotland from england from ireland and from nova scotia newfoundland or the west indies in the number of emigrants was the ports in scotland from which the greatest numbers sail are greenock leith aberdeen and cromarty of the emigrants in settled in lower canada in upper canada went to the united states and ninetytwo died in the hospital or quarantine station in the same period of nine years [] british emigrants have landed at new york or fully per annum on average there is a great fluctua[] tion in the number in and it was only in it was in no less than and addingthe who went to canada no less than persons must have landed at new york and quebec from the british isles in [] there is a discrepancy however between this account and another in a different return also newly published the report of the agentgeneral for emigration makes the number who went to the united states from britain in only the former probably comprehends all british born subjects including persons from nova scotia canada and the west indies and probably all passengers many of whom returned the agentgeneral gives the number of persons who emigrated to the british colonies and the united states for every year since we present merely the average for the last year seven years annual number of emigrants from britain to north american colonies [] ditto do to united states [] ditto do to cape of good hope [] ditto do to australian colonies [] [][] in the number who emigrated to these colonies was no less than the number who went out to australia in was much greater than in any preceding year being if we assume that each emigrant pays for his passage &c or has in his pocket t the average net[] expended on emigration will be about two millions per annum it may be correctly stated now that human beings form no inconsiderable item in number and value of our exports in the case of ireland we suppose it is by far the most flourishing and by no means the least advantageous branch of the national commerce the annual increment of the population of british isles is about independently of the efflux by emigration but including this it must be about it follows that there are about [] more inhabitants in the country each day than there were on the day before of the additional mortals[] emigration carries off the establishment of steam navigation across the atlantic will no doubt give a new impulse to the circulation of human beings while the construction of railroads across the alleganies and of canals in canada will greatly increase the capacity of the western world to absorb the imported multitudes in seven years hence the journey from london to missouri will be shorter in point of time and perhaps cheaper than the journey from washington to missouri was seven years ago a religious man might see something like the finger of providence in the fact that just at the time france germany the netherlands and switzerland begin to feel severely the pressure of a redundant population inventions have started into existence which may be said to annihilate space and bring the most thinly inhabited parts of the world into juxtaposition with the most overpeopled from the american almanac we find that the number of passengers who arrived in the united states in was of whom were native americans the proportion of emigrants from the different foreign countries was— from the british isles british american colonies germany france prussia switzerland denmark holland mexico texas cuba other countries some curious inferences might be drawn from this table as to the motives which induce men to leave their native country celeris paribus there is most emigration where there is most intelligence thus spain portugal sardinia naples the papal states and austria furnish no emigrants to american while britain and germany furnish a vast number much however must depend on the domestic condition of the country and on the greater or less facilities for removing thus considering its inland position and the small number of its inhabitants the spirit of emigration must be much more active in switzerland which sends out persons than in france which sends out the magistrates of new york it appears consider the influx of emigrants a nuisance and it would seem from an expression of mr buchanan's the agent at quebec that they had laid a tax of ten dollars upon all who arrive with an intention of settling the key to this proceeding is no doubt to be found in the following facts a board of aldermen reported in june last that the expense of city almshouses in the preceding year were dollars or t that of persons admitted in a certain period were aliens and that the whole number under the charge of the commissioners was of whom threefourths were foreigners a communication from the mayor at the same time says— nearly emigrants arrive each week our streets are filled with the wandering crowds of those passengers clustering in our city unaccustomed to our climate without money without employment without friends many not speaking our language without any dependence for food or rainment[] or fireside in boston and philadelphia also nearly onehalf of the inmates of the almshouses were foreigners emigration to australia—several vessels have sailed within the last three weeks for our settlements in the souther hemisphere with full cargoes of goods and a large number of passengers the south australian packetship orleana will carry out nearly passengers many of the emigrants are capitalists and some to a considerable amount general flinter—we are sorry to learn by our letters from madrid that a very brave and deserving officer general flinter committed suicide on the th instant in that city general flinter was an irishman of good family he served under the duke of wellington in portugal and spain and was one of the many officers who joined the portuguese and spanish armies by permission of our government—morning post the king of prussia and his catholic sub jects—the german courier in an article date berlin th instant refers to the late arrests in posen and accuses the catholic clergy of stimulating their flocks to revolt the prussian government had in consequence increased its exertions to conciliate the court of rome in hopes that its influence would be exercised over the clergy and induce them to return to their allegiance on the other hand the sect of separatists who had resolved to emigrate from austria to australia because of the interference of government with their religious belief amounted to souls it was said they would be joined by a great number of the inhabitants of pomerania commission of the general assembly on wednesday the commission of assembly met in the tolbooth church—dr muir moderator in the chair the presbyterian church in new south wales —the moderator recalled to the notice of the commission that on a former meeting they had directed him to write to lord glenelg secretary for the colonies disavowing connection with dr lang in new south wales and blaming his proceedings in that colony in separating himself from the presbytery there formed in connection with the church of scotland since that time he had had a communication from lord glenelg which he was sure would be received by the commission with great satisfaction the communication from lord glenelg was then read it consisted of a copy of the despatch transmitted to the governor of new south wales approving of his conduct in withholding the salaries of the presbyterian laymen who had not submitted themselves to the authority of the presbytery in connection with the church of scotland and further directing that dr lang's salary should be discontinued his lordship explained that in doing this the government had no wish to constitute themselves judges in any ecclesiastical disputes but as the salaries awarded to these gentlemen had been given on the faith that they were to remain in connection with the church of scotland they could not be continued so long as they defied her authority on the motion of mr dunlop the commission unanimously expressed their satisfaction with the promptitude and decision which the government had shown in the matter and directed the moderator to communicate their minute to lord glenelg it was also agreed to reappoint the committee to watch over the farther proceedings especially as it was understoof that dr lang was now on his way to this country case of small isles—the commission then proceeded to take up the case of small isles which it will be recollected arose out of the rev mr m'lean having as was alleged appeared in the lobby of the assembly house while that court was sitting in may last in a state of intoxication the case occupied the court a considerable part of the day and at the evening sederunt the following motion by dr gardner was unanimously agreed to—that the commission having considered the evidence on the record find that in as far as that evidence is hearsay it is inadmissable but find it proved that on the afternoon of friday the th of may last mr m'lean was seen in a state of intoxication in the vestibule of the general assembly attempting to force his way into it that it is proved he was on two other occasions during the sitting of last assembly in a state of intoxication and therefore they find that he ought to be deposed from the office of the holy ministry and direct the moderator accordingly to pronounce the sentence of deposition directing the clerk to transmit an extract of the sentence to the presbytery of skye and them to declare the parish of small isles vacant—the moderator pronounced from the chair the sentence os deposition case of lethendy—in the course of the proceedings during the early sederunt of the commission the procurator rose and said he might take the present opportunity of stating to the commission that within the last three or four days a petition and complaint had been given in to the court of session and appointed to be served at the instance of mr clark presentee to the parish of lethendy against the presbytery of dunkeld and mr kessen whom that presbytery had lately inducted into that charge in despite of interdicts issued by the court of session he mentioned the fact to that commission presuming that they would authorize him to defend the presbytery who had acted under authority of the commission itself mr buchanan of glasgow after some remarks in commendation of the firmness of the presbytery in carrying through the settlement amidst many difficulties moved that the commission sanction the procurator's defending the presbytery in the trying circumstances in which they are placed and resolve that they will to the utmost of their power encourage and support them under whatsoever difficulties they may be subjected by their execution of the sentence of the commission and that the thanks of the commission be given to the presbytery for the decision and temperate firmness with which they have practically maintained the rightful authority and jurisdiction of the church dr bryce said he was quite unprepared for any motion on this subject but with the views which he entertained in regard to this case it was impossible he could concur in the motion proposed and he must therefore dissent from it mr james bridges expressed great indignation against mr clark for thus bidding defiance to the authority of the church courts and he proposed that for thus trampling on the rights and dignity of the church mr clark should be forthwith called before the commission for an exemplary punishment—mr dunlop suggested that although he concurred in feeling with mr bridges it would be premature at present to take any steps against mr clark inasmuch as there was no official communication on the subject from the presbytery of dunkeld mr makgill recommended to mr bridges for this reason not to press his motion declaring that as at this time years ago eight bishops had been deposed he trusted the time was not far distant when mr clark would receive a similar reward for his misconduct and mr m said emphatically that whatever the presbytery of dunkeld might suffer for upholding the independence of the church he as a member of commission by whose orders they had acted would be proud to bear his share mr bridges then intimated that he would waive pressing his motion and mr buchanan's was adopted dr bryce and mr w malcolm intimating their dissent on the ground that it was incompetent and inexpedient for the commission to adopt such a resolution commemoration of the second centenary of the celebrated assembly at glasgow—in the course of the day the moderator suggested that as this was the second centenary of the great assembly at glasgow which might be considered as the founder not only of their ecclesiastical but of their civil liverties a meeting should be held exclusively devoted to prayer and thanksgiving to almighty god for the benefits conferred on their zion at seven o'clock accordingly several of the members and a considerable number of people assembled when an hour was spent in devotional exercises which were conducted by drs muir lee and dickson in succession the commission adjourned to the second tuesday in

misery and proved fully at least to our satisfaction that a powerful and efficacious remedy was applicable in the objects of the meeting the subject seemed to tell powerfully on the meeting the

themselves highly gratified with their accommodation the owners messrs andrew steward & co spared no expense which might add to the comfort of the emigrants and the kind of attentions of mr adamson colonization company's agent were much appreciated by them all [] a man shot—on tuesday evening a deliverate attempt at murder by shooting took palce at greenock a young man from edinburgh an intended emigrant for new south wales by the palmyra drew from his pocked a pistol and shot in the head a person who had been appointed by his friends to see him on board and to look to his affairs before the sailing of the vessel the wounded man was taken to the infirmary in a very dangerous state and the assailant to the jail it appears that the young man has for some time past been behaving in a manner which made his friends chary of intrusting him with money in this country and that they had employed the individual referred to to see him on board for australia before leaving any under his charge this indignity is supposed to have lain heavy on his mind and led to the commission of the act above recorded—ibid first scotch colony for new zealand—a numerous party of emigrants under this title

in new south wales—dr gordon as convener of the committee to whom the dissensions that at present existed among the presbyterian churches in australia had been remitted by last commission stated that the committee had prepared a report but that since it was made up several important documents had come to hand which in justice to dr lang ought to be considered he therefore asked leave to delay the

consisting of the husband wife and six of a young family sold off their effects and came to leith for the purpose of availing themselves of this opportunity to settle in the above colony on applying

them the highest credit have temporarily supplied their wants but the hands of private charity is soon crippled and unless something else be immediately done we may have soon to report one or more of

pursuant to a requisition to the lord mayor for the purpose of petitioning her majesty and both houses of parliament to adopt prompt and efficient measures for preserving from invasion or abandonment the longestablished sovereignty of the british crown in the islands of new zealand at present endangered by foreign pretensions and by the acts of the executive government also for stopping the course of lawless emigration and settlement which has not only proved deeply injurious to the native people of the country but threatens their speedy extermination and lastly for establishing the most beneficial system of colonization and the protection and restraints of british law under a distinct colonial government in place of the state of anarchy which now prevails among both races and all other classes of her majesty's subjects and others inhabiting or resorting to new zealand as a distant independency of the territory of new south wales including the gentlemen of the hustings the entire number might be calculated at individuals the lord mayor took the chair resolutions in accordance with the object of the meeting were moved and seconded by mr g palmer mp mr f baring mp mr hawes mp mr g f young mr ward mp and others on the motion of mr g robinson seconded by mr donaldson a petition was adopted by the meeting to be presented to the queen by the earl of devon to the house of peers by lord ashburton and to the commons by lord eliot new zealand—name of the capital city it will gratify the admirers of the duke of wellington to learn that the directors of the new zealand company have resolved that the name of the city founded by colonel wakefield lambton harbour port nicholson and which is destined to become the capital of new zealand shall be named the city of wellington in honour of the illustrious duke the duke is a great advocate for colonization and to him the promoters of colonization of south australia were in a great measure indebted for securing the enactment of the statute which gave effect to the principles on which that colony is founded and as many of the promoters of south australian emigration are directors of the new zealand company they have resolved setting all party politics aside to confer this honour on the duke there could be no stronger proof of the political sagacity and statesmanlike views of the duke than his approval of the wakefield system of colonization and no better mode of perpetuating his name than by bestowing it on the metropolis of the great britain of the southern hemisphere deputation of distressed weavers—the distress of the paisley weavers has caused them to send a deputation to london which on tuesday waited on lord john russell to solicit the means of transporting themselves out of the ungrateful country which has been enriched by their toils and in return refuses them the means of subsistence their prayer was to be sent to new zealand the answer was that government will next session bring forward some general measure on the subject but in the mean time cannot help them literature narrative of a whaling voyage round the globe &c &c by frederick debell bennett esq frgs vols london richard bentley we have been somewhat disappointed in these volumes we expected to have found them like scoresby's full of interesting details regarding whale fishing whereas there is hardly a word on the subject throughout the whole of the first volume and very little in the second in fact what there is is confined to a sort of supplementary appendix this is the more strange that one of the chief purposes of the author as he himself informs us in undertaking this voyage was to investigate the anatomy and habits of southern whales and the mode of conducting the sperm whale fishery subjects which he remarks were then untouched by the literature of any country yet in the work itself this chief purpose dwindles into one of very secondary prominence this the readers of the work at least most of them will the more regret on finding how very curious and interesting are the two or three chapters which the author has given on the subject of south sea whaling there are full of entertaining details of both a popular and scientific character and cannot be read without exciting a wish that larger portion of the work had been composed of such material in making these remarks however we are far from intending to depreciate the sort of information in the shape chiefly of sketches of the south sea islands to which the greater part of the volumes are devoted we mean merely to say that it is not what we expected from the title of the work nor we may add what for our own reading we should have preferred yet are these sketches very amusing reading—full of graphic descriptions and curious details of native character which is still found in the south sea islands in a state of very primitive simplicity we have frequently seen says mr bennett amongst the congregagation assembled at church in raiatea a native clothed in nothing but a shirt another with a beaver hat surmounting a person naked except the scanty maro and a third whose whole attire was a black coat white neckerchief and a shirt we observe a rather odd circumstance noted by mr bennett he says that the temperate ships of america are the principal purveyors of ardent spirits to the natives of the south sea islands carrying large quantities of rum thither for the purposes of traffic this is placing the temperance principle in a somewhat curious predicament another remark of the author's not less striking—mark it well and take comfort from it ye bon vivants[] of the civilzed world—is that disease is as abundant amongst the native islanders as amongst the most refined of their species and from this concludes that man in his savage state is as liable to the ills that flesh is heir to as in his civilised condition dr johnson made a similar remark regarding the highlanders of scotland alleging that the london alderman lived as long over his turtle feast as the highlander over his paten cake what degree of fellowfeeling with civic dignitary and his good living or whether any dictated this remark of the learned doctor we cannot say mr bennett's work is written with great ability and in style whose only fault is exhibited in a tendency occasionally to the use of rather learned phraseology we conclude with an extract from that portion of the work which from its great interest we regretted was not larger but which limited as it is is so full of curious information and so crowded with remarkable incident as to render the selection by no means an easy task some sperm whales appear reluctant to employ their tail when attacked but prove active and dangerous with their jaws such individuals often rather seek than avoid the attacking boats and rushing upon them with open mouth employ every possible art to crush them with their teeth and if successful will sometimes continue in their neighbourhood biting the wreck and oars into small fragments when thus threatening a boat the whale usually turns and swings upon its back and will sometimes act in a very sluggish and unaccountable manner keeping its formidable lower jaw suspended for some moments over the boat in a threatening attitude but ultimately rolling to one side and closing its mouth harmlessly nor is it rare to observe this whale when pursued and attacked retain[] its mouth in an expanded state for some minutes together such threatening demonstrations of the jaw as well as some others with the flukes occasionally compel a boat's crew to leap into the water and support themselves by swimming or clinging to oars until the danger has passed in the year the ship pusie hall encountered a fighting whale which after injuring and driving off her four boats pursued them to the ship and withstood for some time the lances hurled at it by the crew from the bows of the vessel before in could be induced to retire in this affair a youth in one of the boats was destroyed by a blow from the whale and one of the officers was severely lacerated by coming in contact with the animal's jaw a highly tragical instances of the power and ferocity occasionally displayed by the sperm whale is recorded in the fate of the american southseaman essex captain g pollard this vessel when cruising in the pacific ocean in the year was wrecked by a whale under the following extraordinary circumstances the boats had been lowered in pursuit of a school of whales and the ship was attending them to windward the master and second mate were engaged with whales they had harpooned in the midst of the school and the chief mate had returned on board to equip a spare boat in lieu of his own which had been broken and rendered unserviceable while the crew were thus occupied the lookout at the masthead reported that a large whale was coming rapidly down upon the ship the mate hastened his task in the hope that he might be ready in time to attack it the cachalot which was of the largest size consequently a male and probably the guardian of the school in the meanwhile approached the ship so closely that the although the helm was put up to avoid the contact he struck her a severe blow which broke off a portion of her keel the enraged animal was then observed to retire to some distance and again rush upon the ship with extreme velocity his enormous head struck the starboard bow beating in a corresponding portion of the planks and the people on board had barely time to take to their boats before the ship filled with water and fell over on her side she did not sink however for some hours and the crew in the boats continued near the wreck until they had obtained a small supply of provisions when they shaped a course for land but here it is to be regretted they made a fatal error at the time the accident happened they were cruising on the equator in the longitude of about [] degrees west with the marquesan and society islands on their lee and might have sailed in their boats to either of those groups in a comparatively short time under an erroneous impression however that all those lands were inhabited by an inhospitable race of people they preferred pulling to windward for the coast of peru and in the attempt were exposed for a lengthened period in extreme privations a few cachalots have been noted individually as animals dangerous to attack one was thus distinguished on the cruising ground off the coast of new zealand and was long know to whalers by the name of 'new zealand tom' he is said to have been of great size conspicuously distinguished by a white hump and famous for the havoc he had made amongst the boats and gear of ships attempting his destruction a second example of cimilar celebrity was known to whalers in the straits of timor he had so often succeeded in repelling the attacks of his foes as to be considered invincible but was at length despatched by a whaler who forewarned of his combative temper adopted the expedient of floating a cask on the sea to withdraw his attention from the boats but notwithstanding this ruse the animal was not destroyed without much hard fighting nor until the bow of one of the boats had been nipped off by his jaws emigration—there are at present at the port of london alone no fewer than twentythree

amounts to t s d amongst the subscriptions we notice t from the wesleyan chapel at adelaide south australia emigration to new zealand—the chartists again from the glasgow argus on monday night a public meeting chiefly composed of the working classes was held in the justiciary court hall glasgow for the purpose of memorializing lord john russell in favour of obtaining the lord provost in the chair the hall was crowded to excess and it was perfectly evident from the first that the chartists had mustered in great strength to carry out their usual course of obstruction to the particular business of the evening—mr t gillespie proposed a resolution in favour of emigration to new zealand through the medium of funds raised by the sale of lands in the colony and addressed the meeting at some length in support of the resolution—mr r malcolm jun a young lad and a chartist spouter after a long speech proposed an amendment to the effect that while the meeting was favourable to emigration to new zealand or any other part of the world by those so disposed they objected to any application being made for a grant of public money for any such purpose—that they were opposed to the question of emigration being allowed to occupy public attention &c and concluded with the statement that emigration would not afford even temporary relief to the oppressed operatives and that bad laws were the chief cause of all their present sufferings &c this amendment which was supported by the most trifling arguments we ever heard brought forward in public was of course loudly cheered by the chartists the lord provost repeatedly explained that he had agreed to take the chair on the understanding that the subject of emigration to new zealand was to occupy the attention but here a matter perfectly foreign to the business for which they were convened was introduced by way of amendment there was an attack made upon the general policy of the country—and he had positively to state that if such an amendment was carried he would not remain in the chair this was received by cries for a new chairman and much confusion one party cheering and the other hissing and yelling alternately during the greater part of the evening a discussion followed in which a boy named jack took a prominent part and it became perfectly evident that the chartist speakers were woefully ignorant of the subject they had the impudence to discuss it was gravely and indignantly averred that by going to new zealand the working men would incur the risk of being swallowed by cannibals till informed of the contrary the chartists seemed to think that the means of emigration were to be supplied from the public exchequer and when told that the funds were to be raised by the sale of lands in new zealand one of them sagely observed that it would be much more humane and just to appropriate the proceeds of those sales of land to employ it in sending out emigrants another favourite argument was that every person had a right to subsist in the land that gave him birth and that it was barbarous and cruel to send a man however wretched out of his native country also that emigration would produce no benefit to society at home as the places of those sent off would soon be filled by others of course if these arguments had always been held good and acted upon the whole human family would to this day have been crowded together in the cradle of our race in the east provided only the thing had been possible the extension of mankind to other parts of the world must have been wicked and cruel and useless—for for every inhabitant of a country is entitled to a subsistence in the land that gave him birth and on his removal to another land his place would just be filled by others the above is a mere specimen of the worse than childish arguments used by the chartist spouters and which the men who are now knocking loudly at the door of the constitution for admission cheered as if they had been fraught with the choicest wisdom —mr john crawford secretary to the new zealand land company endeavoured by some sensible remarks to place the question of emigration to new zealand on its proper footing but in vain they were determined to have the charter only—and till then starving workmen willing but unable to emigrate must starve on on a division the amendment proposed by mr malcolm was carried by a large majority and after a vote of thanks had been given to the lord provost the meeting broke up this was not done however till the chartists were called upon to be at their posts at the meeting to be held today to address the queen—to render themselves of course a little more odious by another stretch of their obstructive power—if they can on monday a discussion of some interest took place in the house of commons relative to the affairs of south australia owing to certain defects in its government that colony has fallen into a state of financial embarassment requiring immediate relief lord john russell traced the history of the settlement from its foundation and stated that while its revenue does not exceed t its expenditure has increased to the enormous sum of t a year at present its affairs are managed by commissioners the responsible ministers of the crown having no direct control over its expenditure this is manifestly an evil and must form the subject of future legislation but in the meantime it is necessary to provide for the payment of certain bills now overdue accordingly lord john russell proposed that her majesty should be authorized to guarantee a loan of t for this purpose lord stanley concurred generally in the views of the noble secretary for the colonies but though that the government ought not to demand a loan until they had brought in a bill to explain distinctly the principles on which they proposed that the colony should henceforth be governed sir robert peel suggested that the government should ask a vote of credit for the sum required which as it met the urgency of the case was ultimately agreed upon and the subject was deferred till friday new south wales mr grote rose to move a series of resolutions in condemnation of the application of a part of the land and emigration fund of new south wales to the maintenance of gaols and police in that colony it was in that this expense antecedently borne by the home government was for the first time thrown upon the colony whose revenues were then found to yield considerable surplus of revenue beyond expenditure the charge so imposed at that time was calculated to be about t a year and had that been all the colony would have borne it without a murmur but in fact it had ever since averaged nearly t it was not reasonable to impose such a charge on the colony on account of gaols and police constituted not the ordinary uses of a colonial society but for the peculiar purposes of our transportation system the argument urged by the home government was that the expense was chiefly caused by the extensive distribution of convicts by assignment throughout the colony whose settlers drew a proportional profit from the labour so assigned but that assignment was a gain not more to the colonists who obtained the labour than to the mother country which saved the expense of maintaing the labourers whatever value the mother country might be entitled to claim for the labour of the convicts ought in strictness to fall not on the colony at large but on the individual employers and if there were valid reasons against an exaction of premium from them still it was unjust to throw the obligation upon the colony at large that was to pay private wages out of public rates this one charge on the oclony was sufficient on account for all that embarassment in its finances which had been growing for the last six years it had been enabled to defray the impact only by resorting to the emigration fund and thus checking emigration itself no less than t had been abstracted from that fund to meet these costs of jails and police the diversion of that fund from emigration was a great evil both to the colony where labour is so pressingly needed and to the poor of this country to whom that refuge is so material he considered the emigration fund as held by the government in trust for the united intersts of the colony and of the mother country the great extent of sales of land in the colony had been [] owing to the belief of the colonists that the proceed[] would be applied to emigration the hon member was proceeding to cite the opinions of various persons in favour of this strict application when a motion was made to count the house and it adjourned for want of its quorum[] of members we have received a copy of a series of resolutions passed on the d of october by the legislative council of new south wales on the subject of immigration into colony the object of these resolutions is to encourage emigration from the mother country by showing the demand for labour in new south wales and the advantages offered to the immigrant we have only room for a few of the more important resolutions resolved that there exists throughout the colony an urgent and increasing want of working hands in every branch of industry that there is ample employment for emigrants at highly renumerating wages without the interruption in this mild climate experienced in colder countries during the winter months and that even during the worst period of the past severe drought no persons able and willing to work found any difficult in procuring advantageous employment resolved that in the opinion of this council there can be no more advantageous field for the employment of industry than is presented in new south wales—experience proving that ablebodied sober industrious and careful emigrants may within a few years after their arrival rise form the condition of labourers to be themselves employers of labour by which process and by the progressive increase of the flocks and herds of the colony a constant demand for additional labourers is created sufficient to remove all apprehension of a dearth of employment for as many as may arise resolved that this council would particularly instance the large and increasing sums at the credit of the working classes in the savings bank of new south wales as affording gratifying evidence of their prosperous condition the deposits having increased from t the amount on st december to t on st august resolved that great additional advantage must accrue to the mother country from the large consumption in this colony of british produce and manufactures the declared value of which from to according to the official returns for that period amounted to more than eight millions sterling having progressively increased from t the amount in to t in whilst the exports from the colony including the produce of the fisheries increased from t in the former year to t in the latter—the total amount being t for the whole period resolved that the trade between the mother country and this colony together with the whale fisheries in the adjourning seas also affords a valuable nursery for seamen important in this respect in proportion to the distance from great britain and calculated to strengthen and secure her maritime power and that this field for the employment of british shipping must increase with the growing prosperity of the colony—considerations which appear to this council to constitute a strong additional claim on the part of the colony to the fostering care of the british government emigration to new zealand—on friday the tyne left the london dock and proceeded down the river on her voyage to port nicholson new zealand the tyne is a fine new vessel and she takes out mechanics and labourers with their families from the emigration depot at deptford besides a number of other passengers amongst whom are mr swainson chief justice and mr martin attorneygeneral of the new colony to which sations

will be provided with a large proportion of their provisions fresh a great quantity of patent preserved provisions being shipped for that purpose on board the tyne there are a greater number of

on inspection to be among the most interesting features of the picture the groups of perishing beings are exquisitely wrought while everything is made to contribute to the terrific grandeur of the

contrast these pictures present to each other—the one fearful beyond expression the other exhibiting a heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the eye rests with delight there are several other valuable paintings in this collection amongst which is the offering up of isaac a rembrandt in fine preservation gordon's british diorama—this beautiful exhibition opened on saturday last and has we understand been crowded with visitors ever since it will be seen by mr gordon's advertisement in today's paper that the view of the tower of london during the recent conflagration to which we alluded in our last has now arrived and is being exhibited along with the other views broughtonplace congregation—we understand that the call given by broughtonplace congregation to the rev mr croon sanquhar

idea of his track than the previous article copied from the athenean[] afforded south victoria land which he discovered extends in latitude from south to how much farther is unknown and in longitude its eastern coast lies between and its position is directly south from new zealand and at the distance of geographical miles the length of the part seen was fully miles it was girt with a border of ice many miles in breadth which rendered it inaccessible the passage southward was closed at latitude by a barrier of ice feet high which was traced for miles east from victoria land icebergs were encountered in numbers after they passed parallel of and pack ice at the land rose in lofy peaks from to feet in height perfectly covered with eternal snow the glaciers descended from near the mountain summits project many miles into the ocean and presented a perpendicular face of lofty cliffs they could not reach the mainland but landed on an island which they found to consist of volcanic rocks on th january in latitude longitude e they discovered a magnificent volcano emitting smoke and flame in a splendid profusion and named it mount erebus an extinct one near it was named after the other vessel mount terror at the distance of less than half a mile from the ice cliffs which barred their progress southward they had soundings with fathoms these cliffs no doubt reached the bottom and including the feet above water must have had an elevation fo feet of thereabout the observations on the dip and declination induced them to place the south magnetic pole in latitude and east longitude and they considered its position as well ascertained as if they had reached it though their nearest approach to it was a point miles from it on the east coast of victoria land the pole is probably within that region though this cannot be positively affirmed as its western boundary is unknown the highest latitude they reached they were therefore only degrees from the pole and about degrees nearer to it than captain weddel[] the most successful of their predecessors the nonintrusion disclosures—in the advertiser of yesterday there is a letter from j m hog esq of newliston and another from the rev dr simpson of kirknewton both expressing their extreme surprise at the letter of mr hamilton which appeared in our last and strongly disclaiming all connexion with it on the part of the general assembly's committee sabbath observance—the sweetie case —we understand that the government of prussia thinking that the mode of keeping the sabbath in that country was in some respects too lax recently sent over a person to this country to learn whether our practise in britain would not furnish hints for improvement unluckily the very first specimens of our piety which met him were the sweetie case and that of the poor man key who was excommunicated for burying his child on sunday these will of course figure in the very front of the officer's report as the natural fruits of our system and we may guess what their effect will be in reconciling the germans to a stricter observance of sunday we can moreover inform butters' prosecutors that the fame of their exploits has already travelled by the aid of the teutonic newspapers to the uttermost parts of germany to the infinite amusement of the swabian farmers the saxon miners and the shepherds of the riesengeberge key's case is

ask the presbytery to sustain the presentation with relative papers at that meeting but he intimated that he intended to appear at the next meeting which is appointed to be held on the d of february and he expected to be able to show that the presbytery should then sustain the presentation and relative documents splendid meteor—on tuesday evening about eight o'clock a meteor of unusal size and splendour was witnessed in this quarter the evening was very clear the sky being without a cloud and the moon shining brightly suddenly a dazzling blaze of light burst from the sky illuminating benlomond and the distant hills the curse around craigforth and indeed the earth and air on every side as far as the eye could reach with all the brilliancy of noonday the phenomenon appeared like a ball of fire of an oblong shape and apparently almost twice the size of the moon having at the time somewhat of the same silvery appearance as that luminary but flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to dazzle the eyes a tail of fire somewhat resembling that of a rocket but composed of the most beautifully varied colours streamed behind it for a short distance adding much to its spendour and giving the whole an appearance at once singularly magnificent and sublime before it disappeared it assumed a red glowing appearance and then burst for an instant enveloping the earth and sky in a blaze as bright and dazzling as the most vivid lightning it appeared to pass from the south to the north inclining towards the earth to the eye it seemed to burst and disappeared above gargunnock another meteor of the same kind but much less in size brilliancy and splendour was observed falling in a quartr rather farther to the south a few minutes previously it is a coincidence worthy of

sentenced tothirty days' imprisonment in paisley house of correction with hard labour as rogues and vagabonds and an active lookout is made by the police for the remainder of the gang stoppage of payments by the town of paisley—partly on account of the great depression of trade and partly on account of a run raised by the circulation of malicious and false statements regarding the affairs of

in realizing the outstanding debts due to the community for the regular payment of the interest on the money borrowed and other current engagements of the burgh it is pretty generally known that a small portion of the wouldbepolitical leaders of the town who have not the influence to get themselves placed in municipal authority have for a good number of years endeavoured to embarass the party in power by attacking the credit of the community the unfavourabout state of trade and the leniency of the council in not enforcing during the last year the exactions on the owners of property for entries &c falling due caused a deficiency of nearly t in the usual amount of revenue this simple circumstance was taken advantage of though nothing was lost thereby and statements prejudicial to the town's credit were placed in the hands of every credito that could be found by the individuals referred to and thus uncalled for alarm raised in addition to this the adherents of the same party in the council during the last five days gave currency to another statement which they knew to be quite untrue about the late provost having commenced to secure himself by drawing a thousand pounds when the fact was he had not drawn out a penny from the position to which which the affiars the town are now driven a full and public exposure of these matters will soon be submitted to the creditors the council have been negotiating for such a loan of money as will pay off those who are dissatisfied which in the ordinary state of the money market they would long since have obtained though at present that is difficult as regards risk to the creditors from the best informed quarters we are assured there is none more than onethird of the whole debts of the town are due to the bank and the members of council or their immediate friends and fully a half of the debt against the river is due to the same parties this we should conceive the strongest proof that could be adduced of the confidence of those who should best know the state of the town's affairs—glasgow chronicle disgraceful trick—at a late wake in the country a short way from crieff a waggish fellow tied a cord secretly to the neck

independent power of the church were secured now this liberum arbitrium does nothing at all for nonintrusion but it does a great deal for church independence it confers no privilege on the laity but it adds immeasurably to the power of the clergy it is in fact the very worst part of the claims that have been advanced by the church and its effects would simply be to sacrifice the lay nonintrusionists on the one hand and clerical moderates on the other it means literally uncontrolled power to the church the general steam navigation company's ship monarch captain fraser arrived at

it was submitted to the late ministers who referred it to the commissioners of emigration and the lords of the admiralty by both of whom it was approved rules were prepared by the commissioners of emigration a vote of t was put into the estimates for the first year's expense and we suppose passed if steps have not been taken already to send out emigrants we presume they will be taken about the beginning of next winter which is their summer these islands are about miles from the south extremity of the american continent in a latitude corresponding with that of london their climate however very closely resembles that of shetland they have cold summers and mild winters snow seldom lies in them but owing to their humidity and want of sunshine and the stormy winds which blow almost constantly wheat of barley could not be raised in them and even oats might turn out to be a precarious crop it is doubted also if wood will grow and at present there is not a single tree in the islands turnips and potatoes succeed well and there is an abundance of good grass upon which some thousands of black cattle horses and hogs thrive in the wild state and sheep have been introduced and found to do well extensive peatbogs exist which will afford a sufficient supply of fuel the present population consists of twentyfive persons young and old—onehalf of them british the other gauchos south american indians of a semicivilised description they are all stationed at portlouis a fine natural harbour where a british officer resides the islands are numerous but all very small except two whose area is estimated at square miles or nearly half the extent of scotland they are deeply perforated by arms of the sea and probably afford a greater number of fine natural harbours than any country of equal extent in the world their shores afford excellent fish of many kinds and seals are exceedingly numerous the great object in establishing a colony here is to provide a harbour of refuge and place of refitment for our ships frequenting the south seas which are yearly increasing in number every vessel going to the pacific ocean or coming from it passes within sight of these islands or near them at present or british ships pass these islands annually coming from chili or peru and more engaged in the whale fishery the trade to new south wales employs vessels most of which return to england by this route which will also be preferred by vessels trading to new zealand van diemen's land port philip and probably south australia from sydney or hort town the distance is nearly the same by cape horn or the cape of good hope but the prevalence of westerly winds in the parallel beyond the th renders the latter route the more advantageous on the outward voyage and the former on the return the falkland islands are about half as distant from britain as new south wales the emigration board recommend that government should send out two surveyors to select an eligible site for a town and to lay out the land in blocks of half a square mile which may be subdivided it is proposed to sell the land to emigrants at s per acre and to expend part of the money in carrying out additional settlers part in defraying the colonial outlay there are wild cattle in the largest island the privilege of shooting which or catching and taming them might be sold to the settlers or a company the climate is uninviting but there is little doubt that persons accustomed to grazing or sheep farming or to sealhunting or deepsea fishery might drive a profitable trade here a vast number of ships making long voyages american french dutch as well as british pass the islands and to these it would be a great accommodation to find supplies of provisions and the means of refitting here some of our starving population in the north of scotland or the islands might better their circumstances by removing to the falkland islands new zealand from the morning chronicle the dinner given on saturday by the new zealand company to lord john russell will serve to remove all apprehensions if any are yet entertained with regard to the relations between that colony and the government of the parent state many of the first names in the country honoured this splendid banquet by their presence and men of all parties tories whigs and radicals appeared to be actuated only by one common feeling the public are now tolerably familiar with the natural advantages of new zealand which appears destined to be in the souther ocean what great britain is in the northern lord ashburton with must felicity observed that the position of the new zealand islands on the map their climate fertility abundant harbours surrounded with the seas most suited to the whale fisheries and above all the character to the native population led him to anticipate that these islands were likely to become the great seat of wealth and naval power lord john russell was justly complimented on all hands for adding these important islands to the great colonial empire of this country the speech of lord john russell was much and deservedly applauded i believe said his lordship that the foundation of this colony of new zealand will tend to the honour and dignity of the crow and will tend to the prosperity and future greatness of the nation cheers it was on this ground and for these reasons that i lent my humble efforts in support of those exertions that had been made and were about to be made by the new zealand company gentlemen in so doing i should be unworthy of your approbation if i took any extraordinary merit to myself for in the first place the principle of colonization the value of colonies to this country the means they afford of augmenting her strength of adding to her power of promoting her wealth and of increasing her prosperity—all this has been ascertained and demonstrated by the enlightened discussions of past years hear hear with regard to the best mode of colonization likewise we have had the advantage and assistance of the most enlightened opinions and the most adverse discussion i therefore can only take to myself the merit of not being blind to the importance and value of those opinions and discussions hear and cheers but though his lordship speaks thus humbly of his own merits in recommending the adoption of these islands by the crown it was perfectly well understood by all present that for his conduct with respect to his colony he has truly entitled himself to the gratitude of his country lord ashburton only paid him a deserved tribute when he complimented him for the sagacity with which he had appreciated the importance of these islands so soon as he had entered on the administration of colonial affairs and for the judicious measure of setting up the british flag in them we may observe that the health of her majesty's ministers proposed by mr hutt mp was received with loud and universal cheering and that mr labouchere's speech which was a very good one was well received upon the whole lord john's visit to the city on this occasion is calculated to gain the government favour among the commercial classes his lordship may well be proud that though new zealand was formally taken possession of in the name of the sovereign of this country many years ago it was reserved for him to make it a british colony monument to the late earl of durhum—the new zealand company have voted t towards the erection of the monument to the earl of durham—the noble earl having been the first governor of this important company there is something curious in the preference which the emigrants from england scotland and ireland display for different localities the proportions emigrating the countries below are as follows— emigrants english per cent scottish per cent irish per cent to united states — sydney — canada — portphilip as the table expressly bears to be a return of the persons who have emigrated we can scarcely suppose that it includes persons who went out to the countries mentioned on business without any intention of settling in the report for canada the number who went to the united states in is stated to be only or about two thirds of what stands in the above table it will be observed that not a single emigrant to india or ceylon appears in the table yet surely some persons go with the express view of remaining in these countries the number of person who were enabled to emigrate in by means of bounties payable in the colonies was for new south wales for van diemen's land it must be remembered that new south wales includes portphilip there are returns of land sold but not in a very perfect form in canada in the year and the lands sold were acres the average price was s to s d in lower and s to s in upper canada the lands granted without sale were acres exclusive of those for lower canada in in nova scotia new brunswick and cape breton about acres have been sold at prices varying from s d to s d the lands granted are inconsiderable at the cape acres have been sold in the three years at prices from s d to s d lands sold in new south wales acres average price sydney district— s d s d s d portphilip— s d s d six months— s d the sales were chiefly by auction in van diemen's land the sales in were about acres at s or s in western australia swan river in the sales were acres from s d to s in south australia acres at s the sales of land are no bad index of the progress of the colonies in capital and cultivation and according to this criterion it will be seen that those which were advancing most rapidly in the three years were sydney and portphilip the money received in payment of land in these two colonies in and amounted to t and if we understand the report correctly the whole of this sum is applicable to emigration that is to defraying the expense of carrying out emigrants the emigrants probably carried with them or expended on their passage twenty pounds each and thus the money which left the country must have amounted to upwards of two millions this gigantic emigration one of the things which convey an idea of the immense resources of britain the united kingdom contains only the ninth part of the population of europe and we believe it may be safely said that all the other eight parts do not send out half the number of emigrants annually which are

full operation to carry out in australia a principle which has been acted on with great success elsewhere namely that of taking up money in this country at a moderate rate of interest on the credit of a large invested capital and laying it out on undoubted freehold security at a higher rate the company is now prepared to grant transferable notes under the corporation seal to persons desirous of advancing money to the company on loan the notes will be for t each or any larger sum desired by the lender and will be made payable at any period which may be agreed upon not being shorter than two years the notes will bear interest at the rate of five per cent per annum payable halfyearly on the th january and th july on the production of the halfyearly vouchers which will be annexed to each note these vouchers or coupons will render it unnecessary for the holder of a note to present the note itself until the principal becomes due the form of note has been preferred to that of bond as admitting of transfer without expense or trouble whilst it affords equal security to the holder the colonial board has been established in sydney and the operation of the company are at present confined to new south wales security being the first object of the company all the arrangements have been framed with the view to attain that end the loans are made at a fixed interest of per cent although the current rate is much higher the land mortgaged exclusive of collateral security must not be of less value than double the amount of the loan the nonpayment of interest on the day it becomes due subjects the mortgager to per cent additional interest for the period in arrear and all parties in default for ten days are to be proceeded against the solicitor of the company without further instructions and without distinction or exception of any person whatever the colonial board only draws on the company as loans are agreed on their bills must be advertised for public competition and the purchasers pay the amount in exchange for the bill to the bank of australasia the capital of which is t to the credit of the company to be drawn out by checks of the colonial board in favour of the borrowers as the mortgages are completed the high character of the members of the colonial board affords the fullest assurance that these arrangements will be strictly adhered to in spirit as well as in form no difficulty has been experienced in investing the full monthly amount sanctioned by the instructions of the court of directors indeed the chairman of the colonial board states that he does not entertain the smallest doubt of a safe investment of all the funds which may be placed at the disposal of the colonial board the high rate of interest in australia has attracted much private capital from this country to be invested in mortgages these investments have been made through the agency of individuals or mercantile firms and therefore subject to contingencies from which the company is exempt to those who may desire to make such investments it must be obvois that the stock of the company presents a much superior security and the prospect of a greatly increased return inasmuch as the company derives a large profit by lending at per cent in australia the money borrowed here at half that rate it is equally clear that those who merely seek temporary employment for their money without becoming shareholders cannot have a better security than the promissory notes of the company for the due payment of which the whole capital of the company as well as the mortgages on which the money is laid out stand pledged every shareholder is required to execute in a deed of covenant by which he becomes bound to pay to the full amount of his shares and the charter supplies creditors with the utmost facility in enforcing demands against the company when it is considered that the funds of the company here are kept in government securities and no money lent in australia except on the best mortgages on land with collateral security in addition it may be fairly asserted that in many respects the promissory notes are entitled to a decided preference over mortgages in this country which generally bear one per cent less interest than that paid by the company the charter provides that the sums borrowed shall not exceed four times the amount of capital paid up that the whole capital of the company and all the mortgages on which their money is lent in australia shall constitute a security to the lenders of money to the company that the mortgages are to be on land with the power of taking collateral security on stock &c that every mortgage shall be registered—the register to contain such particulars as the governor of the colony may deem necessary that a copy of the register of the mortgages shall be kept at the office of the company in london for the information of the shareholders and lenders that an annual report be made

place beginning of april from pittsburgh and adreadful passage we had of it the waters of river ohio which had risen rapidly since march now poured down in a perfect torrent we were in as much danger of foundering at rapids as we would have been in the middlethe atlantic in a severe gale we were frequently too in the most imminent danger of our life from the limbs of trees hanging just above the and through which we were often hurried rate of seven miles an hour but the impetuo of the stream if any of the canoes had been tangled among these branches which in manyplaces hang very thick over the river they inevitably have been overturned and buried in the of the ohio fortunately accident happened to us our apprehensions of drowning were equalled by those of an attack from theindians who infest the river and who inhabit banks some time ago they killed a mr w browne and a mr allison who were returning to lexington from miami the barbarities they commit are wanton and inhuman to the l degree on the d ult they attacked a boat few miles from limestone and killed threesons two men and a woman a few days after this they killed two men on licking river and took a boy prisoner and on their return ated a boat below the scioto as it came to sh and killed four men and took one man and two women prisoners about three weeks ago theyed on a boat and a canoe above the scioto both sides of the river at the same time bywhich means they killed two men and in sho to such a degree have they carried these inh practices that it is dangerous to stir fromhome but in large parties and properly prepar to receive them yesterday forenoon arrived at spithead the lord dorcester merchantman edward howe master bound from halifax for london in this ship came six cherokee chiefs of the first rank one of them born in england as soon as their arrival was announced in form sir andrew douglas commander of the alcide of guns sent his barge to bring them ashore to portsmouth and upon landing they went to bradley's the crown inn the object of these chiefs coming to this country is to endeavour to form a connection with the english government in order to attempt the reduction of mexico near which place they have men in arms and can raise more in a short time the cherokees have menaced that country for these last three years and are favoured by great number of the inhabitants in the spanish settlements should they therefore procure respectable assistance from england the new world will be a certain conquest and open a source of trade and wealth to this nation that will more than compensate for the loss of america and the expence of attaining that grand object these indian chiefs are dressed in the habit of their country with their faces painted in an extraordinary manner they waited on colonel trigge of the th regiment of foot and some other officers of distinction one of them who was born in england named bowles speaks english indifferently well and is extremely communicative he went over to america with his parents who were in the army when a boy and by some means strayed to an indian camp where he was most hospitably received and afterwards raised to the highest honours of their nation the cherokee chiefs are expected in town this day to deliver their to mr secretary grenville monday j an by the fanny capt bryen arrived in twenty four days from new york we have american papers of which we give the following important intelligence— it is an undoubted truth strange as it may appear that the baron d'carondolet governor of louisiana and governor o'neal of pensacola have opened the shores of the king of spain in westflorida to the creeks and cherokees and delivered them arms and ammunition in abundance advising and stimulating them to go to war against the frontier inhabitants of the united states and that quickly that now or never was the time while the united states were engaged with the northern tribes on the th of september about midnight john buchanan's station four miles south of nashville at which sundry families had collected and fifteen gunmen was attacked by a part of creeks and lower cherokees supposed to consist of three of our hundred their approach was suspected by the running of cattle that had taken fright at them and upon examination they were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of the gate and from the place and distance they received the first fire from the man who discovered them john m'rocy they immediately returned the fire and continued a very heavy and constant firing upon the station blockhouses surrounded with a stockade for an hour and were repulsed with considerable loss without injuring man woman or child in the station during the whole time of the attack the indians were never more distant than ten yards from the block house and often in large numbers close round the lower walls attempting to put fire to it one ascended the roof with a torch where he was shot and falling to the ground renewed his attempts to fire the bottom logs and was killed the indians fired balls through a port hole of the overing which lodged in the roof in the circumference of the bat and those sticking in the walls on the outside are innumerable undoubted advices have been received that as early at the th of september as many as creeks passed the tennessee and the lower cherokee towns and below as on their way they decared to make war on cumberland—and that they were joined by about cherokees of those towns—this must have been the party that attacked buchanan's station dreadful havoc was expected but it is now hoped that the check they have received will induce them to return without making further attempts upon that settlement on the d instant black's block house on the head of crooked creek a branch of little river at which there was a serjeant's command of cape crawford's company was attacked by surprise about an hour and a half in the night by a party of indians commanded by a cherokee of will's town called the tail a brother of the bench and talohteske consisting of other cherokees and creeks james paul was killed in the knife and george morse and robert sharp at a fire on the outside and john shankland wounded horses were killed and taken off these are the fruits of the advise of the baron d'carrondolet and governor o'neal and it is due to mr paton their chief instrument to add he has well acted his part we hear from fayetteville north carolina that on tuesday the d of october last a fire broke out in that town owing to the negligence of a small negro girl which consumed about dwelling houses and stores and buildings of other descriptions richmond january extract of a letter from a gentleman now residing at quebec to his correspondent in this city dated jan our humanity was deeply affected by the dreadful carnage made by the indians you may be assured that the number of indians did not exceed and that nothing saved general st clair and the remainder of his army but the great quantity of plunder he left to the indians they were composed of various tribes and threefourths of of them remained in the camp to plunder it and to take scalps the trophies of their victory and he that got most when he returned to his nation acquired the greatest share of glory hence only about pursued the loss of the indians is under killed and wounded the victory they have obtained at so easy a purchase and the riches they obtained by the plunder and the provisions they found will make them a more terrible foe than ever they have been they boast of taking an amazing quantity of powder and arms which they wanted many of them were only armed with spears and hatchets and i have no doubt but if another expedition should be set on foot that they will be met by three times the number of indians the indian tribes of nations who live many hundred miles back have all entered into an association and made the present war a common concern they to oppose what they call the common enemy the warriors of the different tribes so united are not less than or numbers of the chiefs of ten or twelve numerous nations were here last summer lord dorchester advised them to make peace and offered his mediations he told them he was at peace with the united states and could give them no assistance their answer was that the enemy was in their country and would not make peace with them but on term dishonourable and at the expense of their country and that they had determined to die before they would accept of such terms they felt much dissatisfied with the answer they received and departed with a full determination to defend their country with the last of their blood you may depend on it that many years will elapse and many thousand men be expended before the united states will by the present measures be able to possess the country in contest and i may also add that i have great apprehensions that desolation and destruction will be the consequence on the frontiers of the ohio this winter and next spring i would to god some steps might be taken to prevent them i have no doubt the country might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the expence already incurred by the different expeditions the attempt to take the country from them by force is founded in unrighteousness and ought to be abandoned besides if the american mean to have anytrade with them they are taking steps that will prevent it for many years to come the indians do not easily forget or forgive injuries carlisle jan by the pittsburgh post which arrived yesterday we are informed that previous to his leaving pittsburgh an express had arrived there with the melancholy news that forts jefferson and franklin were taken by indians and that two large bodies of them were moving to the allighany extract of a letter from patowmack north amerca feb last sunday evening came to this town a young man from catfish which he left about two weeks ago and who gave us the following pleasing interesting and important intelligence viz that two days before he left catfish two men arrived there from licking who informed that they had been out with a body of volunteers on horseback from kentucky under general scott that they left licking on the expedition a few days before christmas that general scott dispatched three spies in advance who when they arrived about miles beyond the spot where general st clair was defeated they discovered a large body of indians diverting and enjoying themselves with the plunder they had taken riding the bullocks dancing &c and appeared to be mostly drunk that on the information being given to general scott who with the main body were a few miles in the rear he divided them into three divisions advanced and fell on the enemy by surprise that the contest was short but victorious on the side of the volunteers of the enemy being killed on the spot all the cannon and stores in their possession retaken and the remainder of that savage body put to flight that general scott having lost but six men returned to licking in triumph with most of the cattle stores &c leaving the cannon at fort jefferson that general scott had previously gone out with men but finding his number was insufficient was returning but met a body of volunteers when upon joining him he immediately proceeded in prosecution of his original design which fortunately proved successful our informant further adds that he saw a kentucky newspaper of the th of january at morgan town brought by major scott's expedition which corresponded with that given by the two men at cat fish and that gen scott brought in near scalps the unsettled state of a great part of the westtern frontiers of america if we can suppose that there are any determined frontiers when the settlers are making large and continual encroachments must very much depreciate the sale of lands in those parts notwithstanding the very small rates of purchase demanded for vast extents of ground and the soil being remarkable fertile and productive the ineffectual attempts of last summer to prevent the future depredations of the miamis and some other tribes of indians and the barbarities before and since committed on the setlers must occasion other people to be very cautious of removing to places where they would hold their lives and property on a very precarious teure unless the arms of the state prove remarkably successful in their future attacks nassau new england march the red bugs which did so much injury to the cotton last year have again made their appearance but not in such numbers as was first expected the hops in many states of america have been particularly productive a letter from greatogreechee in georgia dated december th says since the completion of the treaty with the creeks all has been very quiet unless we except some illnatured state bickerings and heartburning amongst ourselves chiefly occasioned by a few influential men who find themselves great losers by a general act of common justice towards the indians these however we expect will subside by degrees notwithstanding the formidable combination in a certain part of the state as to the creeks siminoles and other nations adjoining our western frontier nothing is clearer than that so far from being injurious to us they may henceforward be made useful to the real interests of this state provided the faith of treaties be observed they now show every disposition to copy our manners arts agriculture and mode of living mr bowles the cherokee chief proposes to introduce the art of printing amongst the indians with whom he resides and for this purpose has engaged two persons to accompany him on his return and has provided himself with all the implements of the art the day fixed for their departure is the th of march the indian companions of mr bowles are two creeks and two cherokees these nations though contiguous to each other and in strict union differ as essentially as possible in language and manners both however entertain the most implacable animosity against the spaniards whose authority and dominions in south america they make no scruple of avowing they mean to try to diminish the indian chiefs lately arrived in town are six in number they have been indiscriminately styled cherokees but three of them only are of that nation and three are creek indians—they are all handsome men not exceeding in age twenty five or twentysix these six chiefs have warriors ready to take the field and have the strongest wish to act in conjunction with the english they travelled miles before the reached halifax and were near months in performing the journey from halifax they went in an english frigate to quebec to lord dorchester by whom they were sent over to england to concert their plans in person with the ministry the object of their coming to this country may be easily guessed at they long to make an attack upon the spanish settlements one of them was heard last night in the playhouse to say he hoped in six months from this time to be in the heart of mexico when hostilities are once commenced a forfidable armament will unquestionable be sent against the spanish south american colonies of its success there cannot be a doubt when we shall be aided by an army of indian warriors beside the active support of those mexicans now under the tyranous yoke of spain so determined are the cherokees the creeks and other nations of indians in the southern parts of america to strip the spaniards of their possessions on that continent that they will unquestionably attempt the glorious achievement even though the policy of this country should prevent us from lending them effectual assistance the rich silver mines at potosi in peru were accidentally discovered in by an indian as he was clambering up the mountain in pursuit of a lama which had strayed from his flock soon after the mines of sacotecas in new spain little inferior to the other in value were opened from that time successive discoveries have been made in both colonies and silver mines are now so numerous that the working of them and of some few mines of gold in the provinces of terra firm and the new kingdom of grenada has become the capital occupation of the spaniards and is reduced into the system no less complicated than interesting extract of a letter from a gentleman in muskingum to his friend in the city of norwich connecticut dated nov the prospect of peace from our frontiers seems to me to be vanished for the present the troops from this garrison have this morning returned and the best account i can collect of the expedition is as follows viz the troops amounting to about militia and about regulars after seventeen days march from miami reached the great miami village about miles without any molestation except having a number of their packhorse stole—on their arrival they found the village deserted and all the valuable builder a short tarry they proceeded to neighings set on flames by the indians afbouring villages without molestation and deftroyed five of them and a quantity of corn computed at fifteen thousand bushels which they found buried in different places and very large quantities of vegetables of every kind the firstopposition that was met with a party of about kentucky militia and thirty regular troops all under the command of col hardin of kentucky were detached from the main body lying in the great miami village to pursue the track of a party of indians which had the day before been discovered after a pursuit of about six miles they came up with and were attacked by surprise by a body of indians who were concealed in the thickets on every side of a large plain and on the first onset the militia without exchanging a single fire made a most precipitate retreat and left the regular troops to stand the whole charge of the indians the conflict was short and bloody the troops were soon overpowered by numbers and all fell except the two offiers and two or three privates after defending themselves at their bayonet points with the greatest possible obstinacy ensign hartshorn of franklin was one of the four that escaped and his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat and by that means screening himself from the eye of his pursuers that from any other circumstance captain armstrong who commanded the party likewise made his escape by plunging himself into a pond or swamp up to his neck within two hundred yards of the field of action where he remained the whole night as a spectator of the horrid scene of the war dance performed over the dead and wounded bodies of the poor soldiers that had fallen the preceding day where their shrieks mixed with the horrid yells of the savages rendered his situation shocking after this some few skirmishes succeeded but nothing material until the second capital action which happened two days after the army left the miami village at ten miles distance from the town the general ordered a halt and detached from four to five hundred militia and about sixty regular soldiers commanded by major wylls all under the command of col harden with orders to march back to the town on their first entrance into the town there appeared a small body of indians who immediately fled at the first onset and by that means decoyed the whole body of militia by making their flight into different directions and encouraging the militia to pursue by this means the regular troops were left alone and the indians had effected their design for the moment they found the small handful of regular troops detached from the main body of militia they commenced the attack with their whole force excepting the flying parties that had diverted the militia and although they soon found some part of the militia returning on their back pursued their object of routing and destroying the troops as the only sure plan of success which after the bloody conflict on each side they effect the regular troops all to nine including two commissioned officers were killed and disabled and a total defeat ensued among the slain were major wylls of hartford and lieut frothingham of middletown of the militia it is said about an hundred were killed among whom were a number of brave and valuable characters the indians it appears from some cause did not think it prudent to pursue their successes from the field of action for most of the troops that were not killed or sorely wounded made their escape which they never could have done had the indians pursued with their usual fury nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the indians on this occasion the militia they appeared to despise and with all the undautedness conceivable threw down their guns and rushed upon the bayonets of the regular soldiers a great number of them fell but being so far superior in numbers soon overpowered them for while the poor soldier had his bayonet in one indiaman two more would sink their tomahawks in his head the defeat of our troops was complete the dead and wounded were left on the field in possession of the savages no damage of any consequence has been sustained in this part of the country from the indians but what effect the expedition may have on us as relates to our frontier it uncertain—if the western indians have any idea of treating for peace we shall be safe if not we are much exposed extract of a letter from norfolk virginia oct we learn from the west country that the kentucky

congress wednesday dec the speech of george washington esqpresident of the congress on the fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives i n meeting you again i feel much satisfaction on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs the abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of flourishing commerce the progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of american stock abroad as well as at home and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated this latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit and let me add as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens the punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary in conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of of florins towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in holland—as well theexchange with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of europe give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success the secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information since your last sessions i have received communication by which it appears that the district of kentucke at present a part of virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the union in case the requisite sanction of congress be added for this sanction application is now made i shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you the liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honour to both the parties and the sentiments of warm attachment of the union and its present government expressed by our fellowcitizens of kentucke cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you it has been heretofore known to congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of indians from the north west side of the ohio these with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the united states renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect—the lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity these aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments as this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the president to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers and i have accordingly authorised an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient the event of the measure is yet unknown to me the secretary at war is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended the disturbed situation of europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the united states reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings it requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge in means and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets i recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the mediterranean so many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection the laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons you will consider in your wisdom whether improvement of a judicatory system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person yu will consider in your wisdom whether im provements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether process of execution on sentences issuing from the federal courts be not desirable through all the states the patronage of our commerce of our merchants and seamen has called for the appointment of consuls in foreign countries it seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence the consular convention too with his most christian majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the national authority to his consuls established here some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect the establishment of the militia of a mint of standards of weights and measures of the post office and post roads are subjects which i presume you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance gentlemen of the house of representatives the sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favourite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself the appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject and i am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents gentlemen of the senate and house of representatives in perusing the various and weighty business of the present session i indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country in whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the cooperation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire it will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence signed george washington united states dec the following it is said are

them to distress the americans and prove at least a hindrance to their growing prosperitythe free navigation of the mississippi has been denied themand the spaniards now in possession of the floridas have been continually quarrelling with them about their boundaries it may therefore be considered as almost certain that the american states will take an active part against spain this will be a great acquisition to britain in every point of view for though american cannot furnish money she can furnish men and provisions and afree intercourse with her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the

a well known fact that they are regularly supplied with cloathing arms and ammunition from the royal magazines at st augustine and pensacola and therefore in all probability the sword not the olive

is received from st mark's in hispaniola that on the st of this month a number of free people of colour to the amount of and upwards having possessed themselves of several field pieces formed a camp in that districh and exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarming a deputation of five gentlemen being sent from the assembly to demand the reason of so extraordinary a proceeding the insurgents demanded that a remonstrance which they then delivered to the deputies should be presented imimmediately to the general and that an answer thereto should be given without delay the paper being conveyed as they desired proved to be a sensible and well written detail of the various claims the free people of colour had on what they termed the justice of the whites with whom they demanded an equal participation of all rights and immunities whatsoever—the privilege of representation and of qualifying for all the learned professions—and concluding with the avowal of a determination to proceed to extremities should their demands be treat with neglect on the perusal of this paper it was judged adviseable to assemble a body of the militia who headed by the general immediately went against the camp on their arrival the insurgents fired and fled to the mountains three or four of the whites were killed and one of the ringleaders was taken and instantly beheaded a proclamation was then issued offering a reward of half joes for the head of any principal offender and in the course of a few days not less than twenty seven were brought in on sunday the th instant a very great majority of those who had formed the camp finding all their attempts completely frustrated came in and took the oath of allegiance to the nation one or two of the principals for whom high rewards are offered are not yet taken from port maria we have received the disagreeable account of the loss of the ship lion capt smith belonging to liverpool a violent breeze on the th instant drove her from her anchors and she now lies stranded on the beach nootka sound the circumstances of thetrade and situation of this part of north america being a matter of such general conversation and great public moment we are particularly happy in being enabled to give some further account of the transactions that have happened at nootka sounds as well as to point out the advantages that were likely to be extended to other places by the means of this trade it is necessary to remark that the skin of the sea otter is worn only in the northern regions of china its fur though beautiful and magnificent is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the southern provinces pekin is therefore the proper mart for this valuable commodity and in this immense city the consumption is so great that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale the mandarins of the court and even the emperor himself are fond of wearing this costly fur to a citizen of common rank a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury the natives of the north west coast of ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds that all the blankets cloths hats and stockings that could be procured in china if english manufacture were sold to the indians with whose chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed an act of cruelty committed by an officer of the spanish admiral martiney's ship deserves to be recorded the spaniards discovering that callicum a chief second in authority at nootka sound was in alliance with the english he was shot through the heart in the month of june the wife of callicum with an infant child escaped but not till wounded macquilla the chief first in command retired at the head of the allies of england from nootka sound and to avoid the cruelty of the spaniards they fled to distant parts such of the natives as they could seize the spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications at this period it was in the contemplation of the spaniards to seize the sandwich islands with a view to deprive british ships of refreshments and we further add on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration that on the very lands purchased from the nootka chief by captain mears the spaniards have already opened valuable mines another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of kamschatka and other ports belonging to the russians with the teas and other produce of china this promised to be an invaluable channel of commerce as the chinese have shut their ports against the russians who on this voyage of discovery and experiment one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo but was unfortunately lost on her return to china to these curious particulars we add with a patriot joy that the consumption of the glorious staple of england her broad cloths is astonishingly great in japan and china british hardware &c is also in great request from the friendship of tiara to captain mears ships which touch at the sandwich islands may depend on the

that five spaniards should be instantly delivered up as an attonement this was peremptorily refused as being more than commensurate to the offence but the murderer was offered as a satisfaction the indians would not accept him singly and departed vowing the severest revenge a few days afterwards intelligence was received that they had surprised and massacred sixteen men who had been at work in

danger—at that place we were informed of several disasters which had befallen boats going down the river and one to a boat going up to a french station loaded with bacon butter &c the particulars relative to the latter are as follow—the boat was attacked by about or indians and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them —immediately after firing they gave the indian whoop and rushing on the flankets scalped them every one about — they then fired at the boat but did no damage as it required some time to make their way into the river after the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity they continued on the river watching for other boats in the course of about six days five or six boats happened to come down the river—the savages attacked the foremost of them in which were two young ladies of the name macdonald a young gentleman and some others passengers and took it elevated with this easy capture they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with—in a little time a second boat hove in fight which they attacked with great fury—they were in three canoes each canoe containing about twenty—they moved towards the boat as it came down and commenced firing after discharging their guns they retreated loading and came on a second time fired and repeated nine different times as often as they come on there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat which contained nine fighting men—during the conflict two were killed and five wounded two only remained to protect the boat and prevent the indians from boarding it which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated—these two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner—on a near approach of the they threw billets of wood at them and one of them took up an ax as a weapon of defence should they persist in boarding which the indians perceiving and as is supposed their ammunition being expended they retreated without accomplishing their object these inhuman monsters previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes in which situation they were both killed a few days after this transaction they fired at another boat and killed one young man in short every boat tat has gone down the river lately has been fired at except our's we saw no indians the places where the above depredation happened we

strength to the report of a rupture with america the representations which have been very forcibly urged by the american minister mr pinckney include various topics of complaint amongst these are the withholding of the poste of niagara detroit &c in violation of the treaty of the exciting of the creek and other indians to make war upon the american frontier the refusal to make compensation for the property seized by the armies under lord cornwallis &c in the southern states according to stipulation the seizure of american ships bound to france the impressing of american citizens to man our fleets and finally the sullen silence which the british minister is alledged to have uniformly maintained on the subject of the claims made by the republic the american minister has however so little hope of efficacy from these representations that he has ordered in his tradesman's bills and made every other preparation for an abrupt departure notwithstanding this aminy aspect of affairs we still must hope that no consequences subversive of the pacific system at present subsisting between america and great britain will ensue for illjudged and ignorant indeed of the true interests of his

the impressing of american citizens to man our fleets and finally the sullen silence which the british minister is alledged to have uniformly maintained on the subject of the claims made by the republic the american minister has however so little hope of efficacy from these representations that he has ordered in his tradesmen's bills and made every other preparation for an abrupt departure not withstanding this alarming aspect of affairs we still must hope that no consequences subversive of the pacific system at present subsisting between american and great britain will ensue for illjudged and ignorant indeed of the true interests of his country must that briton be whatever his rank who would advise another american war —a war which reasoning of the future by the sorrowful experience of the past can only serve to increase the sum and to swell the catalogue of human woes letters from quebec dated nov say that every thing was quiet in that province some letters from quebec were on saturday received at the general post office which state that the american army under the command of general wayne had been routed by the otoway indians an advanced party of men had been entirely cut off his army consisted of regulars and volunteers extract of a letter from an englishman dated lima septemper lima is what an englishman would call a dirty colonial town inhabitants is the outside of its population the whites are about europeans and not as many born in the country the rest are blacks and mulattoes of the mulattoes there are eight various shades i never saw such a wretched herd as lima incloses more poverty and misery than in any town of the size in the world—there are some few splendid houses but the rest so disgustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin the streets as in all american towns run at right angles a powerful stream of water in each the town is capable of great improvement the climate must be bad for the whole population look as if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air a halfborn race—melancholy in their faces on the whole coast of peru we made the same observation the ague very general with fever—their habits and manner of living increase the evil thin clothing and vegetable diet—nights very cold —i sleep under a heavy blanket and could bear another a thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter the heat however is not excessive during summer on the whole not an oppressive climate if the people had any idea of living in a rational way very few families cook at home—they buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets in pulperias and in the squares not six families in lima that have wine on their tables they drink brandy at all hours and excuse themselves for not having any thing that is expensive by saying it gives the ague the same person who denies himself a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in the evening their money goes in gambling debauchery and dress every woman high and low has her price a lady takes no offence at her frailty being exposed she tells you she is quite at good as her neighbours and needs be no better the spanish nation and government are the cause of all the degradation of south america every viceroy from pizarro to pezuela was a plunderer a teacher of immorality in words and deeds the miserable state of this people seems incredible—one must see to believe it scarcely a young lady can read or write or use a needle few houses that the devil has not appeared in and a devout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the virgin mary thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves as to priestcraft it reigns here in all its glory a third part of lima is covered with churches some of them very splendid the whole trade of this part of peru depends on the single mine of the mountain of pasco for returns if this is worked to advantage it will produce six millions of dollars but if the country is disturbed by war not a dollar will they have the exports of peru in ordinary times were five millions of dollars in pecie and one million in produce mininng may be carried to any extent it is true but this requires tranquillity and good government people in europe have the most erroneous ideas or peru every traveller and historian who has written or talked about it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar arica the second port of peru and the great outlet to upper peru is a wretched village of hovels covered with mud—about mulattoes and indians—placed on a sand bank—the people all in the ague—not a boat or ship of any sort the harbourmaster came off on bulsa two bladders lashed together paddled by an indian we could not get a basket of fruit or vegetablse for money their cultuvation was three leagues off but they were too lazy to fetch any thing though a seventyfour and a frigate layto twnety hours offering them any price for their tropical fruits i hire a small room for dollars a month and sleep on the ground borrowed a chair and bought some crockery no such thing as a tavern never was letters of no use no one asks me to his house i go to bed at eight o'clock to kill time a play twice a week the most fashionable ladies stand up in the front boxes and light a segar by the chandelier the house filled with smoke there are titled families mostly idiots—all reduced to poverty by the emancipation of their slaves if the war be continued a year peru will be the most wretched country on the globe indeed the indians will regain their empire and exterminate all other colours the number of blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy thousand— in lima and adjacent village the total population of peru about three millions—threefourths indians about the town there are many fine gardens with pretty country houses provisions of all sorts excellent and in the greatest variety fruits of all climates in the marketplace the produce of the seashore and the cordillera—beef and mutton excellent—the chief supplies come from janja and other vallies in the cordillera the seashore produce is continued to little vallies badly cultivated those about the town would disgrace the free negroes of carolina most valuable land a league from the town half cultivated and half abandoned every thing left to starved slaves such famished objects i never beheld no other hands to cultivate when emancipation becomes general they will not work and famine must ensue lands in america for sale these two adjoining tracks of land in the county of fayette and state of

other track counsists of acres and is to be sold in one lot at s d per acre there is a fine stream of water running through these two tracks of land which communicates with the great river ohio so

repidly settled the returns made to congress upon st may state them at in march there were upwards of and from their astonishing increase since they may be estimated at eleven years ago kentucky lay in a forest but now she exhibits an extensive settlement divided into seven populous counties in which are a great number of flourishing towns and contains more inhabitants than are in georgia delaware and rhode island states there are about churches in kentucky and mostly presbyterians there is a college and schools are established in every town there is a printingoffice a weekly gazette

elected to any office in the commonwealth for farther particulars apply to mr john granger writer to the signet david niven writer glasgow or to mr john finlayson writer cupar fife as the following speech of gen washington at the opening of the congress of the united states at new york nov gives an impartial account of the situation of that counttry we are persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives it is some abaof the satisfaction with which i meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally i am not able to add to it information that indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our western frontier have terminated you will i am persuaded learn with no less concern than i communicate it that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of preserving hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest an earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier—to stop the further effusion of blood—to arrest the progress of expense—to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable puposes—in making which efforts i consulted less my own anticipations of the events or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable to ascertain unequivocally the such is the case a detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thu s far will i trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed the issue of some of them indeed is still depending but a favourable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by any thing that has yet happened in the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service a sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace it will i presume be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased it must add to your concern to be informed what besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it a part of the cherokees known by the name of chickamagas inhabiting five villages on the river have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements it was hoped that the treat of holston made with the cherokee nation in july would have prevented a repetition of such depredations but the event has not answered this hope the chickamagas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unproved hostilities upon the citizens of the united states in that quarter i have reason to believe that every predictable exertion has been made pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures a large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete and pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed a delay of operations besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termintion of the war has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts a statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable in looking forward to the future expence of the operations which may be found inevitable i derive consolation from the information i receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year this however will be better ascertained in the course of the session and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds from the supposition of no material extention of the spirit of hostilities i cannot dismiss the subject of indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the indians without which all plans must prove nugatory to enable by ent rewards the employment of qualified persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood if in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoing civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulation calction its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable the prosperous state of our revenue had been intimated—this would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in someplaces continue to embarrass the collection ofduties on spirits distilled within the united states these impediments have lessened and areessdin local extent and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the lawapp to be progressive but symptoms of increased opposition have lately manifested themselves in certain quarters i judged special interposition on my part proper and adviseable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for this object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in excution for bring to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders and congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend on me shall be wantingsert and maintain the just authority of the law in fulfilling this trust i shall count entirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of the government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens i cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system a representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are being experienced in the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the structure of that system which some casesto relax their efficacy as connected with the subject provisions to facilitate the raking ofupon processes out of the courts of the united states and supplementary definition of offence against the constitution and laws of the unionof the punishment for such offences will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary i would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a conditiongive that satisfaction to foreign nations whichmay sometimes have occasion to require from them i particularly recommend to your considerations the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations as other infractions of the law of nations which furnishes just subject of complaint might endanger our own peace with them and in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attentionexpiration of the law for that purpose which taken place if not re at the close of the present session in execution of the authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engagement of our mint—others have been employed at at home provision has been made of the requisite buildings and therefore now putting into proper condition for the purpose of the establishment there has also been a small beginning in the coinage of halfdollars the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them the regulation of some provision in the law which establishes the post office open to in experiment against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country—should that upon the enquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and infor mation will i doubt not lead to the application of a remedy the adoption of a constitution for the state of kentucky has been notified to me the legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order it is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for three millions of florins—one at antwerp at the annual interest of four and onehalf per cent with an allowance of four per cent in lieu of all charages—the rates of these loans and the circumstance under which they have been made ar confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced gentlemen of the house of representatives i entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effecttual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the government —no measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made for the bank of the united states pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated in fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and i doubt not engage your early attention gentlemen of the senate and of the house of representatives i content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you various temporary laws will expire during the present sesssion among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the indian tribes will merit your particular notice the results of your common deliberations hitherto will i trust be productive of solide and durable advantages to our constituentes such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strength and confirm their attachment upon which under divine providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivatino of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils g washington extracts from late newspapers new york july this city and its vicinity were exceedingly alarmed last sabbath about

settled on them but that the united states would be willing to give more goods than they had given at any other time the indians replied that if the congress would give one half these goods to the people that had settled the would leave the land and remove the difficulty our commissioners replied that the land they must have and would not give it up the indians said it was well and there need no more be said however desired them to remain if they thought proper until they returned to the council and laid this before them on the th of august two indians came and informed that the final

which came to a wharf betwen arch and racestreet beause the infection broke out ina house connected with that vessel and it was afterwards traced to that vessel the disorder overtook several families thereabouts but most people apprehended it to be the general fallfever which acted severly on those who had the influenza—to that there was no material danger apprehended until the death of peter ashton in vinestreet who after a short illness died about one month past after which the disorder was clearly discovered to be the putrid or yellow fever and each person became after of his neighbours insomuch that if any became sick they were avoided and many fled from the sick leaving them in adestitute situation perhaps shut up in a house and the neighbours alarmed merchants and housekeepers moved into the country and fear was stamped on every countenance—infirmness possessed the hearts of the people—little business was done except packing up—engaging waggons to move goods into the country and searching for shelter for their families many families set off without having a particular place to go to thus the country became alarmed individuals died in the country—but i cannot learn

moved by the distresses of the helpless took possession of bushhill mansion it being empty and erected a hospital employed some physicians and nurses sent out some accomadations and provided for interring the dead the overseers became inadequate to the business by reason fo fear few in number and the funds exhausted added to this the extravagant wages of the nurses two and three dollars per day most of the magistrates fled the house of employment and hospital shut their doors against all indigent and indisposed persons thus were the people who had been private patientes on the poor list abandoned and had no sheltering place and those who were slightly indisposed were sent to bushhill and became victims with many others the inhabitants were requested to meet by public advertisement

legislature house of representatives dec the secretary of the senate announced that the members of the senate were ready to admit the members of the house of representatives in the senate chamber in order to receive the president's communication fellowcitizens of the senate and of the house of representatives since the commencement of the term for which i have been again called into office no fit occasion has arisen for expressing to me fellow citizens at large the deep and respectful sense which i feel of the renewed testimony of public approbation while on the one hand it awakened my gratitude for all those instances of affectionate partiality with which i have been honoured by my country on the other it could not prevent an earnest wish for that retirement from which no private consideration should ever have torn me but influenced by the belief that my conduct would be estimated according to its real motives and that the people and the authorities derived from them would support exertions having nothing personal for their object i have obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the executive power and i humbly implore that being on whose will the fate of nations depends to crown with success our mutual endeavors for the general happiness as soon as the war in europe had embraced those powers with whom the united states have the most extensive relations there was reason to apprehend that our intercourse with them might be interrupted and our disposition for peace drawn into question by the suspicions too often entertained by belligerent nations it seemed therefore to be my duty to admonish our citizens of the consequences of a contraband trade and of hostile acts to any of the parties and to obtain by a declaration of the existing legal state of things an easier admission of our right to the immunities belonging to our situation under these impressions the proclamation which will be laid before you was issued in this posture of affairs both new and delicate i resolved to adopt general rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the privileges of the united states these were reduced into a system which will be communicated to you although i have not thought myself at liberty to forbid the sale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of commerce with france to be brought into our ports i have not refused to cause them to be restored when they were taken within the protection of our territory or by vessels commissioned or equipped in a warlike form within the limits of the united states it rests with the wisdom of congress to correct improve or enforce this plan of procedure and it will probably be found expedient to extend the legal code and the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states to many cases which though dependent on principles already recognized demand some further provisions where individuals shall within the united states array themselves in hostility against any of the powers at war or enter upon military expeditions or enterprizes within the jurisdiction of the united states or where the penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been indistinctly marked or are inadequate those offenses cannot receive too early and close an attention and require prompt and decisive remedies whatsoever those remedies may be they will be well administered by the judiciary who possess a longestablished course of investigation effectual process and officers in the habit of executing it in like manner as several of the courts have doubted under particular circumstances their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peace and even of a citizen of the united states although seized under a false colour of being hostile property and have denied their power to liberate certain captures within the protection of our territory it would seem proper to regulate their jurisdiction in these points but if the executive is to be the resort in either of the two last mentioned cases it is hoped that he will be authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courts when for his own information he shall request it i can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of our duties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the necessity of placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense and of exacting from them the fulfillment of their duties toward us the united states ought not to indulge a persuasion that contrary to the order of human events they will for ever keep at a distance those painful appeals to arms with which the history of every other nation abounds there is a rank due to the united states among nations which will be withheld if not absolutely lost by the reputation of weakness if we desire to avoid insult we must be able to repel it if we desire to secure peace one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity it must be known that we are at all times ready for war the documents which will be presented to you will shew the amount and kinds of arms and military stores now in our magazines and arsenals and yet an addition even to these supplies cannot with prudence be neglected as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuring a warlike apparatus in the moment of public danger nor can such arrangements with such objects be exposed to the censure or jealousy of the warmest friends of republican government they are incapable of abuse in the hands of the militia who ought to possess a pride in being the depository of the force of the republic and may be trained to a degree of energy equal to every military exigency of the united states but it is an enquiry which cannot be too solemnly pursued whether the act more effectually to provide for the national defense by establishing an uniform militia throughout the united states has organized them so as to produce their full effect whether your own experience in the several states has not detected some imperfections in the scheme and whether a material feature in an improvement of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity for the study of those branches of the military art which can scarcely ever be attained by practice alone the connection of the united states with europe has become extremely interesting the occurrences which relate to it and have passed under the knowledge of the executive will be exhibited to congress in a subsequent communication when we contemplate the war on our frontiers it may be truly affirmed that every reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissension with the indians north of the ohio the instructions given to the commissioners evince a moderation and equity proceeding from a sincere love of peace and a liberality having no restriction but the essential interests and dignity of the united states the attempt however of an amicable negotiation having been frustrated the troops have marched to act offensively although the proposed treaty did not arrest the progress of military preparation it is doubtful how far the advance of the season before good faith justified active movements may retard them during the remainder of the year from the papers and intelligence which relate to this important subject you will determine whether the deficiency in the number of troops granted by law shall be compensated by succors of militia or additional encouragements shall be proposed to recruits an anxiety has been also demonstrated by the executive for peace with the creeks and the cherokees the former have been relieved with corn and with clothing and offensive measures against them prohibited during the recess of congress to satisfy the complaints of the latter prosecutions have been instituted for the violences committed upon them but the papers which will be delivered to you disclose the critical footing on which we stand in regard to both those tribes and it is with congress to pronounce what shall be done after they shall have provided for the present emergency it will merit their most serious labours to render tranquillity with the savages permanent by creating ties of interest next to a rigorous execution of justice on the violators of peace the establishment of commerce with the indian nations in behalf of the united states is most likely to conciliate their attachment but it ought to be conducted without fraud without extortion with constant and plentiful supplies with a ready market for the commodities of the indians and a stated price for what they give in payment and receive in exchange individuals will not pursue such a traffic unless they be allured by the hope of profit but it will be enough for the united states to be reimbursed only should this recommendation accord with the opinion of congress they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by any means yet in the hands of the executive gentlemen of the house of representatives the commissioners charged with the settlement of the accounts between the united and individual states concluded their important function within the limited time by law and the balances struck in their report which will be laid before congress have been placed on the books of the treasury on the st day of june last an installment of on million of florins became payable on the loans of the united states in holland this was adjusted by a prolongation of the period of reimbursement in nature of a new loan at an interest of five per cent for the term of ten years and the expenses of this operation were a commission of three per cent the first installment of the loan of two millions of dollars from the bank of the united states has been paid as was directed by law for the second it is necessary that provision be made no pecuniary consideration is more urgent than the redemption and discharge of the public debt on none can delay be more injurious or an economy of time more valuable the productiveness of the public revenues hitherto has continued to equal the anticipations which were formed of it but it is not expected to prove commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested some auxiliary provisions will therefore it is presumed be requisite and it is hoped that these may be made consistently with a due regard to the convenience of ourcitizens who can not but be sensible of the true wisdom of encountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviate a future accumulation of burdens but here i can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the transportation of public prints there is no resource so firm for the government of the united states as the affections of the people guided by an enlightened policy and to this primary good nothing can conduce more than a faithful representation of public proceedings diffused without restraint throughout the united states an estimate of the appropriations necessary for the current service of the ensuing year and a statement of a purchase of arms and military stores made during the recess will be presented to congress gentlemen of the senate and of the house of representatives the several subjects to which i have now referred open a wide range to your deliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of our common country permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude of your task—without an unprejudiced coolness the welfare of the government may be hazarded without harmony as far as consists with freedom of sentiment its dignity may be lost—but as the legislative proceedings of the united states will never i trust be reproached for the want of temper or of candour so shall not the public happiness languish from the want of my strenuous and warmest cooperation george washington philadelphia dec the president having withdrawn the members of the house of representatives returned to their chamber where the president's address was read and referred to a committee to report the draft of an answer a committee was then appointed to report the unfinished business of the last house—adjourned thursday dec the journal of the commissioners for treating with the indians was read it is minute and lengthy the definitive answer of the indians contains their reasons for rejecting the proposals of the commissioners drawn up in a masterly manner it bears all the appearance of european logic faintly clad in an indian dress all the documents relative to this business were referred to a committee of the whole on the state of the union a message was received from the president communication sundry papers relative to our european relations and also the result of the proceedings of the commissioners appointed to settle the accounts of the united states with the individual states the first set of papers is introduced by a message of which the following is a copy united states dec gentlemen of the senate and of the house of representatives as the present situations of the several nations of europe and especially of those with whom the united states have important relations cannot but render the state of things between them and us matter of interest ing enquiry to the legislature and may indeed give rise to deliberations to which they alone are competent i have thought it my duty to communicate them certain correspondencies which have taken place the representatives and executive bodies of france have manifested generally a friendly attachment to this country have given advantages to our commerce and navigation and have made overtures for placing these advantages on permanent ground a decree however of the national assembly subjecting vessels laden with provisions to be carried into their ports and making enemy goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend contrary to our treaty though revoked at one time as to the united states has been since extended to their vessels also as has been recently stated to us representations on this subject will be immediately given in charge to our minister there and the result shall be communicated to the legislature it is with extreme concern i have to inform you that the proceedings of the person whom they have unfortunately appointed their minister plenipotentiary here have breathed nothing of the friendly spirit of that nation which sent him their tendency on the contrary has been to involve us in a war abroad and discord and anarchy at home so far as his acts or those of his agents have threatened our immediate commitment in the war or flagrant insult to the authority of the laws their effect has been counteracted by the ordinary cognizance of the laws and by an exertions of the powers confided to me where their danger was not imminent they have been born with from sentiments of regard to his nation from a sense of their friendship towards us from a conviction that they would not suffer us to remain long exposed to the action of a person who has so little respectedour mu tual dispositions and i will add from a reliance on the firmness of my fellow citizens in their principles of peace and order in the mean time i have respected and pursued the stipulations of our treaties according to what i judge the true sense and have withheld no act of friendship which their affairs have called for from us and which justice to others let us free to perform i have gone further—rather than employ force for the restitution of certain vessels which i deemed the united states bound to restore i thought it more advisable to satisfy the parties by avowing it to be my opinion that if restitution were not made it would be incumbent on the united states to make compensation the papers now communicated will more particularly apprize you of these transactions the vexations and spolitation understood to have been committed on our vessels and commerce by the cruizers and officers of some of the belligerent powers appeared to require attention the proofs of these however not having been brought forward the description of citizens supposed to have suffered were notified that on furnishing them to the executive power due measures would be taken to obtain redress of the past and more effectual provisions against the future should such documents be furnished proper representations will be made thereon with a just resistance on a redress proportioned to eh exigency of the case the british government having undertaken by orders to the commanders of their armed vessels to restrain generally our commerce in corn and other provisions to their own ports and those of their friends the instructions now communicated were immediately forwarded to our minister at that court in the mean time some discussionson the subject took place between him and them these are also laid before you and i may expect to learn the result of his special instructions in time to make it known to the legislature during their present sessions very early after the arrival of a british minister here mutual explanation on the execution of the treaty of peace were entered into with that minister these are now laid before you for your information on the subjects of mutual interest between this country and spain negociations and conferences are now depending the public requiring that the present state of those should be made known to the legislature in confidence only they shall be the subject of a separate and subsequent communication g washington mr madison reported the draft of an answer to the address of the president the remainder of this sitting was employed in beginning the reading of the papers received from the president which are voluminous winchester may two men named timmons brothers as also one nimrod higgins were killed in the wilderness between yellow creek and cumberland mountain about the th ult by indians three persons were also lately killed by indians in harrison county near the mouth of the little kennaway by a letter from the territory south of the ohio dated april we learn that on the d of that month a large party of indians killed sever person within seven miles of knoxville and stole horses from knox county that parties of them are daily committing ravages in the territory and that there is no prospect of putting a stop to their enormities while the whites are restricted from pursuing them across the tenessee united states june gentlemen of the senate and of the house of representatives lay before congress the copy of a letter with its enclosure from the secretary of state to the minister plenipotentiary of his britannic majesty it being an answer to a letter from the mnister to him bearing date the ult and already communicated geo washington philadelphia june sir if the letter with which you honoured me on the d ult had not entered into a train of recrimination against the united states i should not now trouble you with a return to its unpleasant topics among the reasons which would have induced me to add nothing to my letter the st of lat month its would have been of some weight that by silence i should avoid the repetition of a style and manner which seem to have produced a personal excitement as you are willing to admit the authenticity of lord dorcester's speech we will with your approbation reserve for a future discussion on what occasion and to what degree an explanation may be required by the government of the united states from a foreign minister i selected only one passage of that speech because in it was concentrated the real object of the whole which was to declare an expectation that great britain would be at war with the united states in the course of the present year and if she were to cause the warriors to draw a line this is the undisguised sense of the governorgeneral unaffected by the preliminary words which you have thought proper to quote it is your own interpretation for so far are you from contradicting my assertion that lord dorchester fostered and encouraged in the indians hostile dispositions towards us that you continue the greater part of your remaining observations to vindicate his persuasion and your own that the principal aggression leading to hostility proceeded from the united states and to suggest many others of the same tendency upon which you would not dilate i shall not shrink sir from your charges st notwithstanding the territory upon which certain inhabitants of vermont are presented in your letter of the th of july to have trespassed belong to the united states yet on the th of the same month did my predecessor give you as is admitted positive assurances of the determination to discourage and repress the subject of your complaint the necessary instructions were accordingly forwarded to that state on examining your correspondence with my department it does not appear that from the th of july to the th of march upwards of nineteen months our government ever unrdestood from yourself or any authority ofhis britannic majesty that the original dissatisfaction continued nor was any discontent heard from that quarter through other channels except what related to outrages upon our own citizens by british subjects then indeed thirty days after the hostile tribes of indians had been assembled by lord dorchester at quebec you renewyour remonstrance although it cannot be by any means believed that this was written in order to ausher in the intelligence which soon after arrived on his speech ye tit is difficult to account for so long an interval under the circumstances supposed nor ought my answer although delayed for fifty days until the th of april to be constured into an assent to any charge since at the end of that period having been disappointed as my letter shews in one opportunity of information and no other presenting itself we were not in a capacity of contradicting your assertions however sir the instructions issued in consequence of your application conveyed positive orders for the correction of what upon examination should be found irregular d among the points to which you intimate that you might have adverted is enumerated the fitting out of two privateers at charleston south carolina whatever this transaction might have been it probably occurred at the commencement of the war and before the existence of the war was communicated to our government by any of the powers engaged had such a transaction been known to the president in time you can well judge from his actual conduct what he would then have done his proclamation on the nd of april his call upon the state governors on the th of the same months to cooperate with him in the work of impartiality and peace the system of rules which he established and which were imparted to you are unerring indications of the spirit of those measures on which he had determined he suppressed the consular courts which attempted to pass sentences of condemnation on captures he restored several vessels to british owners prosecutions have been instituted against the violaters of neutrality in a word sir what has been required under the sanction of the law of nations which had not been fulfilled how many thingshave been spontaneously done to evince our impartiality let me request you to review my predecessorâ€™s letters to you of april may june august september and and to say if more could be well expected from us after such demonstrations it might have been hoped that the equipment of these two privateers would not rise again in the shape of a charge but the letter of the th of june being conceived of itself to be satisfactory is here inserted in the letter which i had the honour of writing you on the th of may in answer to your several memorials of the th of that month i mentioned that the president reserved for further consideration a part of the one which related to the equioment of two privateers in the port of charleston the part alluded to was that wherein you express your confidence that the executive government of the united states would pursue measures for represeeing such practices in the future and for restoring to their rightful owners any captures which such privateers might be bring into the ports of the united states the presidentafter a full investigation of this subject and the most mature consideration has charged me to communicate to you that the first part of this application is found to be jest and that effectual measures are taken for preventing repetitions of the act therin complained of but that the latter part desiring restitution of the prizes is understood to be inconsistent with the rules which govern such cafes and would therefore be unjustifiable towards the other party the principal agents in this transaction were french citizens being within the united states at the moment a war broke out between their own and another country they determine to go in its defence they purchase arm and equip a vessel with their own money man it themselves receive a regular commission from their nation depart out of the united states and then commence hostilities by capturing a vessel if under these circumstancethe commission of the captors was valid the property according to the laws of war was by the capture transferred to them and it would be an aggression on their nation for the united states to rescue it from them whether on the high seas or on coming into their ports if the commission was not valid and consequently the property not transferred by the laws of war to the capture then the case would have been cognizable in our courts of admiralty and the owners might have gone thither for redress so that on neither supposition would the executive be justifiable in interposing with respect to the united states the transaction can in no wise be imputed to them it was in the first moment of the war—in one of the their most distant port—before measures could be provided by the government to meet all the cases which such a state of things was to produce impossible to have known and therefore impossible to have been prevented by that government the moment it was known the most energetic orders were sent to every state and port in the union to prevent a repetition of the accident on a suggestion that citizens of the united states had taken part in the act one who was designated was instantly committed to prison for prosecution one or two others have been since named and committed in like manner and should it appear that there were still others no measures would be spared to bring them to justice the president had even gone farther he has required as a reparation of their breach of respect to the united states that the vessels so armed and equipped shall depart from our ports you will see sir in these proceedings of the president unequivocal proofs of the line of strict right which he means to pursue the measures now mentioned are taken in justice to the one part the ulterior measure of seizing and restoring the prizes is declined in justice to the other and the evil thus early arrested will be of very limited effects perhaps indeed soon disappear altogether as to the permission from the governor of south carolina departures of privateers you may assure yourself of a proper inquiry and i take the liberty of requesting any evidence which you may have of it with so many direct proofs in your hands of the opinion constantly maintained by our government against the legality of captures in general made by illegal privateers it is not easily explained why the validity of those before the th of june should be argued from a refusal to restore them the above received letter of that date neither affirms nor disaffirms their validity but declines the granting of restitutions being inconsistent with the rules which govern such cases those ruled are that if the commission be good the capture is good if the commission be bad the capture is bad but whether it be good or bad is not decided it being enough to prove that the transaction for the reasons assigned can in no wise be imputed to the united states but if captures of this kind prior to the th of june do really amount as is conceived by some to no very considerable value this would of itself lessen the importance of the insinuation th the secretary of war has undertaken to ascertain the precise state of the privateers le petit democrate and la carmagnole and the result will be communicated to you in the mean time it is a matter of some surprise that vessels whose single employment and profit must consist in cruizing on the ocean should have remained in the port of newyork during the whole winter and probably up to the date of your letter may d may it not be presumed that their activity has been checked by the intervention of the government but sir if they have not been dismantled your letter brings the first notice of the omission th it is true that the sale of prizes made by french cruizers has not been prohibited in the united states and that our treaty with france has been so interpreted as not to contemplate a freedom to sell the next resort was to the law of nations which was scrupulously searched by the executive with the pure desire of discovering truth and justice to all upon this as on many other occasions the civilians differ vattel declaring that a privateer may carry his prize into a neutral port and there freely sell it martens affirming the same doctrine if it has not been otherwise regulated by treaty and others opposing it in this sxhism among the writersit was resolved by the president of the united states to impose no restraint upon those sales and to refer them as affairs of legislation to congress at the earliest moment of their session thus much has been observed not as my final anser but merely to introduce an assurance that i will follow you in the main discussion whensoever you shall bring it forward in detail th undoubtedly sir you have been misinformed that the vessels of france have been permitted to depart from our ports notwithstanding the embargo as the history of the executive proceedings is neither long nor entangled it shall be frankly stated to you as soon as the embargo was laid expresses and advice boats were dispatched to notify the officer of the customs and revenue cutters and all others concerned in its execution the resolution imposing it involved all foreign nations the instructions from the united states favoured no nation directly or indirectly a french snow la camille which had descended the river delaware as low as newcastle on her voyage was stopped by an officer of the united states and the president adhering to perfect impartiality could not think himself justified to gratify the minister of the french republic with a passport passports being kept under the special view of the president were issued only after his examinatino of each case and the total number of them does not exceed twentysix among them was one to yourself one to an agent who was sent to the westindies upon a business connected with the late captures and condemnation in various british courts of admiralty one to a citizen whose vessel was under trial in bermuda and who was anxious to forward the british instructions of the th january with a hope of rescuing her from confiscation one to the friends of joshua barney then in jamica twenty for the accomodation of several unfortunate inhabitants of st domingo to some of whome our government was advancing money for their support and who could no longer endure their separation from home one to some other persons in peculiar circumstances desirous of returning to the westindies and in the last instance one to the minister of the french republic if therefore by any other passport or permission the embargo has been relaxed it was unauthorized by the president and unlawful the distance of hampton road from this city being more than three hundred miles the officers of government resident here could not learn at the moment what was passing there no intelligence of an official nature of any real importance no complaint from any other foreign minister or any othe rpseron has since reached us if sir you should happen to possess the information i ask it as a favour of you to designate who granted the permission and under what circumstances the french vessels left that road an investigation however has been and shall be pursued on our part without delay if the law has been violated it shall be vindicated but a violation of law is very remote from a permission of the government th the uniformly unfriendly treatment which the british officers are said to have experienced in the united states cannot be answered until it shall be more explicitly defined did this treatment break forth in words or actions not cognizable by law if so no complaint can be offered to government or in words or action which were so cognizable our courts are free to foreigners against citizens and independent of influence to yourself let me appeal that on the representations which you thought proper to lay before the president in relation to the british consul at baltimore the british consul at norfolk and the commander of the daedalus frigate the necessary measures were promptly adopted the result has been transmitted to you and no objection has been returned nor was the government backward in its interference in the late affair of philadelphia and these eing the only occurrences of the kind within my knowledge i trust that no example can be produced of government refusing to extend its protection on every seasonable occasion th the events at newport in rhodeisland are accurately detailed in the proceedings which i have the honour of enclosing to you within the limits of the present letter i cannot do more as it might be an useless talk to detain you with remarks when non of them might be adapted to the animadversions which you mediate it is enough therefore for me to engage that these animadversions whenever they shall appear shall receive particular attention although sir your charges against the united states are sketched only the impression which may have been intended cannot be counteracted too soon by such general elucidations as at a future day may be more minutely unfolded but let these facts be as they will are they indicative of a hostile disposition in the united states and ought they ultimately to produce a state of war this is not the place for us to retort our complaints but compare them with the whole of your catalogue and say what may our feeling be yet we prefer peace th as lord dorchester's endeavour to stir up the indians against us is without justification so is the expedition of governor simcoe without pretext that you have received no intelligence of such an event having actually occurred leaves room to conjecture that you may not be without intelligence of it having been designed and that it has therefore probably taken place but you insist that much will depend on the place intended for the fort let the point allotted for it on the miami be unknown the place is for our immediate purpose adequatley market out by eing on the river a single glance of the eye over the map proves that its source is within the limits of the united states in its whole length it is flanked on each side by our territory its very mouth is to the southward of our line as recognised by our treaty with his britannic majesty on no part therefore of the rapids can a fort be built but within out country this being fixed your argument is that if the fort be for the purpose of protecting subjects of his majesty residing in districts dependent on the fort of detroit or of preventing that fortress from being straitened by the approach of the american army the principle of statu quo until the final arrangement of the point in discussion between the two countries shall be concluded will strictly apply to change by hostile movements the condition of a thing concerning which a treaty is opened not being consonant with the spirit of adjustment the principle of statu quo has been generally adopted the nearest point of the rapids to detroit cannot be less than fifty miles they have never been considered they never could be considered as appending to detroit but you proceed and say tha tthe proposed assumption of territory may depend on districts which depend on detroit it is too obvious to dwell upon the remark that if detroit which lies within the united states becomes the first station from which a district may be generated one encroachment may beget another ad infinitum it will however be very acceptable to understand with accuracy how much of our territory towards the miami was actually possessed by the military establishment of detroit at the time of peace i mention the military establishment because if any subjects of his britainnic majesty reside beyond the line of actual possess they are as being within our limits under our jurisdiction to prevent the fortress of detroit from being straitened by the approach of the american army is either a new modification of the preceding idea or founded upon a untenable suspicion for the question must recur are the rapids an appendage to detroit were they connected with it at the peace if convenience only were to be consulted and a wide range of unsettled territory by being suitable to the momentary circumstances of one nation is to be transferred for that reason alone from another which is the true proprietor we might even then controvert the conveniency of the rapids to detroit if right be consulted our right is complete is then our territory to be thus seized nay more sir i am authorized to say to you explicitly that the american army has no instructions to straiten or annoy that post and that if the descent on the rapids was dictated by this consideration it ought to be discontinued without cause i have the honour sir to be with great respect your most obedient servant edm randolph mr hammond minister plenipotentiary of his britannic majesty true copy geo taylor jun message from general washington to congress may gentlemen of the senate and of the house of representatives i lay before you certain information whereby it would appear that some encroachment as about to be made on our territory by an officer and party of british troops proceeding upon a supposition of the authenticity of this information although of a private nature i have caused the representation to be made to the british minister a copy of which accompanies this message it cannot be necessary to comment upon the very serious nature of such an encroachment nor to urge that this new state of things suggests the propriety of placing the united states in a posture of effectual preparation for an event which notwithstanding the endeavours making to avert it may y circumstances beyond our controul be forced upon us g washington by a letter from mr randolph the american secretary of state to mr hammond the information alluded to we find to be that governor simcoe had gone to the foot of the rapids of teh miami followed by three companies of a british regiment in order to build a fort there—which mr hammond in his answer rather qualifies than denies in the debate in congress on taking off the embargo several members said they had voted for the embargo merely as a part of a general plan of retaliation upon great britain but that as the more effential parts of that plan particularly the prohibiting of all commercial intercourse between america and great britain had been overruled the embargo was injurious only to the subjects of teh united states and therefore ought to be taken off in philadelphia and several other ports the masters and mates of american ships held meetings and published resolutions declaring that they would not put to sea until they could be assured that their flag would be respected and their persons protected from such indignities as many of them had lately experienced this they did after the embargo was at an end philadelphia june [ authentic] copy of a letter from general wilkins to col c biddl dated pittsburgh d may i this moment received yours of the th inst i arrived about fifteen minutes ago from le boeuf and left the detachment there well

sandusky where he had been left by the senecas last fall sick—he says the lieutenant governor of upper canada m'kee and elliot the indian agent the two last refugees from this country were visiting all the indian towns in that quarter and exciting them to continue their opposition to the americans and assuring them of support from their father the british monarch he further adds that they were ready for fighting gen wayne the moment he moved and that the british were erecting garrisons at the miami river heconfirms the accounts of the other indians that they were determined to oppose the

according to the order of the day resolved itself into a committee of the whole house on the report of the committee to whom was referred the remonstrance of the people west of the alleghany mountains relative to the navigation of the river mississippi and after some time spent therein mr speaker resumed the chair and mr trumbull reported that the committee according to order had the same report under consideration and come to a resolution thereupon which he delivered in at the clerk's table where the same was twice read and agreed to by the house as follows resolved that as it appear from the communications of the executive that the right of the united states to the free navigation of the mississippi is now the subject of negotiation with the court of spain and as it is the interest of the united states and every part thereof to come to an amicable adjustment of the right in that mode rather than resort to any means constitutionally belonging to the legislature no farther proceeding should be had on the said remonstrance during the present session of congress extract from the journal american papers are received dated october they contain two letters from general wayne to the american secretary at war giving an account of a severe action he had with the indi ans who were assisted by the volunteers and militia of detroit on the th august on the banks of the miamis in the vicinity of the british post and garrison at the foot of the rapids—the action was bloody and he says our army was left in full and quiet possession of the field of battle which terminated under the influence of the guns of the british garrison as you will observe by the inclosed correspondence which passed between major camp bell commandant and myself upon the occasion he adds—we remained three days and nights on the banks of the miamis in front of the field of battle during which time all the houses and corn fields were consumed and destroyed for a con siderable distance both above and below fork mia mis as well as within pistol shot of that garrison who were compelled to remain tacit spectators to this general devastation and conflagration among which were the stores and houses of colonel mac kee the british indian agent and principal stimu lator of the war now exiting between the united states and the savages the american paper from which this account is taken does not give the correspondence above alluded to but concludes the article thus besides the very important papers which we have been able to offer to our readers this day the executive we understand has received copies of a correspondence between the british major camp bell and general wayne the major begins it by inquiring of the general by what authority he came there the general answers by requiring to know who gave campbell authority to establish a fort at that place it being within our side of the treaty boundary and no such establishment there when that instrument was signed we hope ere long our gallant general will give a good account of this mr campbell coroner's inquest—an inquest was held yesterday evening before anthony gell esq at the nag's head in grangecourt leicestersquare on the body of ann paris an unfortunate young creature of interesting appearance not more than years of age who it appeared had been reduced by some unknown melancholy circumstance to the most forlorn and destitute situations it was stated in evidence that she had taken her lodgings only seven weeks and that during that time she had evinced the most wretched state of mind and on thursday morning urged on by the poignancy of her feelings or derangement of her intellect she swallowed a considerable quantity of laudanum on the violence of her deathpangs coming on medical air was sent for but too late to be of any assistance and in a short time she expired—the coroner's jury returned a verdict of lunacy the history of this poor young creature is at once romantic and interesting she is the daughter of a monsieur paris who was well known in the commencement of the revolution and in which he suffered madame paris with her infant daughter took refuge in this country and in the ruin of her fortune became a governess in a noble family in scotland after this she had a house in the newroad and about two years ago died of the rupture of a blood vessel her daughter had been placed at an eminent

traced by her guardian and separated jones declared that she was virtuous and his intentions were honourable and as a proof of it he was ready to marry her with her guardian's consent in effect they were married and she was completely undone in about a fortnight or three weeks jones threw off his disguise and fairly told her his real character— that he was no sailor but lived by his shifts that he had married her only for the sum her protector had paid him and that she must provide for herself she was abandoned and the shock had such an effect on her imagination that she has ever since shewed signs of a disordered intellect with a heart that shrunk from vice she was flung on the world without a friend or a home and in this deplorable state she became the victim of necessity about three weeks ago she saw an officer who is distinguished for his gallantries and who by his address and attentions so won upon her affections that she could neither speak nor think of any other object this fatal attachment absorbed her whole soul they entered into engagements to live and die only for one another and in the frenzy of this passion or under the idea that she could not be his and his alone she took the desperate resolution of dying for him she had prepared three phials of opium who of which she swallowed and she died with a spirit of heroism for no persuasion nor force could make her when seized with the nausea of the poison take any antidote to the draughts she would not suffer the medical men to approach her—and though after stupefaction came on they administered every known medicine they all failed of effect on friday an inquest was held at the nag's head leicesterfields on the body of madamoiselle ann paris then lying dead at no st martin'sstreet leicesterfields—sarah

appeared to be rather flighty and tiresome in her manner such as ringing the bell violently giving orders and almost immediately after giving counterorders at other times she would ring with equal violence and when any of the servants inquired what she wanted she would tell them she wanted nothing she was also extremely incoherent in her discourse rambling from one subject to another with the utmost rapidity and without there being the least connection between each in answer to a question from one of the jurymen the witness said that the deceased was by no means in the habit of drinking but that on the day on which the unfortunate affair took place she thought the deceased appeared wild as if she had been drinking at one time the deceased told the witness that some one had said she

she died before daylight on thursday morning the witness knew nothing of any particular visitor to the deceased neither had she the least knowledge of any of her relations or friends mr emanuel gristock of wardourstreet surgeon stated that between ten and eleven on wednesday night he saw the deceased she refused all medicine that was offered her for the purpose of expelling the poison with some difficulty however the witness forced part of an emetic down her throat she said she new she had done wrong and in disjointed sentences and in broken accents raved something about her loving a young man upon examining her apartment the witness found one small bottle full of laudanum and two others empty which evidently had contained the same sort of poisonous liquid their contents must have been between two and three ounces he left the patient at twelve being under the necessity of attending another at knights bridge mr james wilkes of the haymarket surgeon saw the deceased at half after two on thursday morning she was then in a state of actual torpor the nervous system appeared to be totally deranged and she was incapable of making the least exertion with her body or limbs she appeared to be past all hopes of recovery from the moment the witness saw her however having been previously apprised of the situations of the patient the witness had taken a bottle containing an emetic in his pocket with the utmost difficulty he forced part of it down her throat but it had no effect—the patient continued in the same torpid state until five o'clock in the morning when she expired dr hooper prescribed some other medicines which we attempted to be administered ut in vain the patient was totally incapable of swallowing them a jeweller had known the young lady for a considerable length of time he had served her with a variety of trinkets in his line of business and was in the constant habit of attending her two or three times a week he had frequently observed the poor unfortunate young lady act with the utmost inconsistency and wildness he had repeatedly known her to burst into tears in the midst of apparent merriment he had known her to order clothes to dress for going out then turn short and saw she would not go out that day and he had known her once after sitting for some time in the most pensive mode imaginable start up suddenly and exclaim no i will not stand this she was between and years of age he understood that she was born in france but she spoke english as well as french the day before the occurance of the melancholy transaction which was the subject of the prevsent consideration of the jury she had with frenzy depicted in her countenance exclaimed well if my wishes are not fulfilled i shall hang or drown myself the witness had not the least knowledge of what she alluded to neither had he ever heard that she had any relations in london he was most decidedly of opinion that she was deranged in her intellects the jury without a

extract of a letter from london sept the new duties established by congress on goods are the same through all the states are so trifling are they in comparison of the taxes placed in any part of europe on goods imported from britain—many are only a half per cent and the highest percent some very few articles excepted clearly point out that without british customs they cannot subsist our merchants ly are exporting immense quantities of these to the thirteen united states not only from london but from liverpool bristol &c it is doubtful but that many of the adventurers de may be

from the baron de clugny whether he avows the fact if he does probably it may bring an open rupture as out troops and ships may be sent down to protect it the american congress have laid on port duties which may be deemed moderate in several particulars when compared to those of most of the european kingdoms and cities and in many instances are much less than heretofore imposed by the provincial assemblies this may be hugly prudent in a republic which is courting commerce for her ports and for such a variety of articles the native products of that extensive region to give in return

in justice the insurrections among the slaves in the french west india islands form a dismal presage of what we may expect in our own we have managed this business not like men of sense concerned in a general welfare of the british empire but with the pedantry and precipitation of school boys from some late communications it is evident that as much sugar may be made on the new lands in the states of newyork and pennsylvania as will supply the whole united states and perhaps in a little time furnish an article of exportation the profits of the manufactory of sugar when made by private families will be greater than when made by large works a boiler which will cost only s will be the whole expence that will be necessary to carry on this business and the sugar may be made at a season of the year when no work can be done upon a farm the price of it when sent to philadelphia will be twice as high as the same quantity of wheat the sugar trees may be made to yield their juice without being injured and when they decay fresh ones may easily be cultivated in the soil upon which they now grow when we consider the value of sugar its general and wholesome use in diet and above all that it has hitherto been obtained at the price of the lives and liberty of our african brethren we cannot help congratulating our fellow citizens upon the prospect of manufactories of that article being

the last season to british america it will be dispatched on the th of next month from the post office a short description of and remarks upon a new state called the western territory being one of four settled by the americans since that no nation can serve the americans with good equal in quality and price to britain is what the whole world knows and from experience the most obstinate rebel american dare not deny it is with pleasure therefore we inform our readers that the united states are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures—they have already laid out four new states since the beginning of their rebellion viz vermont kentucky indiana and the western territory about seventeen years ago vermont was a wilderness they only began to settle it about the year kentucky ten years ago lay in forest wild it was settled in yet so rapid has been the population that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants already in each of these states the state of indiana was only laid off this present year and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants from a description of these four states published in american in may last we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them called the western territory and it must rerejoiced the heart of every briton to read it and think that the settling of these countries though the americans double their numbers every or years will long keep them from manufacturing and is every day opening a field for new customers to great britain for who will work as a tradesman even though wages are very high when he can for twenty pounds purchase a thousand acres of land that being the present price fixed by congress for lots of land in the western territory—hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of america—desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect that new channels of commerce will be opened and the inland parts of the continent will require an incresing supply—british manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that continent and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation will be diffused through a country more fertile more susceptible of population and six time more extensive than all the thirteen united states the western territory is the name given to this new state by congress it is bounded on the west by the mississippi riverlb>—north by the lakes—east by pennsylvania—south and southeast by the ohio reiver contains according to mr hutchins geographer general to the congress square miles equal to two hundred and sixtythree millions of acres from which he deducts fortythree millions of acres for water there will then remain two hunred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the foederal government which is to be sold for the discharthe debt owing to the united states but a very small proportion of theselands is yet purchased of the native indians and disposed of by congress* on the lands which have been purchased by congress from the indians two settlements and already commenced*—one at marietta the other at miami this state was only laid out by congress in the end of the year and already contains about inhabitants the principal rivers are the mississippi ohio muskingham hockhocking sioto miami wobash &c—coal and iron mines and salt pits abound in this state the soil is excellent—as rich as can be imagined and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour it is exceeding healthy pleasant and commodious—the most fertile sport of earth known to the europeans or americans—exceeding the soil of any of the united states the timber is tall and in great variety—streams for mills abound here wheat indigo hemp and cotton thrive well many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties and justify the descrpition of travellers who call it the *garden of of a great empire will be fixed in some future pethe world* it is here probably also that the centre riod it is the most centrical place for congress to accomodate themselves at no country is better stocked with wild game of every kind herds of deers elks bear &c fill the extensive meadows of this country—turkies geese swans and partridges &c are innumerable the rivers are excellently stored with fish and almost all navigable for small sloops in the ordinance published by congress for the government of this territory they are to be allowed an assembly when their number amounts to persons' and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in congress and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into states rejoice o britons that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you and you *only* *no more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives for which congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum the american trade gets better in very sense —the orders increase and the payment is much more certain than heretofore by an extract of a letter from jamaica we learn the following singular fact—the captain and crew of the brig exuma which arrived there some days before from newfoundland having in the course of their passage fallen in with a french schooner captain alward asked the captain of the schooner to accommodate him with some nails which he politely did at the same time begging his acceptance of some barracoutes caught that morning captain aylward and his crew having dined off them the same day they were immediately seized with violent sickness convulsive fits and other dangerous symptoms the captain judging that the fish they had eaten were of a poisonous nature conceived that salt water might be of service he instantly made the expedient on himself which relieved him greatly he applied the same remedy to his crew and it was attended with good effects when this unfortunate accident happened it was luckily a dead calm had the weather been tempestous it is more than probable the ship and crew would have been lost as during their sickness there was not a man able to stand by the helm by letters received from norfolk in virginia dated the rd of july we learn that on the th of that month the ship betsey of greenock capt james young had arrived there in days from jamaica and brought the following melancholy relation which he received from the crew of the prudence whom she picked up on the st of juin lat long that from the th to the th of june the weather had been very hazy with little wind so that capt addies could not get an observation and a strong current setting to the southward and westward drove them farther leeward than they imagined on the th about o'clock in the morning the watch discovered cape catuloh but before intelligence could be given to the captain she struck for some time she made no water but about seven the water came in so fast that by eleven o'clock a m the water was six feet in the hold the depth of the water in which she lay the people being sixteen in number took to their long boat and endeavoured to make cape antonie but after four days fruitless labour they were obliged to return to the wreck where they found two spaniards plundering who informed them that there were only four inhabitants on the island and therefore they could receive no assistance from them upon which having taken a quantity of beef and biscuits aboard they left the wreck a second time and after having been absent fourteen days were providentially picked up by the ship betsey and carried to norfolk in virginia the prudence was from jamaica bound to london and had upwards of hogsheads of sugar and rum on board yesterday a large entry of goods for georgianewyork new providence and new brunswick to the amount of upwards of one hundred and sixty thousand pounds were entered at the customhouse the cherokee chiefs are not to be presented at court after seeing every thing of notoriety in london and other parts of the kingdom they will again return to americain the spring a singular revolution has taken place at martinique the governor viscount damas with the troops had taken possession of st pierre's having established peace as they concluded they retired to fort bourbon the patriots again at ed have suprised and taken the fort the governor has escaped with a company of grenadiers and it is reported he is since joined by about five hundred people of colour on friday died at his seat at cromford the celebrated sir richard arkwright who introduced the spinning of cotton on jennies this gentleman was once a barber that shaved at a penny but by this abilities raised himself to the state of immense opulence and established the cotton manufacture for which this country owes him the greatest obligation it is said that the profits of his works for several years past have amounted to forty thousand pounds a year there have been an amazing number of recruiting parties here these days by gone and i dare say they have got among them at least recruits this week only in two or three particular instances have large sums been given—the bounty is generally from to guineas this place is at present full of people many of whom may be said to have no more than what keeps soul and body together—i heartily wish they would also take away our loose women—they were never so numerous nor so troublesome if it was not for the recruiting service and the prospect of a bridewell which it is hoped our magistates will shortly set seriously about we would have but dismal prospects before us the ensuing winter—i am informed government propose sending of our bad women—they would never be missed out of this place
