We are curious to know what foreigners will say of our new commercial arrangements. Among ourselves there is but one opinion, and that is faavourable. o our own vessels, a preference is undoubtedly due; and among foreign vessels and merchandise, there is no discrimination in our import and tonnage acts, every nation being on the same footing. With respect to the duties themselves, they could not be laid lower, considering the demand of supplies, which the Committee appointed to give in an estimate state at upwards of eight millions of dollars. Accustomed to disappointment in hopes of improvement in politics and commerce, we feel a reluctance to entertaining very sanguine wishes. Yet appearances encourage the expecttion of the f–deral government's acting with the energy and effect that will give it respectability. The prejudices and animosities created by the late contest are gradually dying away ; and to the idleness and dissipation flowing from the same source, industry has in a great degree succeeded. A progress has also been made in manufactures of various kinds that was not expected ; and the persevering in them affords a strong presumption of those concerned deriving advantage. Throughout the union, the public opinion on matters of government has of late experienced rapid changes. Vice President Adams, in his highly esteemed work, has fully demonstrated the absurdity of democracy, and the superior excellence of a mix form, such as that of Britain. His deductions from premises admitted as just, have abated much of the popular aversion to monarchy ; and as every thing matures quickly in our transatlantic soil, it would not surprise many, were United America to have a sovereign earin the next century. In no one instance has our new admnistration given general satisfaction, more than in their conduct towards the Indians. The interests of those unfortunate people will be studiously attended to ; and they will be effectually protected against the lawless violence of the individuals or States, who wished to wrest their lands from them. This determination is dictated by policy as well humanity ; for it is now become the interest of the States to check, by every means short of violence, the erratic disposition of their citizens, who, when removed to the wilds beyond the mountains, cannot be regarded as of any value, in a political view.  ID69 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	08 	16 	inform 	By recent letters from America we learn, that the Congress of the nited States, after warm debates in both Houses, particularly in that of the Representatives, passed an act for the purpose of fixing permanently their seat of Government at German Town in Pennsylvania. The two new provinces in North America, Kentucky and Vermont, whose population already is so very considerable, were formed by the vast numbers of inhabitants who fled from the destruction and ravages of the unhappy contest between Great Britain and her colonies, and though the greatest part of them were then deemed loyalists, yet they have now jooined the American confederation. Seated on the banks of the great river Mississippi, far to the westward of all the other states, they can either navigate northerly to the lakes, or southerly to the Spanish settlements on the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico, and carry on a lucrative trade with the Indians. They are possessed of as fertile a tract of country as any in the world, the position of which they??? also s???d by navigable rivers to Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, and from thence, as their views???tend, to every country in Europe. Thus, from the most distressed situation, to rise to opulence and independence ina few years, must excite admiration. Agriculture, at present, seems to be the peculiar province of American industry, from whence wealth will flow into every part of that vast country, as it abounds in large tracts of rich land, level grounds, with a deep soil, and extended savannahs; while to the northward the fisheries and shipbuilding amply compensate for the want of an equal fertility; and though not so abundant in coin, yet the provinces produce the finest meadows, form whence a provision trade will be every year increasing. The southern countries of Europe, not affording sufficient crops of grain for the support of their inhabitants, on account of the remarkable encrease of population, and which is still augmenting, as arts and manufacturers are every where extended: America may, therefore, be deemed, in future, the granary of this quarter of the globe.  ID140 	Aberdeen Journal 	Aberdeen 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1819 	05 	26 	inform 	Colonial Intelligence Some Canada papers to the 11th let. have arrived in town. Sir Peregrine Maitland had summoned the Parliament of Upper Canada to meet him at York, on the 22d of April. He had appointed Port Talbot in the town of Dunwich, a port of entry, in the same manner as those established between Canada and the United Statess. Extract of a letter to a Gentleman in George-town, dated Tobago, Feb. 9. 1819.–' The heavy rains which continued during the months of December and January, almost inundated the country, which brought on a most rapid and fatal disease, which made its first appearance in the frost, at a short distance from the town, consisting of 212 men strong, and in 10 or 12 days, 45 of that number were numbered with the dead. The contagion was so rapid, that it soon spread into the town, shipping, and country, and proved equally fatal. The disorder was such, it baffled all medical aid. The alarming symptoms were such, that business was nearly suspended–the white population seeking safety in other islands, or in the remote and healthiest part of this. I assure you, that every thing had a most gloomy appearance ; and the disease was so contagious, one man would hardly venture to touch another. The William's crew, from their mutinous disposition, deserted her–some have since died ; and some remain sick. The weather has become good within these fifteen days, and the health of the island improving fast.' A series of Sierra Leone Gazettes, to the 20th of February, have reached us. They contain no intelligence of particular interest, expect that the colony appears to have been healthy at that period. In one of them we find a contradiction of the reports which found their way into the English papers some months since of the dreadful mortality that prevailed in that settlement. It states that the total number of Europeans who died in the Peninsula in 1818, was eight men, three women, and two children. We lost no civil, military or colonial officer, excepting one young Gentleman who died a month after his arrival, and is included in the number. A letter from the Havannah, dated 27th February, mentions that the article of coffee is gradually rising in value, and that an agent from Messrs Baring is making purchases there to the amount of 1/3 a million sterling, in that single commodity.  ID251 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1835 	09 	16 	inform 	On Thursday evening a dinner was given to Captain Hindmarsh R.N., to celebrate the circumstance of his Majesty having graciously expressed his approbation of the choice of that gentleman to be the Governor of the new colony in South Australia. The entertainment took place at the Albion Tavern.  ID311 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1842 	03 	19 	inform 	Monument to the late Earl of Dur hum. –The New Zealand Company have voted t105, towards the erection of the monument to the Earl of Durham–the noble earl having been the first governor of this important company.  ID334 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	01 	10 	inform 	From the New York Journal. Winchester, Oct. 20. By recent intelligence from Kentucky we learn that a short time ago an American vessel was seized at New Orleans, and her cargo disposed of by the Spaniards. Also, that the troop which went out against the Indians had, not far from the banks of the Ohio, fallen in with about forty of them, whom they made their prisoners, after a slight resistance; and that having washed them, 15 turned out to be white men. Philadelphia, Nov 9. We hear from undoubted authority, that a considerable loan has been negotiated in Holland for the service of these United States. Albany, Nov. 4. The Legislature of Vermont have resolved to pay to the State of New York 30,000 dollars, agreeably to the first proposition contained in the declaration of the Commissioners of this State, appointed to declare the consent of the Legislature thereof, that a certain territory within the jurisdiction of the State of New York be erected into a new State on the 17th of October last; in consequnece whereof, all rights and titles to lands within the State of Vermont, under grants of the late colony of New York, or from the State of New York (except such grants as were intended as confirmations of those from New Hampshire) cease and determine. The Legislature have also resolved, that a Convention be called for taking into consideration the constitution of the United States; the members to be elected in December, and the Convention to Meet the first week in Jauary. The Legislature have adjourned to meet again on the first Thursday in January, for the purpose (we suppose) of choosing Senators, and affixing the time and manner of electing Representatives for Congress. New York, Nov. 18. The following resolution has passed the House of Representatives of the State of Virginia now in session: Resolved, That so much of this act, entitled, An Act, making provision for the provision for the debt of the United States in their redemption of the public debt, is dangerous to the rights, and subversive of the interest of the people; and demands the marked disapprobation of the General Assembly. Portland, Nov. 15. The stone work of the light house, at the entrance of our harbour, is now completed. On Tuesday the 9th instant, the last stone was laid by Mr. Nichols, of this town, master builder. The work is extremely well executed. The lighthouse is now 70 feet high. To this the lanthorn, which is to be six feet in diameter, will add about 15 feet, 85 feet in whole. The lanthorn is now preparing, and will probably be raised and lighted by the first of next month. Baltimore, Nov. 23. A society of respectable gentlemen of this place have raised an adequate fund for the establishment of an extensive manufacture of gunpowder, and the necessary mill-works will be speedily erected in the vicinity of this town. This important insituation will not only prove highly advantageous to this State and town, but may, if properly encouraged, become a national benefit. York (Pennsylvania), Nov 10. From Wright's Ferry we learn, that about four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, as a boat was coming from the East side, a most tremendous storm arose when she was about half way over, by which means she was soon filled with water, and sunk. there was six passengers and the??? in her (besides a small light waggon and three horses, viz. a clergyman, the owner of the waggon, with his wife and three children; when the storm came on, the woman and children took shelter in the waggon, but it continued to blow with such violence that the waggon was torn out of the boat, and the body having by chance got loose from the carriage, and being pretty tight, floated some distance till its progress was stopped by a rock; the husband, viewing the melancholy situations of his wife and children, resolved to relieve or perish with them, and quitting the boat swam to the waggon, cut open the cover with his knife, and with difficulty kept their heads above water till they were relieved by a boat from the West side; by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappeared; the Clergyman just as he found the boat sinking mounted his horse, one of the boatmen mounted on one of the waggon horses, and by this means preserved themselves till they were relieved by a boat; the other boatman of the name of Tim Sulivan, depending on his skill in swimming got up an oar, but it is thought he is drowned, as he has not since been heard of; the boat was found in the falls, and one of the waggon horses that had been given up for lost, was found next day some distance below the falls, with all his geers on, and does not appear to have received the least injury. Extract of a letter from Sunbury, Northumberland County (Pennsylvania), dated Nov. 13. One of the men who murdered the Indians at Pine Creek, was tried on Saturday evening, and though a number of witnesses clearly proved the hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed, and the confession of his counsel at the bar that confirmed it, yet, notwithstanding an express charge from the judges to bring him in guilty, the jury in a few moments returned with a verdict in his favour, and a subscription to pay the costs of the suit, that he might be immediately set at liberty; and all this from a most absurd idea, which the Attorney General, with all his endeavours, could not beat out of them, that the crime was not the same to kill an Indian as a white man: for some minuets the Chief Justice was mute with astonishment. How the State can pacify the Indians now, Heaven knows, while at this moment the other murderers are at large in this country, and no one will arrest them.  ID370 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1792 	09 	17 	inform 	EXTRACTS FROM LATE NEWSPAPERS. New York, July 5. This city and its vicinity were exceedingly alarmed, last Sabbath, about four o'clock, M. P. by a tremendous westerly tornado, which continued about 20 minutes, twisting off limbs of trees, unroofing houses, and tumbling down chimneys in various parts of the city. Unused to such unruly gusts, the citizens, particularly the fair, were thrown into a momentary d???ation. Terrible was the havoc on the water–in vain did the Sabbath breakers cry for mercy–in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, were they hurried to the bottom, and melancholy was the scene. It is said that 29 persons lost their lives in this neighbourhood, but we have not been able to ascertain who they were for certainty. Report says, that a Mr. Wade, his wife and two of their children, his brother, and a young man, were all, except the last mentioned, drowned from one boat near Yellow Hook, a few miles from the city. It is also said, a sloop overset with 16 persons, all but one of whom were drowned. We learn that the??? extended to Philadelphia, that ship was driven from her moorings there and sunk, and that the road from thence to this city, shrewn violent tokens of its visitation. July 14. The society for promoting the manufacture of maple sugar, met at Albany, July 3, have granted 75 dollars, bounty, to Thaddeus Scribner, of Herkermer county, for having produced 600 lb. of grained maple sugar, of superior quality– of 50 dollars to Comfort Cook, of Otsego, for producing sugar of equal quality, but a less quantity –and of 25 dollars to J. Harris, and R. Huntley, of Saratoga county, for the third rate quantity. The society resolved, to exhibit samples from each of these parcels to the legislature at their text session, in order to induce them to give larger bounties, for the further encouragement of this important manufacture. Aug. 4. On Saturday last, arrived in this city, directly from Scotland.–Nesbit, Esq. a gentleman who comes warmly recommended by the celebrated Dr. Robinson, and several other literary characters of eminence in that country, as a master of the science of canaling, from several years experience both in Holland and in Scotland. The President of the Northern Inland L.?. Company, attended by Mr. Nesbit, and a commitee of Directors, left this city, this morning on a tour, to explore the rive from Troy upwards, for the purpose of prosecuting the canals with spirit the remaining part of the season, and making preparations for its more active prosecution in the ensuing year. Philadelphia, July 12. Accounts from South Carolina and Georgia, with regard to their prospects of the ensuing crops, are very unfavourable, no rains of any consequence having fallen in the more eastern disctricts of these states since the beginning of April; at which time the low country was, in a manner inundaed. The Indigo plantations, when the last vessels sailed, were almost despaired of, for the next crop, and the rice swamps promised not much better. July 18. We are sorry to learn from New York, that spirit of party, respecting a late election of Governor of the State, has arisen to such a height as to have occasioned several duels a week. On Thursday morning last, Colonel W??? and Mr. Wilcocks, both of New York, had a meeting, and exchanged pistol shot, but their friends in??? prevented any bad consequences.–Colonel Willet is friendly to Governor Clinton's election, which Mr. Wilcock opposes. We hear from Maryland that a number of gentlmen of the state are about establishing a society in Port-To??? for the dissemination of useful political knowledge, the study of the constitution of their country, and the keeping up among the people if possible, a knowledge of their rights as free citizens of the greatest, and perhaps the only, true republic in the universe. August 6. On Thursday morning, was witnessed a very melancholy event at Mr. Henry Kizer's power mill, in lower Merion township, Montgomery country, between the hours of 9 and 10. There was a large quantity of powder in the mill, which by accident took fire and blew up with a great explosion, which was heard at Schuylkill ferry, and was there supposed to be an earthquake. Mr Kizer, and three others who were in the mill, were blown to pieces; and a Mr. Henry Fraily, a copartner of Mr. Kizer, was so wounded that his life is dispared of. A young woman who happened to be near the mill at the time it blew up, had both her legs broken, and was otherwise very much injured, by one of the rafters which was carried from the building in the violence of the explosion. Petersburgh, July10. We learn from North Carolina, that a fire broke out in the town of Washington, on Wednesday the 27th ult. which burn nearly half the town.–The loss in houses, goods, &c. is said to be very considerable. ???sburgh, July 21. Extract of a letter from Captain Paul, of the State Levies, dated Middle Block house, of the frontiers of Washington country, July 16, 1792. The Indians on Tuesday last killed two men and one woman, and stole seven horses between the states of Crays Creek and Col. Shepherd's in Ohio county, Virginia.–Lieut. Gray and fourteen of my men followed them over the Ohio, as far as the head of the Soufish, but the Indians being on horseback they returned without coming up with them. On Saturday last, at Dilly's station opposite the mouth of Grave creek, the Indians came into one of the houses and killed four and wounded one; the number of Indians was suppos ed to be twenty. It is thought they will strike this quarter. To-morrow morning I intend to start with a party to try and fall in with them. Martinsburgh, July 24. We are informed, that one day last week, a Mr. Barret, living near the South Branch, accidentally shot his wife;–he was fixing a flint to his gun, and incautiously dragging the trigger, not knowing the gun was loaded, discharged the whole contents into her body, and she died in a few moments after–the unfortunate woman had a young child at her breast, but it providentially received no injury. Alexander M'Gillivray advertises for a tutor, willing to instruct Indian children in the rudiments of the English language; and the first principles ofarithmetic. In the advertisement, this chief??? ??? ??? ??? of the Creek nation.
