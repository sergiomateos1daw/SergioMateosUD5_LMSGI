To my utter astonishment, my rustic landlord did not take in own newspaper; so there was I, stuck down, with my friend in the country–knowing no more of what passed in town than if I had been in Lapland. Intending every day should be my last, I went on without ordering your, or any other paper, till two months had passed away, at which period I returned to town. And there, Sir, I was quite a new man, and just as if I had dropped down from the clouds. Every day I heard people talking of occurrences of which I knew nothing : Revolutions in France by Fishwomen ; and battles in Flanders, against the Emperor, who I thought was fighting against the Turks. But even this was not the most distressing–for one day meeting a friend, I inquired very cordially after his wife, who I found a few days afterwards, had eloped just before with another gentleman ; and meeting with a lady, I inquired kindly for her sister, who I found had departed to the other world a fortnight before. On this account I never will stir again out of the world unless your paper goes along with me. I hold a newspaper to be a kind of viaticum with which every man should be provided, and which become the more necessary the further we remove from town It. is the only way to keep pace with what is going on every day in the fashionable or literary world–and to prevent talking about dead friends, or wives that have absconded. In short, Sir, a newspaper is my creed –and never will I again travel without my faith along with me : having fully experienced the unpleasantness of being sent back into the world as ignorant as if I had been born again– I hereby give notice – That if an hottentot friend of mine invites me, who does not take in your paper or some other– I will not visit him. DICK DESPERATE.  ID103 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1810 	06 	09 	inform 	Canada Extract of a letter from a Gentleman, to his Friend in Glasgow Quebec, March 23, 1810.–A number of leading characters among the Canadians, who were Members of the House of Assembly (twice dissolved for improper conduct) and the proprietor of a French paper, called La Canadien, have been arrested and thrown into jail, upon a charge of treasonable and seditious practises ; the printing press, types, &c. also taken possession of. This vigorous measure of Sir James Craig, has astonished the Canadians not a little, but the consequences will be no doubt beneficial to the country, as it has crushed a faction which has for some years been gaining strength, and acquiring dangerous influence over the minds of the inhabitants, who are without education, and ignorant, of course, in the extreme ; therefore easily misled by demagogues among their countrymen, who seize every opportunity of stirring up all those prejudices which the people of this country naturally have against the British : for, having been allowed to preserve their language, they are nearly as much Frenchmen now as they were at the conquest. Quebec, March 22.–On Sunday afternoon, the printer of the Canadien, Mr Charles Lafrancois was arrested and committed to jail, under a warrant from the Executive Council, on a charge of treasonable practises. On Monday evening, Dr Blanchet and Mr Bedard, and last evening Mr T. Taschereau, were also arrested, and committed by the same authority on the same charges. The Commander in Chief in Scotland gave an elegant dinner, at head-quarters, on the 4th curt. to celebrate the King's birthday-day–at which several of the Nobility and Gentry, Generals, and Field-Officers of the army, were present. Among the other accidents that occurred on the King's birth-day, from the imprudent use of gunpowder, is the death of girl in Richmond Street.– Her clothes were set fire by a squib, and, although immediately taken to the Infirmary, was so severely burnt, that she died before morning. A very melancholy accident happened at a place called the Pease, Berwickshire. As one of the baggage carts of the Forfarshire militia was stopping there, a fine boy about eight years of age, belonging to Serjeant-Major Nicol, got out of the cart, and was climbing on the wheel, when the horses suddengoing off, threw him on the ground, and the wheel passing over his body, crushed him to death. The unfortunate mother was upon the cart when this unhappy accident happened. On Thursday night, a spirit shop in Gibson-street, Glasgow, was broken into and about five pounds in silver, a seven shilling piece, about eight shillings of copper, a counterfeit half-guinea, and a pocket-book containing some bills and papers carried ; some partial payments are marked on the bills. The villains appear to have entered the shop by forcing up the window shutter with an iron bar, and then breaking a pane of glass, by which they got the iron bolts and the window opened. On Saturday last, a porter was killed in the hold of a vessel in Dundee harbour. He was engaged unloading coals ; and the rope by which the iron pully was supported, giving way, the measure fell down upon him, and killed him instantly. A few days ago, a mason, of the name of Stevenson, was killed by the blowing up of some stones, at Templeton, in the parish of Auchterhouse. The match unfortunately communicated too early to the powder, and the explosion took place before he could get out of the way. He has left a wife and two children to lament his loss.  ID122 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1818 	01 	01 	inform 	Emigration The authenticity of the following details of the miseries endured by some German emigrants proceeding from Amsterdam to America is, we are told, guaranteed ; otherwise they are almost too shocking to admit to belief : Libson, Nov. 4 We have just been witnesses here of an event which has renewed those gloomy reflexions which the friends of humanity have indulged ever since the commencement of the emigration from Germany and Switzerland to America. We have deplored the error which led so great a number of unhappy persons to expartiate themselves in the hope of finding a happier lot upon the shores of the new world. But it is less to the blindness of the victims of this error, than to the abominable speculations of cupidity that we are to attribute these numerous emigrations. the misery of the people of Germany and Switzerland, occasioned by a superabundance of population, and by the bad harvests of late years, serves for aliment to the avarice of certain men, who seek to establish criminal projects upon bases almost as obnoxious as those of the former slave trade. Such calculations deserve the attention of Governments, and it is with this view that we think is our duty to make known the fate of an expedition of this kind, fitted out at Amsterdam last August. But we shall first transcribe, from the original, the article of the charter party relative to the power reserved by the Captain over the persons of the passengers, as inlcuding stipulations which are most characteristic of the nature of that odious traffic :– We passengers, promise to fulfil faithfully the following conditions:– With respect to the price of the passage above stipulated, for so much as we have not yet paid, we engage to gain by our labour in America, what we owe, and we who owe the whole amount of our passage are bound, if required, and if we are unable to find better conditions, to hire ourselves for four or five years, in order to pay for our passage ; and we who have only paid for a part of our passage, equally promise to let ourselves out to work for the same time for the sum we still owe. We promise besides, we passengers, men or women, fathers or mothers, children and families here assembled, the children for their parents, the parents for their children, the brother for his brother, and the sister for her sister, when we shall find an opportunity to employ ourselves in America, to engage ourselves in service, and to answer for one for the other one for all the others, whether he be of our family or not, so that the price of the passage be diminished or augmented as much as shall be necessary, until we all and our families have employment, and the captain be no loser by us ; knowing very well that we passengers who have children, a family, brothers, and sisters, ought all to sumbit to our wives or husbands, our children, our brothers, our sisters, being sent separately to whatever place, in order to gain, in private service, profession, or labour, or in any manner that shall be deemed best, the price of our passage ; and in order that we may not in any case refused the engagements proposed to us, or contract others without the permission not knowledge of the capain, it is agreed for those who have not yet paid for their passage, for those who still owe part, and for those who cannot find an engagement, that they must consent to me, the captain, carrying them to such place in America as it shall please me, and wherever I may find it expedient to proceed, or wherever it may suit me to sail. These horrible conditions were signed by 300 passengers. They had contracted with the Captain of a Dutch ship, which was to proceed first to Baltimore. She in the worst state when she sailed from Amsterdam, and in defiance of the clauses of the contract, by which the Captain had engaged to feed them properly during the voyage, he had not even embarked the necessary quanitity of provisions ; for, after 62 days navigation, the leaks had so gained upon the ship, that she was in danger of sinking, and famine had already made frightful ravages. It was at the end of that time, and in this deplo rable condition, that she was forced into Belem, near Lisbon. Long before her arrival on our coasts, the passengers had been reduced to the greatest misery, not more by the small quantity than by the bad quality of the provisions. The water was gone, and sea-water was their only drink. So much had they been wasted, that forty had already died of famine. Among the rest there were a great many sick, some of who have died since their arrival in Portugal. The situation of the vessel had at first given great alarm to our Council of Health, who, apprehensive of contagion, were for an instant fearful that it would be necessary to force her out to sea. That would have been a misery so much the more formidable, because the ship was not in a state to keep the sea, and all must infallibly have perished. Happily this was deemed unnecessary, and a quarantine was ordered. The Regency of Lisbon determined that provisions and other succours should be furnished at the expence of the State. All the Consuls were most active and benevolent in affording assistance. Such was the result of the expedition. Many others have, no doubt, answered as little the expectations of those who, seduced by deceitful promises have emigrated to America in search of happiness which they could not find, abandoning their country, their parents, and their friends. In July, a Hamburgh ship, with 106 Swiss passengers, was at Lisbon, in nearly the same distress with the Dutch ship. It is said here that there is a company in Holland which has numerous agents to seduce men to emigrate. It heaps them pell mell on board ships, and if they reach their destination, they are soon con vinced of the fallacy of all their hopes. It would be a desirable thing for papers, in countries where these emigrations are excited, to insert the article relative to the charter party, given above, in order that the simple and credulous may see what they have to undergo.  ID134 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1819 	01 	02 	persuade 	In answer to the remarks which appeared in our paper on Monday last, respecting emigration to America, and to the statements there given of the disadvantages which emigrants from this country might expect to meet with, we have received a very abusive letter from an anonymous correspondent, who appears very angry, and, like most other angry men, seems more anxious to give full vent to his wrath than to assign any good reason for it. His first cause of quarrel is, that we have stated the general want of cleanliness to be a prevailing defect in the back parts of the United States. For this we have the authority of almost every traveller who has visited those parts. The remarks of Birkbeck on this point are conclu-sive and striking: – ' In viewing the Americans (he observes) and ' sketching, in a rude manner, as I pass along, ' their striking characteristics, I have seen a de' formity so general, that I cannot help esteem' ing it national, though I know it admits of ve' ry many individual exceptions. I have written ' it, and then erased it, wishing to pass it by, ' but it wont do – it is the truth, and to the truth ' I must adhere. Cleanliness in houses, and too ' often in person, is neglected to a degree which ' is very revolting to an Englishman. ' America was bred in a cabin ; this is not a ' reproach – for the origin is most honourable ; ' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn ' logs for a framed building, and that again for ' a mansion of brick, some of her cabin habits ' have been unconsciously retained. Many have ' already been quitted, and one by one they will ' all be cleared away, as I am told they are now ' in the cities of the eastern states. ' There are, I believe, court-houses, which ' are also made us of as places of worship, in ' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating ' ever since they were built. What reverence ' can be felt for the majesty of religion, or of ' the laws, in such styles of abomination ? The ' people who are content to assemble in them ' can scarcely respect each other. Here is a bad ' public example. It is said that to clean those ' places is the office of no one. But why is no ' person appointed ? Might it not be inferred ' that a disregard to the decencies of life prevails ' through such a community?' To the same purpose Cobbett complains of the ' general (for there are many exceptions) sloven' liness about the homsteads, and particularly ' about the dwellings of labourers. Mr Birkbeck ' complains of this, and indeed what a contrast ' with the homesteads and cottages which he left ' behind him, near the exemplary spot, Guild' ford, in Surrey.' He then proceeds to give the reasons for this. When the first settlers took possession of the country, the ' example of neat' ness (he observes) was wanting. There were ' no gentlemn's gardens, kept as clean as ' drawing-rooms, with grass as even as a car' pet. From endeavouring to imitate perfec' tion men arrive at mediocrity ; and those who ' never have seen or heard of perfection in these ' matters, will naturally be slovens.' He afterwards remarks – ' The market day at Guildford is a perfect ' show of cleanliness. Not even a carter without ' even a clean smock-frock, and closely shaven ' and clean washed face. Well may Mr Birkbeck, ' who came from this very spot, think the people ' dirty in the western country. I'll engage he ' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one ' family of his present neighbours, than he left ' behind upon the skins of all the people in ' the three parishes of Guildford. However, he ' would not have found this to be the case in ' Pennsylvania, and especially in those parts where ' the Quakers abound ; and, I am told, that in ' the New England States, the people are as ' cleanly and as neat as they are in England. ' The sweetest flowers, when they become pu' trid, stink the most, and a nasty woman is the ' nastiest thing in nature.' In answer to all this, our correspondent tells us, that the Scotch are very dirty. This, we admit, was formerly, and may still continue in some degree to be, the reproach of the Scotch. But does this reasonable person mean to argue from this, that dirty habits are amiable, and ought not to be corrected. With regard to the difficulties of effecting a settlement, we are borne out in our remarks on this subject by the authority of various writers, and principally by the autheor of the Emigrant's Guide, a work of great merit, which combines an extent and precision of statistical information altogether unequally, with the most enlarged general views of the state of the country, both physical and moral. ' Most men (observes ' this judicious writer) on arriving in the United ' States, expects too much. Perhaps the only ' essential advantages offered are the security of ' person and property, and the cheapness of land. ' It demands excessive labour, severe economy, ' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident, to ' succeed in a newly settled country ; and it de' mands the permanency of this continued la' bour, prudence, and favourable circumstances.' Our anonymous correspondent is also extremely displeased that we have stated so strongly the perincious effects produced on the general manners of the Americans by the existence of slavery ; and he mentions that many a labourer in this country might envy the condition of an American slave. What are those privileges for which a free man should envy a slave he does not think proper to state. To show, however, that we have not exaggerated the degradation and oppression of the coloured class in the United States, we shall again adduce the authority of the Emigrant's Guide. The author is contradicting the notion that the labourer in the slave States is confounded with the negroe ; and he expresses himself in the following terms: – ' A residence of 16 years in places where sla' very is prevalent, enables us to contradict a ' general expression, that, in such places, whites, ' performing manual labour, are confounded in ' the moral estimates of the people with slaves. ' Though less respect is certainly paid to useful ' labour in the slave states than where all the ' duties are performed by whites, yet ' the distance between the two races of men are ' in all cases immense. So deep, profound, and ' inveterate is the feeling on that subject, that ' not any where in the United States can pro' perty, sobriety, intelligence, and every other ' advantage, expect colour, raise in public opi' nion a man the most remotely allied to the ' African, to a rank equal to the meanest white. ' Any person who resides a few years in Louisi' ana will be witness to some very remarkable ' exemplifications of this innate contempt for all ' those who affinity involve them in the con' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery.' What a picture is here conveyed of misery and degradation on the one hand, and of tyranny on the other. – Here we find it failry confessed that no degree of worth, whether moral or intel lectual, not even the possession of property, can give a man the least degree of consideration in the eyes of the privileged class. We cannot conceive a community more wretchedly constituted. All that is estimable and worthy is here utterly contemned, because the individual who possesses these qualities happens to have his skin of a particular colour, and thus a merely accidental quality of the corporeal frame entails upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy and contempt. These distinctions, carried to such an excess, seem to us to be founded on the extinction of every generous and honourable sentiment, and we cannot help still asserting that we had rather live we at present are, than in a community where such hateful antipathies rule to the exclusion of every just and humane feeling. With regard to the condition of the negroe slaves we shall quote a passage from Brown's Western Gazetteer or Emigrant's Directory after reading which, we shall leave our anonymous correspondent to say whether he thinks the condition of a labourer in this country preferable to that of being an African slave. The writer, describing the town of Lexington, in Kentucky, observes – ' In this square stands the market-house, ' which is of brick, and well furnished on Wed' nesdays and Saturdays ; but occasionally the ' scene of a barbarous practise ; for it is here ' that incorrigible or delinquent negroes are ' flogged unmercifully. I saw this punishment ' inflicted on two of these wretches. Their ' screams soon collected a numerous crowd ; I ' could not help saying to myself, These cries ' are the knell of Kentucky libery.' Having made this answer to the angry charges thus brought against us, we have only to disclaim, in the strongest terms, all hostility or prejudice against the Americans. We have no wish either to depreciate their character or institutions. They exhibit the interesting spectacle of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace to wealth and greatness. To revile such a people would be the height of human folly, and equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to take offence because endeavour to make a fair estimate of their character, without hiding any of its defects.  ID368 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1794 	07 	25 	advertise 	LANDS in AMERICA for SALE. THESE two adjoining TRACKS of LAND in the County of FAYETTE and State of KENTUCKY. The one track consists of 7000 acres, and is divided into 15 plantations of 500 acres each; eight of these plantations, are still unsold, and are now offered at the low price of 137l. being only 5s. 6d. per acre. The other track counsists of 3086 acres, and is to be sold in one lot, at 5s. 6d. per acre. There is a fine stream of water running through these two tracks of land, which communicates with the great river Ohio, so that Mills may be erect. In Fayette County is Lexington, where the Courts of the State of Kentucky are held, and where all public business is transacted Lexington is in the neighbourhood of these lands, and Fayette county is the nearest and most convenient for Philadelphia, Baltimore, City of Washington, &c. The soil of Kentucky is deep and black, and lies upon a bed of lime-stone and coal. THe natural grown of the country are large walnuts, honey, poplar and sugar trees. The surface is covered with blue grass, clover, and wild rye, grape vines running to the tops of the trees. Shrubs and plants grow spontaneously, and afford a beautiful blossom of a rich and exquisite fragrance. Cotton and sugar are manufactured to advantage. wheat ,barley, oats, flax, and hemp, yield abundantly; indeed, it is assumed that there have been raised 100 bushels upon one acre, but the common produce is from 40 to 60 bushels an acre. Owing to the peculiar richness of the soil, and fine climate of the country, no part of America has been to repidly settled. The returns made to Congress, upon 1st May 1792 state them at 76 000. In March 1793, there were upwards of 100,000. And, from their astonishing increase since, they may be estimated at 200,000. Eleven years ago, Kentucky lay in a forest, but now she exhibits an extensive settlement, divided into seven populous counties, in which are a great number of flourishing towns, and contains more inhabitants than are in Georgia, Delaware, and Rhode Island States. There are about 70 churches in Kentucky and mostly PResbyterians. There is a College; and Schools are established in every town. There is a Printing-office; a Weekly Gazette published. There are Paper Mills, O??? Mills,???ing Mills, Saw Mills, and a great number of Grist Mills. Considerable quantities of Sugar, are made from the Sugar Trees. Salt-works are in every part of the country, and the inhabitants are supplied at a low price. The taxes upon land are very low. Any person who goes from Europe becomes an American Citizen on his arrival in this new State, and is entitled to be elected to any office in the Commonwealth. For farther particulars apply to MR. John Granger, writer to the signet; David Niven, writer, Glasgow; or to Mr. John Finlayson, writer, Cupar Fife;
