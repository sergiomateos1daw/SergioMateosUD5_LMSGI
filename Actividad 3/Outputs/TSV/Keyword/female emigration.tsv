What a disgrace to our young men at home !  ID65 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	07 	12 	entertain 	By the last letters from India, we understand they were going on in the plodding way, with nothing new or important.–The markets are overstocked with British goods, so as to enable our countrymen to supply themselves with most articles at a cheaper rate than if they were at home ; the credit of the revenue rather upon the increase ; Lord Cornwallis is as strict as ever, who is expected to remain another year among them, to the no small regret of those who left England for the sake of Oriental wealth. Our female adventurers have also found it a bad market ; British beauty never fails of finding its admirers ; but the late restriction in the East have rendered wives forbidden fruit, of which neither civil nor military dare to think of tasting.  ID70 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	09 	17 	entertain 	A humorous Adventure of a Marriage negotiated by a Bill of Exchange, in one of the English West India Islands. A Merchant, originally from London, having acquired a great fortune in this island, concluded with himself he could not be happy in the enjoyment of it, unless[?] he shared[?] it with a woman of merit ; and knowing none to his fancy he resolved to write to a worthy correspondent of his in London. He know no other [?] than that he used in his trade ; therefore treating affairs of love as he did his business, after giving his friend in a letter several comissions, and reserving this for the last, he went on thus : Item[?], seeing that I have taken a resolution to marry, and that I do not find a suitable match for me here, do not fail to send me by next ship bound hither, a young woman of the qualifications and form following: As for a portion I demand none ; let her be of an honest family ; between 20 and 25 years of age ; of a middle stature, and well proportioned ; her face agreeable, her temper mild, her character blameless, her heatlh good, and her constitution strong enough to bear the change of the climate, that there may be no occasion to look out for a second through lack of the [?] soon after she comes to hand ; which must be provided against as much as possible, considering the great distance and dangers of the sea. If she arrives, and conditioned as abovesaid, with the present letter endorsed by you, or, at least, an attested copy thereof, that there may be no mistake or imposition, I hereby oblige and engage myself satisfy the said letter, by marrying the [?] at 15 days [?]. In witness [?] [?] I [?] [?], [?]. The London correspondent read over and over the odd article, which put the future [?] on the same footing with the bales of good he was to send to his friend ; and after adressing[?] the prudent exactness of the naturalized Creole, and his laconic stile, in enumerating the qualifications he insisted on, he endeavoured to serve him to his mind ; and after many enquiries, he judged he had found a lady fit for his purpose, in a young person of a reputable family, but no fortune ; of good humour, and of a polite education ; well shaped, and more than tolerably handsome. He made the proposal to her as his friend has directed, and the young gentlewoman, who had no subsistence but from a cross old aunt, who gave her a great deal of uneasiness, accepted it. A ship bound for the West Indies was then fitting out at Bristol ; the gentlewoman went on board the same, together with the bales of goods, being well provided with all necessaries, and particularly with a certificate in due form, and indorsed by the correspondent. She was also included in the invoice, the last article of which ran thus : Item, a maid of 21 years of age, of the quality, shape and conditioned as per order ; as appears by the affadavits and certificates she has to produce. Writings, which were thought necessary to so exact a man as the future husband, were an extract from the parish register ; a certificate of her character, signified by the curate ; an attestation of her neighbours, setting forth that she had for the space of three years lived with an old aunt who was intolerably peevish, and that she had not, during all that time, given her said aunt, the least occasion of complaint. And li[?]y, the goodness of her consitution was certified after [?] by [?] [?]. [?] [?] departure the London correspondent sent several letters of advice by other ships to his friend, whereby he informed him that per such a [?] he sent him a young woman of such an age, character, and condition &c. in a word, such [?] desired to marry. The letters of advice, the bales, and the gentlewoman came safe to the port ; and our Creole, who happened to be one[?] of the foremost on the pier and the lady's landing was charmed to see a handsome person, who having heard him called by his name, told him, Sir, I have a bill of exchange upon you, and you know that it is not usually for people to carry a great deal of money about them in such a long voyage as I have made ; I beg the favour you will pleased to pay it. At the same time she gave him his correspondent's letter, on the back of which was wrote, The bearer of this is the spouse you ordered me to send you. Ha, [?][?] ! said the Creole, I never yet suffered my bills to be protested, and I swear this shall not be the first : I shall reckon myself the most fortunate of all men, if you allow me to discharge it. Yes, Sir, replied she, and the more willingly, since I am apprized of your character. We have several persons of honour on board, who knew you very well, and who, during my passage have answered all the questions I asked them concerning you, in so advantageous a manner, that it has raised in me [?] for you. This first interview was in a few days after followed by the nuptials, which were very magnificent. The new married couple are satisfied with their happy union made by [?] of exchange, which was the most fortunate that had happened in that island for many years.  ID84 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	11 	08 	entertain 	The Indian ships lately returned from Madras and Bengal, gives unfavourable accounts of all the branches of commerce, except that of matrimony, which has succeeded wonderfully in the last female exportations. Out of eleven ladies, who embarked on a marriage venture on board the Chesterfield, Captain Burgess, nine were connubially linked to weakly husbands within three months after their arrival and the other two were left in a way to complete this fortunate band of hymeneal adventu- rers.  ID100 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1794 	02 	14 	inform 	At four o'clock yesterday morning Mess. Muir, Skirving, and Margarot, were taken from their beds, without any previous notice, hand-cuffed, and put into a post-chaise, to be conveyed to Woolwich, where a vessel waits to sail with them immediately for Botany Bay. Mr. Palmer has, we understood, been sent from on board the hulks, in the same manner, to take his passage on board the same vessel. Between 10 and 11 o'clock, about sixty female convicts were put on board a vessel at Blackfriars bridge, destined to the same voyage. These latter behaved in a most turbulent manner and even fought in the hold of the boat. There were among them one or two well dressed women ; and what was more lamentable in the eyes of the spectator, some of had infants with them.  ID236 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1833 	02 	02 	inform 	Emigration. –The governors of the Refuge for the Destitute, in the Hackney Road, have announced that it is their intention to send out a ship to New South Wales in the ensuing spring with 500 unmarried women or widows between the age of 18 and 30 years, as emigrants to New South Wales. It is intended to place the emigrants in divers situations, and leave them free and not bound to an employer.  ID250 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1835 	08 	05 	inform 	Free Emigration of Females T he Emigration Committee (acting under the authority of the Secretary of State for the Colonies), HEREBY GIVES NOTICE, That the BOADICEA, a fine new ship of 500 Tons, fitted expressly for the conveyance of Females, will sail from GRAVESEND on T hursday the 1st day of O ctober for HOBART TOWN. Single Females, of good character, between 15 and 30 years of age, will be admitted to a Free Passage, by making application, accompanied with certificates, to Lieut. F orrest, R.N., his Majesty's Agent for Emigration, Custom-house, Leith, from whom particulars may be obtained. A limited number of MARRIED AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS and MECHANICS, and their Failies, will be sent by this Vessel on liberal terms ; but none need apply without certificates of moral character.  ID259 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1836 	07 	16 	inform 	Every thing is jobbed Female Emigration to Australia, &c. (From a Correspondent.) Our penal settlements appear to be very indifferently managed; and we are glad to find that such a man as Sir John Franklin is appointed to govern Van Diemen's Land; and the sooner an improved system is adopted for New South Wales, the better. Not only are men sent out to govern who are ignorant of human nature, a knowledge of which is essential to the management of the heterogenous materials of our penal colonies; but when the Government at home opens its eyes to any proposal for improvement,it is mismanaged. Our rulers have the sense to see the importance of sending our respectable females to these colonies ; but they trust an Emigration Committee, and this committee trusts individuals who desire to make the most of the concern ; and we are glad to have an opportunity of making the public acquainted with the mode in which the business is conducted, in the hope that some humane Member of Parliament will take the subject up. The mode of managing female emigration is this :– A temptation, in the first place, is held out of a free passage to Australia. A ship is hired, and this ship must ave a full cargo, to satisfy the owners. Advertisements are issued, and instead of hard working females, a parcel of decayed governesses, dressmakers, &c. &c., with a small mixture of better articles, is made up. But if, as almost always happens, a sufficient number of these to fill the ship does not come forward, a supply of sweepings is taken from a workhouse! Here, then, is such a mixture of good, bad, and indifferent, to the amount of two hundred and upwards, that there is enough of evil to corrupt the good. As to the comfort of the poor creatures they are crammed four into one bed ! Such is the power of jobbing, that we happen to know the fact, that some young women of respectability who wished to go to New South Wales with their friends, were refused a free passage, unless they went to London to go in the Government ship ! Thus we see that the interests of agents and shipowners overcomes the interests of the colonies, and actually obstructs the attainment of the object in view. We find blindness a very common ailment in every department of Government ; and however desirous our rulrs may be to reform every abuse, and to adopt useful measures, they are often thwarted by the necessity (which ought not to exist) of conciliating harpies and leeches, which devour the public substance, and suck the public blood. Reform has, as yet, only begun to clean the outside of the platter ; and it may not reach the inside in our day. It is the duty, however, of all patriots, to sharpen the knife that is to cut out corruption from the heart of the commonwealth, by means of exposure of every abuse that comes to be known, and to support those who are willing to apply it. As in a matter of so much importance nothing should be concealed, there is no hesitation in stating that it consists with our knowledge that, after the Emigration Committee in Van Diemen's Land, detailing the deplorable consequences of sending out young women from workhouses, a ship has actually sailed, nearly filled up as we have described. When any representation is made to a public office, the matter is said to belong to another department ; and that other department says it is not its province to interfere ; and thus humanity is made the shuttlecock to the battledore of jobbing and the blindness of office. If our brethren of the press will take up this, the inhuman job will be put an end to.
