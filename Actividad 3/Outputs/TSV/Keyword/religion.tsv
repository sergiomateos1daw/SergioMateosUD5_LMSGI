He has settled at Port Jackson, and has leave to teach the children of some of your nation to read and write in your own way. The place is much improved since you ahve had any letters form it, as there was no person without a habitation, and being in some order, when he left it. Except wearing apparel, very little is wanting but business ; but you may thank the Dutch at Batavia for it, as they have brought several useful things there. The last crops of corn, and the garden grounds, were in very good condition : and what makes the settlement more convenient, one of the people who came in the first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for use and ornament, as the clay is equally good as that of Delft or elsewhere. He was surprised to see so many people without hats or shoes, and houses without windows, and full of wicker and rush furniture, which is used in the place of almost every thing else. If the smiths had a plentiful supply of coal and iron, hardly any utensils would be wanting. Your nephew has two children, and says all that are born there are very healthy, and more born than are buried or executed of grown people. The Christians Church was quite finished before he came away ; and he thinks if there were enough of your people, they might have a place to themselves. The farthest of the lines was seldom visited by the savages ; and it was reported when he came away, that as soon as more troops and a new Governor comes over, they would go farther than ever up the country, when some valuable discovers are expected to be made ; they have a gum which may be used for gum arabic, which is veyr useful. He expects several of your people will go from Batavia to settle there very soon ; and wonders a way for sending old clothes is not yet found out. Norfolk Island is os thinly inhabited, that it is not worth a stranger's while to land there ; and as little is said about it there, as if it was as far off as Europe, &c. &c.  ID42 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	12 	14 	inform 	Account of a singular Sect called Shaking QuakERS in America. I N the United States of America there are some Jews, and various denomications of Christians, –as Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers, Dunkers, Moravians, Deists, Methodists, Newlights, Sandimanians, Universalists, and Shaking Quakers; all of whom are allowed to perform religious worship accoridng to the dictates of their consciences. The Shaking Quakers are a new sects, that sprang up about the year 1769 : an old woman called the Elect Lady, with twelve disciples, all of which were said to be Europeans, were the founders of this new mode of worship ; they drew thousands of people after them, who pretended they were visited with power from on high to work miracles, heal the sick, raise the dead, cast out devils, and speak in unknown languages. This Lady risided in the north-westerly part of the State of New York, where she began to instil her tenets into some of the people there:– afterwards she rambled from place to place, promulgating her religion, and gaining proselytes in New England, and elsewhere:–she engrossed the kingdom of heaven to herself and followers, to the seculsion of all others. She pretended her mission was immediately from heaven;–that she travelled in pain for her elect, –could speak in seventry-two unknown languages, in which she conversed with those that had departed this life,–that there had not been a true church upon earth since the days of the Apostles, until her's was erected,–that both the living and the dead must be saved, in, by, and through her –must confess their sins unto her, and procure her parson, or they could not be saved;–that that she gathered her church from both earth and hell, as every person that had died since the time of the Apostles, until her church was set up, was damned, and that they were ocntinually making intercession to her for salvation, which was the occasion of her talking to them in those unknown tongues. Those that entered into her church were obliged to confess their sins, and deliver up their jewels, rings, necklaces, buckles, watches, &c. to be disposed of as she thought fit. It has been reported that some of these confessions proved very beneficial; for some of her church members owned they had stolen things that had been laid to innocent persons. When these people carry on their worship, they pretend to praise the Lord by singing, dancing, jumping, turning round, falling down, tumbling, &c. and in the mean time some will be trembling, groaning, sighing, and sobbing: whilst others are preaching, praying, exhorting, &c. others will be clapping their hands, shouting, hallowing, screaming, and making such a hideous noise, that it may be heard at a great distance, and will often affrighten the spectators. They often dance three hours without intermission, and when any of them are tired of praising the Lord that way, they are whipped by others, to make the worship go on briskly. They dance till they are much emaciated ; the young women grow pale, appear like ghosts or apparitions, or like deserters from a church-yard, –if I may use the sailor's phrase. They make no use of the Eucharist, or of water baptism in their churchs; are averse to wars, fighting, and swearing ; they use the plain language, and cry– yea, and nay, instead of yes and no : but the other Quakers do not approve of all their tenets. At particular times they labour very hard at their respective occupations, and are very careful that no time is spent in idleness. They pretend they hold a correspondence with the saints and angels, and that they frequently see and converse with the spirits of their departed friends. Many of them refuse to be with their wives, because they suppose they are part of the hundred and forty and four thousand mentioned in the Revelations that were redeemed from the earth, and were not defiled with women. They hold, that they have already been made partakers of the first resurrection, and that on them the second death will have no power. They do not allows the instrumental music in their churches, because they suppose it was ceremonial, and is abolished;–but pretend that they carry on their worship by the immediate power and influence of the Holy Ghost, and that they have scripture warrents for their practice, a[?]– Sing unto God,–Praise the Lord in the dance; –O clap your hands, all ye people;–Shout on to God;–Make a joyful noise;–Fall down before the Lords,&c.  ID48 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	12 	18 	persuade 	The Minister is now said to be employed in drawing up two plans, which will give rise to very warm debates in Parliament : one is for settling a commercial arrangement between Great Britain and Ireland ; the other for giving a constitution to Canada. In feeling the former, the Minister will have to contend with strong commercial prejudices; in the latter, he will have to encounter religious principles. The British settlers in Canada are comparatively few in number. The great bulk of the Canadians are the descendants of French, and are Roman Catholics. The former are Protestants. Fleaury in france, and Walpole in England, were not fonder of peace than Mr. Pitt. Conquests may be made by war, but consequence and wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system, if the first commercial nation in the world. Besides these considerations, the grand secret has been discovered since the present Minister came into power, that the best riddance England ever had, was of her American Colonies ; because by this means, she becomes thoroughly collected at home, to oppose every foreign power, without the expence and blood of supporting the Americans, at the same time that they cannot do without BRitish manufactures in one line or another. Thus, they are under the necessity of protecting themselves, at the same time, that, like the rest of Europe, they are obliged to resort to our superior mercantile market. Application has been lately made to the Lords of the Treasury for an order on the Bank to issue some of the new silver coin, in aid of the present want of silver for circulation, the scarcity of which is much felt by retail traders in particular.  ID73 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	11 	19 	entertain 	Court of Chancery. The King, at the relation of the Bishop of London , versus Anderson and Gipps. On the 18th of June, 1692, the Hon. Mr. Boyle left by will the sum of 5400l. to be laid out in lands in Yorkshire, out of the rents of which the sum of 90l. was to be paid annually to the College of William and Mary, in New England, to be applied for the purpose of propagating the Christian religion amongst the Indians in the back settlements in North America ; and likewise a further sum of 45l. to be paid to the same College, for the support of two missionaries to preach the gospel. The city of London were left trustees, and the management under the trust was, by the will, committed to the care of the Bishop of London. The present Bishop instituted this suit, in which the city, and a great number of other persons, were parties, for the single, and indeed novel purpose of knowing, whether (as the teststor had originally devised the several sums for the use of British subjects, and the Americans having ceased to be in that situations since their independence), the annuity ought not to revert to this kingdom, or to some other of his Majesty's colonies, to be applied to similar purposes. This being the first determination of that nature since the American Revolution, the Lord Chancellor decided it with that superior dignity of sentiment that always attends his decrees. Two phrases are sufficient– all charitable devices are to be held sacred– we cannot rake up the ashes of the dead, in search of latent intentions. The annuities and arrears must be paid, and Messrs. Anderson and Gipps, and likewise the city of London, must be paid their costs.  ID101 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1794 	02 	07 	inform 	The Quakers of America have addressed an humble Representation to the Legislative Body of that country, praying that exhibitions, Preludes, Interludes, yea, all lewds and stage-plays may be discountenanced, pointing out their pernicious tendency in corrupting the morals of the People.  ID141 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1819 	05 	27 	inform 	Extract of a letter from William Hunt, esq. To H. Hunt, esq. Washington Hotel, New Orleans, Dec. 25. 1818. My Dear Brother – We arrived safe in the mouth of the Mississippi on the 10th of this month, after a voyage of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in excellent health, and very happy. There are 35 English vessels from Liverpool now here, and a great many English emigrants from Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Lancashire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Somersetshire ; and, in fact, from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a week in the river, about 80 miles below New Orleans ; we all went on shore, and had plenty of rabbit shooting. I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun, by Knock, corner of Fetter-lane. Henry, myself, and Mr Blake went one day into the woods to kill deer, by night coming on, we lost our road ; and, differing in opinions, we separated, Henry and Mr Blake taking one road, and myself the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods, and did not return to us till the next morning. It being wet, and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground, in spite of the remonstrances of Mr Blake, caught a severe cold, and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days, but he is now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In the river there are thousands of wild swans, wild geese, wild ducks, woodcocks, snipes, and other wild fowl. If you were there, you would kill a waggon load in a day, as I know you have frequently killed a horse load in England ; but they are a thousand times more numerous here than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms with them, and very cheap. No game certificate required here. Myself, Henry, Mr Blake, and the other passengers, visited a French farmer, about six miles below New Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land, whereon are sugar plantations, sugar-houses, & c. ; he made 250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter, as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. – They are very lazy, bad managers, and appear to use their negroes very cruel, and work them very hard. The Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer, as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the deaths are frequently seventy in a week. The scenery of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and Staines, and many of the buildings are as handsome as those of Bath. Here is one Church, which is a very beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spanish shops are all open, and it is a market during the whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening, gambling & c. We are at the Washington Hotel, the best in the city ; it is expensive, although very good living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each, including claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm weather as in England, and it is as warm here now as it was in England in July, although not half so oppressive and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the election : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel, most of them English. We do not trouble ourselves about politics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil, and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday we were charged 100 dollars each for passage, and four dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four quarters of the best peas, rye, grass seed, and some more of Hill's Scots ploughs, to be left at Messrs Brown and Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the Illinois. Mr Trimmer, an Englishman, has purchased 20,000 acres of land near Mr Birkbeck, and has taken twenty couple of hounds with him, so that we shall have some hunting as well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought over some with me, but they may follow us ; as I understand the labourers, with the pay of a dollar a day, can live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply, and others that I have seen from Illinois, report that the farmer can get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is a good sure market, and a fair profit and only one penny per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to pay. Price of labour is very dear here ; we pay a dollar for washing every dozen of shirts, cravats, pocket handkerchiefs, & c. & c. The price of a gallon of best rum is one and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things shipped from England, I have paid 92 dollars for. Although I should like England very well if it was not for the taxes, yet, from what I have seen hitherto, I like America ten times better  ID220 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1831 	06 	04 	inform 	The brig Stirling Castle, Captain Fraser, sailed from Greenock on Wednesday morning, for Sidney, New South Wales, having on board the Rev. J. D. Lang, minister of the Scots Church, in Sydney, and two other Presbyterian Ministers ordained to new stations in that colony ; also three Professors, intended for which a liberal Government grant has been obtained. There are also on board above 40 respectable mechanics with their families, consisting chiefly of joiners, masons, and others required for the building of the College, and a good many of whom are fromthis town, making the number of passengers in all about 140, of whom above 20 and cabin passengers.  ID257 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1836 	04 	09 	inform 	Sir George Clerk. –As the cawing of the rooks portends a storm, it is worth while to mention that the cunning baronet has come down from London, and commenced a canvass in this county within these few days. It is stated, we believe upon good authority, that he accounts for this course of proceeding, by referring to the great probability of the Lords throwing out the Irish Municipal Bill. Burn's Monument. –We understand that there is now an early prospect of the completion of this monument, which has too long remained in an unfinished state, to the surprise of strangers, and the discredit to our Modern Athens. The sum already in the Treasurer's hands, aided by the profits of the handsome musical work lately issued by Mr M'Leod, which he has generously devoted to that purpose, is now nearly sufficient to meet the calculations of the expense requird for the railing in and decoration of the ground around the monument. We expect, therefore, that the work will forthwith be commenced, and if a few pounds are still wanted, we have no doubt there are hundreds in Edinburgh who would willingly guarantee the Treasurer against any loss by the immediate completion of the undertaking. Annuity Tax. –We understand that deputations from several places in the country, are expected to attend the public meeting which is to be held on Tuesday evening, for the purpose of petitioning Parliament for the abolition of the Annuity Tax, in order to testify their abhorrence of that system of politico Christianity which requires distraint and imprisonment for its support. We observe that Mr Gillon, of Wallhouse, M.P. is to take the chair. The meeting we doubt not, will be most numerously attended. Law of Scotland. –The prizes given by Professor Bell, for the greatest proficiency in the examinations, were yesterday awarded to Mr William Neish, 25, India Street, in the senior, and to William Spence, 31, Broughton Place, in the junior class. The following gentlemen also distinguished themselves in the competition : Mr John Fraser, James Gilchrist, James Mason, James Scott, in the senior class; James Oliver, David Gale, John R. Banks, James Charles Murray, Wm. M'Naughton, in the junior. Kilwinning, March 30.–The United Associate Presbytery of Kilmarnock met at Kilwinning on Tuesday, the 22d March, and ordained Mr A. Macgregor to the pastoral charge of the congregation in that place. The Rev. D. Henderson, of Dalry, preached and presided. The Rev. Mr Cairns, of Stewarton, ordained, and the Rev D. Ronald, of Saltcoats, gave the charge to the minister and congregation. On the Sabbath following, the Rev. Mr Tait, of Barrhead, introduced Mr Macgregor to his congregation ; and there is every prospect that the hitherto long disappointed congregation of Kilwinning will now prosper under the pastoral care of their much esteemed and highly talented young minister. Presentation of Plate. –Mr A. S. Walker, late of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, at present manager of the branch of the Commercial Bank of England, at Uttoxeter, in Staffordshire, was lately presented with an elegant tea service by the proprietors of that establishment, bearing the following inscription :– Presented to Mr Archibald S. Walker, by the Uttoxeter Proprietors of the Commercial Bank of England, as a small acknowledgement of his faithful and valuable services–March, 1836. This is another proof of the estimation in which many of the young men are held who have been trained to the banking system in this country. From a Return, just published, we find that the emigration to Canada has been comparatively small last year. The whole number of emigrants landed at Quebec and Montreal in 1835, was 12,527 : in 1831 and 1832 four times, and in 1834 two times as many were sent out. Of the 12,527, there were 5597 adult males, 3866 females, and 3064 children under 14 years. Of the whole number, 1043 were sent out by parochial aid. The numbers from the three kingdoms were– England, 3067 Ireland, 7,108 Scotland, 2,127 From Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, &c. 225 Settled in Lower Canada, 2,297 Upper Canada, 9,800 Died at Grosse Isle and Quebec, 13 Returned to the United Kingdom, 117 Removed to the United States, 300 –12,527 But besides those who went to Canada, 16,749 landed at New York, raising the whole number of emigrants to 29,376. There were no less than three vessels wrecked last year on their way to Quebec– the William Ewing from Londonderry with 300 passengers, all saved–the barque James from Newfoundland, all saved–and the Nathaniel Graham from Cork, with 48 persons on board, passengers and crew, of whom 41 were lost. From another part of the Report, we find that 2764 female emigrants were sent out to Australia last year, under the superintendence of the Emigration Committee. Of these 2105 had a free passage. The arrangements seem to have been ood ; for the mortality was small, and few complaints were made. The females were all of decent character, and due care was taken on their arrival to get them disposed of as servants, in situations where their morals would not be exposed to unnecessary risk. Ulster Railway. –Length 36 miles, from Belfast to Armagh ; capital t600,000, in 12,000 shares, of which t393,000 are subscribed. The number of passengers expected is 450,000; the expected income is t93,000, of which t67,800 is from passengers ; the estimated expense of the work is t539,000. The steepest gradient is 1 in 200. There are 3 tunnels of 310, 320, and 570 yards in length. East Lothian Railway. –We call attention with great pleasure to the Prospectus of a railway from Dunbar to Edinburgh, by Haddington and Tranent, which appears in our first page. No one can have travelled over the ground without observing how admirably it is fitted for this species of communication, by its remarkable uniformity of surface. We should have doubted whether such a work would pay, had it terminated at Edinburgh ; but as a part of an unbroken line reaching across the most fertile and populous parts of Scotland, from the German ocean to the Atlantic, its chances of success are vastly increased. Dundee and Arbroath Railway. –The Committee's report on this railway has reached us, but we must confine ourselves to an abstract. The length is 16 miles 5 furlongs and 90 yards ; the capital t100,000, divided into 4000 shares, which is all subscribed, but authority is taken to raise t40,000 more by loan ; sum paid up t5000 ; subscribed by shareholders locally interested t88,900, by others t7150 : there are three subscribers for t2000 and upwards : the expected income from passengers is t16,912, goods t14,654, from both t31,566. There are no tunnels, no inclined planes, and the steepest gradient being only 1 in 1000, scarcely differs from a dead level. It does not cross any highway or turnpike on a level. The estimated expenses is t99,844. Statute Labour Acts. –It appears from the votes of the House of Commons, that a Select Committee has been appointed to investigate the Scottish Statute Labour Acts, and to consider what amendments may be made thereon. It may be stated, that by the present act for this county, proprietors of land, and several other descriptions of people are totally exempted from any burden, on account of the coaches, chaises, gigs, or saddle horses they may keep, though it is quite plain good roads are of as much advantage to them as to the occupiers of land, upon whom almost the sole burden is thrown. In many parishes a considerable addition would be made to the road funds, were no such exemptions allowed. At present the management is vested in heritors, rated at one hundred pounds Scots and upwards, though it is stated with confidence, that were the occupiers of land included, beneficial consequences would follow.– East- Lothian Correspondent. Leith Mechanics' Friendly Assurance Society. – The fifth annual meeting of this Institution was held on Tuesday last–John Hutton, Esq., one of the Honorary Members, President of the Society, in the chair. A very satisfactory report for the last year was read, and thanks were voted to the different Office bearers. It appears that this society was established under the countenance of the Magistrates and Ministers, and various influential individuals in Leith, and is well deserving of encouragement, as affording the benefits of mutual insurance to the working classes, the lowest rates consistent with perfect security. The funds, we understand, are in a prosperous state. Hay and Straw. –In consequence of it having been alleged last Wednesday, that higher prices were got for straw than those quoted, we have made due inquiry, and find there are no grounds for such an allegation. We have been further assured, that in reporting the prices of hay and straw for these two years past, the clerk of the corn market has never shown a desire to favour the farm servants at the expense of their employers, or to favour either party at the expense of the public. The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have been pleased to grant by their warrant, dated the 6th of April 1836, a distinguishing flag to be worn by the respective vessels belonging to the Eastern Regatta Club of Scotland, viz. a blue cornet flag, with a white St Andrew's cross on the upper quarter on a red field. Heriot's Hospital. –At the meeting of the Governors of George Heriot's Hospital, on Thursday the 7th instant, the estimate of Messrs Trotter for alterations and repairs on the chapel, amounting to t935, was accepted, and it will gratify the friends of economy to learn, that this is t65 under the sum voted by a majority of the Governors for that purpose some time ago. Thereafter a unanimous vote of thanks was passed to Councillor Gillespie Graham, for gratuitously furnishing a plan of the intended improvements on the chapel, which was described by Councillor Grant and others, as highly creditable to the skill and good taste of that distinguished architect. The Governors then proceeded to consider the list of applications for admission of boys, preparatory to the usual half-yearly election. There were 16 vacancies and 37 applicants, who may be thus classed :– Those who have never received benefit from George Heriot's Hospital, or any other institution, 12 Those who have received benefit for one child, 13 Do. for two children, 6 Do. for three children, 5 Do. for five children, 1 37 In considering cases the present practise of the Governors is to give preference, first to children of widows (being poor), then to those who have never received benefit, afterwards those who have had only one child in, and so on. These were but three applications for widow's children, and one for an orphan, out of the above number, and it is therefore probable, considering the large population of Edinburgh, that it is not sufficiently known, that George Heriot, in his will, expressly points out the fatherless and poor, being children of burgesses and freemen, as the objects of his charity–hence, if there be not a sufficient numbers of really necessitous cases, the Governors, in filling up the vacancies, may elect some that do not appear to have strong claims, simply from those that have such claims not coming forward in sufficient numbers. Political Economy. –On Thursday last the course of lectures on Political Economy, delivered by Dr Thomas Murray, in Elder Street Chapel, was brought to a conclusion ; on which occasion the thanks of the meeting were, on the motion of one of the members of committe, voted by acclamation to the lecturer for his valuable services. After thanks had been returned by Dr Murray, Mr A. G. Hunter, merchant, was called to the Chair, and some conversation having taken place, the committee of management, who had necessarily been self-elected, were confirmed by the meeting in their office, and empowered to take such steps as they might think expedient for obtaining lectures to the industrious classes next winter. We understand that Dr Murray is to be entertained at supper, some evening next week, on the occasion of being presented with a piece of silver plate. It is with much regret we learn that John Grieve, Esq. of Newington Cottage, died on Monday last. He was beloved and esteemed for his estimable qualities by all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance, and his death will be long and deeply regretted. Rare Sights in London. –A young Scottish Miss, who had voyaged the length of London on a pleasure jaunt, returned the other day by one of the steamers, and was met on landing by various members of her family, who anxiously inquired what she had seen in London. Seen ! exclaimed the fair tourist I have seen such sights ! I saw the Theological Garden, and all the wild beasts in't! The Theatre.–Mr C. Kean concluded his engagement on Thursday evening–an engagement the longest and most brilliant of any that our Theatre has witnessed for many years. Mr Kean has been with us for a whole month, and has succeeded in crowding the house almost every night. We understand that upwards of 30,000 persons have visited the theatre during his engagement–a number beyond that of any former period of equal duration. In that time he has appeared in some of the most arduous and difficult of Shakespeare's characters Hamlet, Richard, Macbeth, Othello, Shylock, and King John, investing each with its own peculiar charms and interest, and exciting the highest admiration and astonishment at the versatility and power of his genius, which could give such individuality and truth to so many dissimilar, distinct, and separate classes of characters. The play with which his engagement concluded was Richard, which character he has performed seven times during his engagement ; the house was, as usual, crowded in every part, and he exerted himself most strenuously and successfully. At the conclusion the cheers of the audience were loud and long, and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage from different parts of the house. Mr K. being loudly called for, appeared in front of the stage, and delivered the following very neat and appropriate address:– Ladies and Gentlemen, –I now stand before you for the last time this season, but believe me whichever way my pilgrimage may bend, my thoughts will ever recur to Edinburgh as those of a child to its distant home, fondly anticipating the hour when he shall again stand upon its threshold. (Great cheering.) Till that period permit me with a heavy, but a grateful heart, to pronounce that melancholy word– farewell. (Mr Kean then withdrew amidst reiterated and enthusiastic plaudits from all parts of the house.) –Mr K. we perceive, appears next in Aberdeen, where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his performances. The boxes there, we are told, are already taken for several successive nights to come.– Mrs Honey, from the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, makes her appearance here on Monday first. On Wednesday evening, Mr John G. Moxey, baker, Castle Street, was entertained at supper, in Menzie's Hotel and Tavern, Waterloo Place, by a party of friends, of about fifty in number, previous to his leaving this country for America, to which he is about to emigrate. The company was very harmonious, and the compliment must have been very gratifying to Mr Moxey. Qualifications of General Assembly Elders. –The Presbytery of Cupar, at their meeting on the 29th ult. elected the Earl of Leven and Melville, and Walter Malcolm, Esq. Edinburgh, to represent them in the ensuing Assembly. Mr Malcolm is factor for Captain Hay of Mugdrum, who is principal heritor in the parish of Newburgh, and was lately ordained an elder there. Against his election to serve in the Assembly a protest and appeal were taken, on the grounds, as we understand, that he has no domicile within the bounds of Presbytery, and is not an officiating elder; the protesters allowing that his election, though consistent with the letter, is contrary to the spirit of an act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal is sustained, it is evident that a large proportion of the Assembly elders must vacate their seats. Intimation also was given by D. Maitland M'Gill, Esq., that when the commissions came to be attested, he would move for evidence being produced that the elders-elect maintain family worship. An amusing inquiry was instituted in the Presbytery last year respecting the Earl of Leven's habits of domestic devotion ; and a clerical member had the candour to say, he should wish to know how it was with the ministers themselves in that respect. The University of St Andrews has just conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity on the Rev. Professor Paxton, of Edinburgh. In bestowing this public honour on one, who, during a long and useful life, has done so much for the cause of literature and religion, the members of the College have done an act which shows that they can appreciate real merit, and which will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious public of Scotland. Those who have had the good fortune to enjoy the public ministrations of Professor Paxton, and even the general church-going community, are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence, of the pious and heartfelt warmth, and of the classical elegance which have long characterised his public preaching. Even beyond the religious body of which he is the ornament, he is well known as one of the most popular and impressive teachers of the day. In his lectures on Theology, as Professor to the General Associate Synod, and afterwards to the Associate Synod, he displayed the results of an extensive and profound critical study of the Scriptures, and of an unwearied research into the Natural History, and the manners and usages of the ancients nations. The work by which he is chiefly known as an author– The Illustrations of Scripture –will long bear testimony to the extent of his learning, and of his Oriental investigations, and to his powers of lucid and eloquent composition. We understand that the attention of the College was directed to Mr Paxton's merits by the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages. This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the same field of study, reflects high honour on the discrimination and the heart of Mr Tennant. Public Dinner to Professor Dick. –On Tuesday last, the Students ofthe Edinburgh Veterinary College and a number of Veterinary Surgeons and other gentlemen (in all upwards of 70) from various parts of Scotland, entertained Professor Dick to a public dinner in the Waterloo Hotel. John Lambert, Esq. in the Chair, and Alexander Gordon, jun Esq. croupier. The stewards were Ed. Pyper, Esq. of West Craigs, J. R. Laing, Esq. jun of Dunkenny, Samuel Wordsworth, jun. Esq. W.S., Dr Malcolm, James Miller, Esq. and George Rennie, Esq.– Amongst the gentlemen present we observed Professors Low and Lizars ; Drs Robertson, Spittal, Knox, and Aitken, Mr Ferguson, surgeon ; J. B. Murdoch, Esq. of Coldoch; Charles Gordon, Esq. Secretary to the Highland Society of Scotland ; A. T. Blackwood, Esq. of Oggs Castle ; Mr Dick, senior &c. The cloth having been removed and the usual loyal toasts drank, the chairman, in a neat and appropriate speech, proposed the health of Professor Dick, to whom the present meeting had assembled to do honour, and who at once commanded their esteem as a member of society and their admiration as a man of talent, which toast was drank with the greatest enthusiasm. The chairman then proposed his Grace the Duke of Gordon and the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, Patrons of the Edinburgh Veterinary College, which was followed by a variety of other appropriate toasts. Many excellent songs were sung, and the conviviality of the evening was kept up until a late hour. Royal Infirmary –We understand that the Stewards of the late Fancy Ball for the benefit of the Royal Infirmary have, by their judicious arrangements in the management of the ball, been enabled to pay over to the trustees of that institution, (after deducting all expenses) the sum of t432, 7s. 8d. The managers of the Infirmary, as well as the public at large, are certainly much indebted to the gentlemen who acted as stewards upon that occasion, for their valuable extertions, particularly at the present time, in support of this great and useful institution, for the relief of those labouring under the united calamities of indigence and disease.  ID273 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1838 	09 	22 	inform 	The King of Prussia and his Catholic Sub- jects. –The German Courier in an article date Berlin, 5th instant, refers to the late arrests in Posen, and accuses the Catholic clergy of stimulating their flocks to revolt. The Prussian Government had, in consequence, increased its exertions to conciliate the Court of Rome, in hopes that its influence would be exercised over the clergy, and induce them to return to their allegiance. On the other hand, the sect of Separatists, who had resolved to emigrate from Austria to Australia, because of the interference of Government with their religious belief, amounted to 40,000 souls. It was said they would be joined by a great number of the inhabitants of Pomerania.  ID275 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1839 	04 	10 	inform 	The Wesleyan Mission Ship. –The Committee of this Society have purchased a vessel, to be employed exclusively under their direction in conveying missionaries and stores between the colonies of New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, the Friendly Islands, the Fejees, and other groups and islands of the Great South Pacific Ocean.  ID278 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1839 	06 	05 	inform 	Daryanthus Excelsa –This most magnificent and gigantic plant is now in full bloom in one of the hothouses at Dunkeld gardens. It is a native of New South Wales, and to be met with in this country in very few collections–this being the third plant of the kind that has flowered in Great Britain. It is one of the four plants which were sent from New Holland to the Duchess of Atholl, twelve years ago, and the only one that has survived the voyage. The seapus or stem is upwards of twelve feet in heigh, from the top of which diverge seven stalks, each bearing nine large flowers of a deep crimson and pink colour. The formation of the stalks and outer petals of the flower, remind one of the Crinum Amabile, but much larger. We had no communication as a guide to its culture, but kept it at all times, and in all season, associated with the most hardy green-houseplants.– Dunkeld Gardens, 24th May. By the death of Sir James Montgomery, the office of Presenter of Signatures in Scotland has become vacant. We understand that this office is no longer to be conducted by deputy. On Thursday the 23d ult. the United Associate Congregation, Kendal, gave a unanimous call to Mr William Ritchie, preacher, to be their pastor.  ID308 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1841 	12 	29 	inform 	Theatre Royal. –The Pantomine, we observe, is postponed till Friday. Meanwhile, the theatre is crowded nightly, the public being admitted at second price from the commencement of the performances. Music Hall. –We stated, about two month ago, that, in connection with other improvements in the Assembly Rooms, a plan was under consideration for erecting a Music Hall. We are now happy to announce, that at a meeting of the proprietors of the Rooms last week, full pwers were given to the Directors to take the requisite steps for carrying the design into execution. The desire so long felt by the cultivators of music here, will soon be realisd, by the erection of a splendid hall, constructed with a due regard to the accommodation both of professional men and the public, and with a minute attention to the most recent improvements, by which full effect is secured to musical performances when conducted on a grand scale. By what may be called a propitious coincidence, Mr Bishop, the new Professor of Music, arrived in Edinburgh on the very day when this resolution was come to. Martin's Paintings. –The exhibition of these celebrated paintings in this city has already, we believe, attracted many visitors. They are truly wonderful creations, and possess a power and grandeur of which the engravings, so familiar to the public, convey but a faint conception. In contemplating the Deluge, the spectator is so [?] [?] [?] the scene, that he is apt to overlook the details; but these will be found on inspection to be among the most interesting features of the picture. The groups of perishing beings are exquisitely wrought, while everything is made to contribute to the terrific grandeur of the catastrophe. The other two pictures–Pandemonium and the Rivers of Bliss, are smaller in size, but equally indicative of the high poetic genius of the artist. Nothing could be more striking than the contrast these pictures present to each other–the one fearful beyond expression, the other exhibiting a heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the eye rests with delight. There are several other valuable paintings in this collection, amongst which is The Offering Up of Isaac, a Rembrandt in fine preservation. Gordon's British Diorama. –This beautiful exhibition opened on Saturday last, and has, we understand, been crowded with visitors ever since. It will be seen by Mr Gordon's advertisement in to-day's paper, that the view of the Tower of London during the recent conflagration (to which we alluded in our last) has now arrived, and is being exhibited along with the other views. Broughton-place Congregation.–We understand that the call given by BroughtonPlace Congregation to the Rev. Mr Croon, Sanquhar, to be colleague to the Rev. Dr. Brown, has not been accepted, owing to the strong claims which the affectionate people among whom he presently labours have to continuance of his services, and his unfitness, as he alleges, for a charge so laborious; a result which, we learn, has caused among the members of Broughton-Place extreme and general regret. Cooke's Equestrian Amphitheatre, Leith. –Mr Cooke has generously handed over to the Provost, for the benefit of the Destitute Sick Society, the handsome sum of t15; being the free proceeds of Friday evening's entertainment, which took place under the patronage of the Provost and Magistrates. Captain Ross' Discoveries. –Extracts from Captain Ross' despatches have been published in a Parliamentary paper. From the map which accompanies the paper, we gain a more distinct idea of his track than the previous article copied from the Athenean[?] afforded. South Victoria Land, which he discovered, extends in latitude from 70 1/2 south to 79, how much farther is unknown; and in longitude its eastern coast lies between 163 and 171. Its position is directly south from New Zealand, and at the distance of 1500 geographical miles. The length of the part seen was fully 500 miles. It was girt with a border of ice many miles in breadth, which rendered it inaccessible. The passage southward was closed at latitude 78 by a barrier of ice 150 feet high, which was traced for 300 miles east from Victoria Land. Icebergs were encountered in numbers after they passed parallel of 63, and pack ice at 66. The land rose in lofy peaks from 9000 to 12,000 feet in height, perfectly covered with eternal snow; the glaciers descended from near the mountain summits, project many miles into the ocean, and presented a perpendicular face of lofty cliffs. They could not reach the mainland, but landed on an island, which they found to consist of volcanic rocks. On 28th January, in latitude 77 1/2, longitude 169 E., they discovered a magnificent volcano, emitting smoke and flame in a splendid profusion, and named it Mount Erebus. An extinct one near it was named after the other vessel, Mount Terror. At the distance of less than half a mile from the ice cliffs which barred their progress southward, they had sound ings with 318 fathoms. These cliffs, no doubt, reached the bottom, and, including the 150 feet above water, must have had an elevation fo 2000 feet of thereabout. The observations on the dip and declination induced them to place the South Magnetic Pole in latitude 76, and east longitude 153; and they considered its position as well ascertained as if they had reached it, though their nearest approach to it was a point 160 miles from it, on the east coast of Victoria Land. The pole is probably within that region, though this cannot be positively affirmed, as its western boundary is unknown. The highest latitude they reached 78. 4. They were therefore only 12 degrees from the pole and about 4 degrees nearer to it than Captain Weddel[?], the most successful of their predecessors. The Non-intrusion Disclosures. –In the Advertiser of yesterday there is a letter from J. M. Hog, Esq. of Newliston, and another from the Rev. Dr Simpson of Kirknewton, both expressing their extreme surprise at the letter of Mr Hamilton (which appeared in our last), and strongly disclaiming all connexion with it on the part of the General Assembly's Committee. Sabbath Observance–The Sweetie Case. –We understand that the Government of Prussia, thinking that the mode of keeping the Sabbath in that country was in some respects too lax, recently sent over a person to this country, to learn whether our practise in Britain would not furnish hints for improvement. Unluckily, the very first specimens of our piety which met him were the sweetie case, and that of the poor man Key who was excommunicated for burying his child on Sunday. These will of course figure in the very front of the officer's report as the natural fruits of our system, and we may guess what their effect will be in reconciling the Germans to a stricter observance of Sunday! We can, moreover, inform Butters' prosecutors, that the fame of their exploits has already travelled, by the aid of the Teutonic newspapers, to the uttermost parts of Germany, to the infinite amusement of the Swabian farmers, the Saxon miners, and the shepherds of the Riesengeberge. Key's case is no doubt destined to enjoy equal celebrity. Airdrie–Anti-Corn-Law Conference. – On Monday last, the members of the United Secession Church, Airdrie, favourable to a repeal of the Corn and Provision Laws, met, in compliance with the request of the Committee taking the active management of the Conference to be held in Edinburgh on the second week in January next on that subject, when they unanimously appointed their pastor, the Rev. Matthew M'Gavin, A.M., Mr John Craig Waddell, proprietor, and Mr James Forrester, merchant in Airdrie, to represent their sentiments at that meeting, which is looked forward to with great interest by the liberal portion of the inhabitants of the burgh. The Rev. Mr Taylor, with Messrs Adam Nimmo, contractor, and John Young, bookseller, will represent the Independent congregation; and Mr Thomas Muir, pastor of the Baptist church, will represent that body on that occasion. Kirkcudbright–Address to the Dean of Faculty, –We learn that at a meeting, held on the 17th current, of the Clerks and Procurators of the Steward and COmmissary Courts, an address was voted to Alexander Wood, Esq. on his appointment to the office of Dean of Faculty, and his retirement from that of Steward of Kirkcudbright. Distress in Paisley. –We understand that the Bookbinders of Edinburgh purpose to give a Grand Musical Melange in a few days, the proceeds of which are to be handed over to the committee for the distressed weavers in Paisley. Musselburgh. –Mr Wilson, Treasurer to the Honest Town, has, by the hands of the district committeesm collected from the contributors to the Prince of Wales fund, nearly t100; and the committees have already distributed 130 tons of coals to the necessitous families in the neighbourhood. Presbytery of Dalkeith–Case of Mr Monroe. –This Presbytery met on Tuesday the 21st current. At a former meeting an agent appeared for Mr Monroe, presentee to Fala, and laid on the table of Presbytery a presentation in his favour to the parish of Fala. It having been objected that the presentation, and some other papers relative thereton, bore, that Mr Monroe was presented merely to the parish of Fala, and not to the united parishes of Fala and Soutra, the agent made his appearance again at the meeting, which was held on Tuesday, with a supplementary presentation, and also a letter acceptance from Mr Monroe. The agent, when asked, admitted that he had not with him a Presbyterial certificate; and he stated, that he would not ask the Presbytery to sustain the presentation with relative papers at that meeting. But he intimated, that he intended to appear at the next meeting, which is appointed to be held on the 22d of February, and he expected to be able to show that the Presbytery should then sustain the presentation and relative documents. Splendid Meteor. –On Tuesday evening, about eight o'clock, a meteor of unusal size and splendour was witnessed in this quarter. The evening was very clear, the sky being without a cloud, and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly, a dazzling blaze of light burst from the sky, illuminating Benlomond and the distant hills, the Curse around Craigforth, and, indeed, the earth and air on every side as far as the eye could reach, with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The phenomenon appeared like a ball of fire, of an oblong shape, and apparently almost twice the size of the moon, having at the time somewhat of the same silvery appearance as that luminary, but flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to dazzle the eyes. A tail of fire somewhat resembling that of a rocket, but composed of the most beautifully varied colours, streamed behind it for a short distance, adding much to its spendour, and giving the whole an appearance at once singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it disappeared, it assumed a red glowing appearance, and then burst for an instant enveloping the earth and sky in a blaze as bright and dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared to pass from the south to the north, inclining towards the earth. To the eye it seemed to burst and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another meteor of the same kind, but much less in size, brilliancy, and splendour, was observed falling in a quartr rather farther to the south, a few minutes previously. It is a coincidence worthy of notice, that a meteor, of the same nature with that first described in the above, was seen at the same hour in Glasgow.– Stirly Journal. Glasgow. –The collection made on Sabbath afternoon last, by the Rev. Mr Macfarlane's congregation, Nicholson Street, Glasgow, amounted to t46, 7s. 6d. This sum is the more praiseworthy when it is considered that this congregation has within a few months subscribed among themselves nearly t1000 for the erection of their beautiful place of worship to be called Erskine Church, of which they are erelong to take possession. The Unemployed in Paisley.–The number of unemployed in Paisley has last week decreased by 43. In Kilbarchan and Barrhead they were still on the increase. The following is the official report of yesterday for Paisley and Barrhead :– Paisley. Males, 1865 Dependants, 4662 –6527 Females, 1680 Dependants, 3360 –5040 Total, 11,567 Barrhead. December 17, 287 ... 23, 346 Increase, 59 – Paisley Advertiser. The Paisley Manufacturing Committee. –This Committee continue to carry on their operations with energy and zeal. The amount of the fund now exceeds t8000, and is still on the increase. They have given out about 700 webs already, and are as busy as possible preparing more. Unable to get a sufficiency of webs warped in Paisley, they have sent for assistance in this respect both to Glasgow and Johnstone. A good deal of work has this week been given to warpers, winders and heddle-casters. They have taken much more spacious premises in Gilmour Street, in order that they may the more easily supply both town and country weavers. It is desirable that the implement fund should be somewhat enlarged, as the other funds of the Committee are not trenched on for that purpose – Ibid. Ducal Generosity.–After the late county meeting at Hamilton, at which addresses were voted to the Queen and Prince Albert, his Grace the Duke of Hamilton and several of those who had attended the meeting visited the jail. One respectable looking female attracted his Grace's attention; and on inquiry he was told that she was the widow of a respectable wood merchant, now deceased, and had been confined for upwards of a year, at the instance of a law agent in Edinburgh, for costs incurred in a suit in the Court of Session. His Grace immediately caused the truth of the poor woman's story to be investigated, and on being satisfied of the facts he caused the debt to be paid by his factor, and procured the woman's liberation, who has thus through his Grace's generosity been restored to liberty and to the superintendence of her young family.– Reformers' Gazette. Presentation. –A number of the members of the United Secession Church, Airdrie, met in their vestry on the evening of Wednesday the 22d inst. when Councillor Brown, in name of the congregation, presented the Rev. M. M'Gavin, A.M., their pastor, with a handsome pulpit gown and cassock, as a mark of their respect and esteem; after which a number of the influential members of the congregation entertained him to supper supper in Mr Witherspoon's King's Arms Inn– Mr Daniel Gray, collector, Coltness Railway, in the chair, and Dr Clarkson, croupier–when the evening was spent in the most friendly, happy, and intellectual manner. A Rescue.–Last week, while the Duke of Hamilton was riding along the wood leading from Hamilton to Bothwell, he heard the screams of a female, and on looking towards the place whence the cries came, he perceived a stout Irishman belabouring a woman in a most unmerciful style. No sooner did he observe this, than he rode up to the scene of cruelty, dismounted from his horse, knocked the savage down, rescued the woman, and sent her home rejoicing, with more money in her pocket than it may have been her lot to possess for a long time. When we recollect that his Grace was born so long ago as October 1767, and so is in his 75th year, we cannot sufficiently admire his gallantry, humanity, and intrepidity– Glasgow Chronicle. Town Council. –The usual meeting of Council did not take place yesterday in consequence of the Christmas holidays. House of Industry. –We understand that Miss Grace Bailie had left a legacy to the Edinburgh House of Industry of ten pounds sterling. Old Church.–The Lords of her Majesty's Treasury have officially intimated to the parties interested their intention to adhere to the original arrangement made with the Town Council, for altering the Assembly Aisle, and rendering it fit to be permanently used as a place of worship for the accomodation of one of the city congregations. Prince of Wales Fund. –In the table of sums subscribed in the different Wards of Police, published in our paper of Saturday last, that indicated for the 26th Ward was t120, 12s. 9d. Mr Lindores, the General Commissioner, requests us to state, that the sum subscribed in his Ward was t275, 12s. 9d., and that the difference between the two sums is the amount of the very handsome subscriptions by the Banks in St Andrew Square, and which were drawn by the Treasurer. Presentation of Plate. –On Friday afternoon, about fifty citizens entertained Mr William Donaldson, of the Albion Cloth Company, to an elegant dinner and dessert, in the Turf Hotel, Princes Street, for the purpose of presenting him with a testimonial of their esteem, subscribed for by the members of the Celtic Lodge, and other private friends. Mr William Wright, hat manufacturer, was in the chair, supported on the right and left by the guest of the evening, Mr Pritchard of the Theatre-Royal, and other gentlemen. Mr Dick of the Albion officiated as croupier. After the usual loyal and preliminary toasts had been given, the chairman called for a bona fide bumper for the toast of the evening, and, after passing a handomse eulogium on those various qualities of their guest which had endeared him to all his friends, neighbours, and acquaintances, far and wide, presented to Mr Donaldson, in the name of the subscribers, a very elegant and massive silver tea set, of the value of t50. Mr Donaldon's health was then proposed and drunk with warm and friendly enthusiasm. The presentee replied to the compliment in modest and appropriate terms. The company spent an exceedingly happy and convivial night; the chairman and croupier taking care that there should be no flagging in the jovialty. The toasts were suitable to the occasion. Mr Mackenzie's instrumental band played appropriate airs to the various toasts and sentiments; and vocal music, from amateurs, was never wanting; the guest himself being a host in that department. The following inscription is neatly engraved on the various pieces of playe :–To Mr William Donaldson, R.W.M. of the Lodge Celtic of Edinburgh and Leith, from a number of Masonic and other Friends.–24th Dec. 1841. Theft and Recovery of a Pony. –At a late hour on Sunday night a gentleman residing in the southern part of the town dismounted from his pony at his own gate, and proceeding inwards, leaving the animal to follow, as he was wont to do, to the stable. On looking about, he observed a young man, whom he supposed to be his son, take the reins and mount the pony. Shortly afterwards the son came into the house, and the question of Where is the pony? soon convinced the parties that it was stolen. They immediately proceeded in search, and while the gentleman was giving information at the Police-Office, his son discovered the pony with a rider on the North Bridge. He immediately seized the reins and made a clutch at the thief; but the latter very adroitly threw himself off at the opposite side, ran down the Fleshmarket stairs, and escaped. Providential Recovery. –One day last week, a fine little child, about five years of age, belonging to one of the villagers at Ratho, having dandered[?] away with another little play-fellow, like himself, to a little distance from the house, fell into a deep well. His companion was found standing weeping at the edge. The apparently dead body of the little one being got out, was taken home, and all hopes of its recovery given up, when Dr Pringle, and excellent young gentleman, who is presently assistant of Dr Craig at Ratho, made his appearance, and, by applying himself with indefatiguable perseverance, succeeded in recalling the apparently extinguished spark. The next the little romp was as lively as ever. Mungo Park. –A public meeting was held in the town hall of Selkirk, on Monday the 26th current, the Chief Magistrate in the chair; when various resolutions were adopted with the view of erecting a monument or other permanent mark of respect for the memory of this celebrated traveller. Thimble-Riggers. –A band of thimble-riggers from Edinburgh have for several weeks past been infesting the roads in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. They are six in number and one of them, an old man of rather respectable appearance, is generally in advance of the party, and having got into conversation with a passenger on the road, and the others running up, and desiring the old man to try his luck; he does so, and winning a trifle, he easily persuades the person with whom he has been ingratiating himself to try also, and he is soon robbed of his whole spare cash. Information having, on Wednesday last, been given to the Procurator-Fiscal at Pollokshaws, and the gang were on the new Kilmarnock Road, he immediately despatched two rural police officers in pursuit of them. On the officers coming up to the gang, they separated and ran off, but the officers captured two of them (the old man and another), who were safely lodged in Pollokshaws Jail; and having been brought before two of the Justices, and several person having sworn to being defrauded by them of their money, they were sentenced tothirty days' imprisonment in Paisley House of Correction, with hard labour, as rogues and vagabonds; and an active look-out is made by the police for the remainder of the gang. Stoppage of Payments by the Town of Paisley. –Partly on account of the great depression of trade, and partly on account of a run raised by the circulation of malicious and false statements regarding the affairs of the community of Paisley, theTown Council, at a meeting on Wednesday evening, ordered the Chamberlain to susspend receipt or payment of deposits, in the meantime, but to proceed with all possible despatch in realizing the outstanding debts due to the community for the regular payment of the interest on the money borrowed, and other current engagements of the burgh. It is pretty generally known that a small portion of the would-be-political leaders of the town who have not the influence to get themselves placed in municipal authority, have for a good number of years endeavoured to embarass the party in power, by attacking the credit of the community. The unfavourabout state of trade and the leniency of the Council in not enforcing during the last year the exactions on the owners of property, for entries, &c. falling due, caused a deficiency of nearly t300 in the usual amount of revenue. This simple circumstance was taken advantage of, though nothing was lost thereby, and statements prejudicial to the town's credit were placed in the hands of every credito that could be found by the individuals referred to, and thus uncalled for alarm raised. In addition to this, the adherents of the same party in the Council during the last five days gave currency to another statement which they knew to be quite untrue, about the late Provost having commenced to secure himself by drawing a thousand pounds, when the fact was he had not drawn out a penny. From the position to which which the affiars the town are now driven a full and public exposure of these matters will soon be submitted to the creditors. The Council have been negotiating for such a loan of money as will pay off those who are dissatisfied, which in the ordinary state of the money market they would long since have obtained, though at present that is difficult. As regards risk to the creditors, from the best informed quarters we are assured there is none. More than one-third of the whole debts of the town are due to the Bank and the members of Council, or their immediate friends, and fully a half of the debt against the river is due to the same parties. This we should conceive the strongest proof that could be adduced of the confidence of those who should best know the state of the town's affairs.– Glasgow Chronicle. Disgraceful Trick.–At a late wake in the country, a short way from Crieff, a waggish fellow tied a cord secretly to the neck of the corpse and while a number of young men and women present were going on merrily with some sport the wag pulled the cord, when corpse started up in the bed, making the clothes to fly off; the whole party rushed to the door, crying for mercy upon them, and knocking each other over in the hurry, when at length some people came to their assistance, who afterwards discovered the cause of their terror.– Perth Courier. The Church Question. –Long ago, Dr Chalmers let out the secret of the clerical movement, by declaring that very little of Non-intrustion would satisfy him and his friends, provided the independent power of the Church were secured. Now, this liberum arbitrium does nothing at all for Non-intrusion; but it does a great deal for Church Independence. It confers no privilege on the laity; but it adds immeasurably to the power of the clergy. It is, in fact, the very worst part of the claims that have been advanced by the Church; and its effects would simply be to sacrifice the lay Non-intrusionists on the one hand, and clerical Moderates on the other. It means literally uncontrolled power to the Church The General Steam Navigation Company's ship Monarch, Captain Fraser, arrived at Granton from London on Monday evening at half-past nine o'clock. Election of a Minister for Old Monk- land. –The election of a minster took place at Old Monkland Church, on Thursday the 23d inst., and the right of patronage being vested in the Heritors and Kirk-Session, the election might be considered a popular one. About 150 voters attended the meeting, and a decided wish having been expressed by, it is understood, the whole of the heritors that no candidate known to be connected with the Non-intrusion party in the Church should be chosen, the meeting, acting upon this principle, unanimously agreed to elect the Rev. Mr Johnston, Greenock, as minister of the parish. Considering the number of voters, the unanimity that prevailed among the electors, it is believed, is without precedent and stongly marks the sentiments and feelings of a large and very populous parish on the present proceedings of the dominant party in th Church. Mr Johnston was proposed by General Pye Douglass of Rosehall, seconded by Mr M'Caul of Daldowie, and unanimously elected.– Reformers' Gazette. Destructive Fire. –About three o'clock on the morning of the 25th curt., an alarm of fire was given at Balmangan Mill, in the parish of Rerwick. The premises are occupied by Mr Kissock, and despite the great exertions of himself, servants and neighbours, the work of destruction proceeded with a degree of rapidity that rendered it impossible to save a single article. The flames in their fury having charred the rafters, the roof fell in with a loud crash; and, before long, the entire mill, with the exception of the side walls, became an unbroken mass of ruins. The building contained a considerable quantity of grain and oatmeal, the property of the tacksman, all of which was unforunately destroyed. As the premises were found quite safe a very few hours previously, suspicion of incendiarism have naturally arisen, but no clue thus far has been found attaching guilt to a single individual. The fire, if wilful, implies the blackest malice, and it is sad to think that any one could have been so wicked as to destroy what thousands are in want of, and would gladly toil for, if they only knew how–daily bread– Dumfries Courier. Hamilton. –Some influential persons in Hamilton and the neighbourhood have subscribed to build an Episcopal chapel in that town. We have been informed that all the requisite arrangements have been made for carrying the views of the subscribers into effect. This is one effect of the conduct of the rebellious majority of the General Assembly. Many of thsoe now friendly to the scheme, never dreamed of espousing Episcopacy, till they have been driven in disgust from the Church of their fathers, by the conduct of their ministers; men who exist in their offices by law, and yet set that very law at defiance, in virtue of which they hold offices, and draw their temporalities, as they cantingly term their good things, which alone induce some of them, at least, to remain members of the venerable Establishment. Who would have believed, some years ago, that Black Prelacy was about to be established within sight of Bothwell Brigg!  ID335 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	05 	09 	inform 	Halifax, April 6. The late violent rains have done much damage in the country:–The bridge at Sackville is nearly torn down, and the Mill there is much injured: the Bridge at Nine Mills River is partly carried away; and the different roads and causeways are supposed to have suffered more than 2000l. will repair. Since the retreat of the f–eral troops, under General Harmar, the Miami Indians have committed unparalleled cruelties. A large body of them, on the 2d of February, attacked the settlements called Big Bottom, twenty miles from Harman, on the Muilsingam, which they entirely destroyed. Eleven men and two children were massacred, two escaped and three were taken prisoners. Boston. The amount of the value of theexports from the United States, for thirteen months, agreeable to an estimate made at the Office of the Treasury, in 20,000,000 dollars. The greatest apprehensions are entertained of an invasion from our savage neighbours; as accounts from Philadelphia state, that there has been a confederation of all the South West Indians to fall on our frontiers early in the spring. Similiar apprehensions have driven the inhabitants in the country of Marcetta, from their plantations into the city, where they do military duty. According to the late Census, the number of inhabitants in this commonwealth is 470,000. Philadelphia, April 7. Congress met here to-day and made a house, Articles of the Constitution, that were not liked by many of us, are altered much for the better– among other things, we were dissatisfied that not any notice was taken of Religion, as we wanted it expressly declared, that not any sect should ever be established in preference to another.–This is now done. In this part of the world we know not any thing of Toleration–all are equally free. It is said we have land for upwards of an hundred millions of people; we are yet about three, so that,for sometime we have have not any great cause to fight for territory.  ID97 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1794 	09 	12 	entertain 	The laws of the State of Pennsylvania, and that of Massachusetts, by which the punishment of death is abolished, in all cases except for wilful murder, are about to be adopted by the respective Legislatures of all the other States. The system of the great and merciful???caria, has taken place of the sanguinary Penal laws of England. The abolition of Negro slavery, which has taken shape in the five New England States of New Hampshire, Massachusets, Rhode island, Connecticut, and Vermont; in the Midland States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delawar; and in the Western State of Kentucky, for several years past is now extended, by act of Congress to the Southern States of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Maryland; and the emancipation of the remainder of that unfortunate race of men is to take place on or before the fifth of November, 1795. The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts has g???ed a part of the public lands to the emancipated Negroes of that State, in proportion to the numbers of the respective families, where the liberal and philanthropic mind is gratified, by seeing them erect villages cultivate farms, and form communities of civilized Societies. Before the Gentleman, who has favoured us with this Intelligence, left America, they had established a Lodge of Masonry; and he had the satisfaction of seeing them on a grand day, parade to Church in all the magnificence of the Order, where a sermon was preached, on the occasion, by one of their own colour. They have also endowed public schools, employed??? and erected places of Public Worship. The Officers, Non-commissioned Officers, and Soldiers, who served in the Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country, have at last received a reward, infinitely beyond their expectations, but every way corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic. Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress, this last Session, to each individual, who served throughout the war; and to the defendants of those who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature, and eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value, to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran, as has been the case of former grants, he is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money, at the present market price, from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land, and the rest in money,a s may be most agreeable to the receiver. The Mint of the United States, which was established two years since, has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles, half eagles, and quarter eagles. The first is exactly five and forty shillings, English money, or ten American coin. The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half, and quater, which makes the courie of exchange simple, and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive, that ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle. There is, besides, one more silver coin, which is called a Dime, and is the tenth part of a dollar. The copper coin is called a Cent, and is the tenth part of a Dime. Six of the ships of war, which were voted by Congress in November last, are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next, and will complete a fleet of??? hundred guns. The city of Washington, which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States, will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence, and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city, as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground near the banks of the Potamac, possessing a delightful water prospect, together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city. From the President's house to the Capitol, run two great pleasure parks or malls, which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac, and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol, as well as those of the President's house, are of the finest marble. The building of these superb edifices has been much retarded by the want of stone cutters, masons, bricklayers, carpenters, and blacksmiths, who at this time actually receive the enormous wages of ten shillings American currency per day. The district of Country at the back of North Carolina, reaching to the Mississippi, and covering a country six hundred miles long by three hundred broad, is next winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the Province of Maine, extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the river St. Croix, is expected to form a Seventeenth. The new cities build in America since her independence are Grenville, in the State of Georgia; Martenberg, the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia, the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and Nashville, in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville, Fairfield, and Lex ington, in the State of Kentucky; Washington, the Capital of the United States; Sunbury, in the State of Pennsylvania; Hudson, upon Husdon's River, and Cooper's Town, in the State of New York; Bennington, in the State of Vermont; and Paterson, in the State of New Jersey. All the towns burnt by the English in the was, have been rebuilt, and the old cities of Charlestown, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, have been extended to more than double the extent they had before the peace. The population of the United States, by the last Census in 1790, was more than double what it was in 1775, by which it appears, that America doubles her number of people every fifteen years. The emigrations from the different nations in Europe to that country, are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually. The increase of farms and villages has been so great as to people four new States, and to extend their Settlements from the Atlantic to the Ohio in the South, and from the Atlantic to the Lakes on the River St. Lawrence in the North.
