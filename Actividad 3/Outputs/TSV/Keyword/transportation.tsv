The victualling the convicts on the voyage is included in the contract.  ID19 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	10 	02 	inform 	There are no less than 130 women going out in the transports to Botany Bay; among the female convicts destined for this settlement, there was one so beautiful, that it was thought a pity to send her abroad, and she is therefore preferred for home cultivation.  ID54 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	12 	04 	inform 	Extract of a letter from Portsmouth, Nov. 23. The convicts already arrived at this port from Newfoundland, are near fourscore in number; a few others are expected. These unhappy wretches are almost destitute of every sort of covering, and some of them are labouring under sickness and infirmity. Their story is accurateas follows: About the middle of last June, this miserable class of beings, to the amount of 102 men and boys, and twelve women, all of whom were convicts, were embarked at Dublin, on board the Duke of Leinster transport, the owners of which, who are Dublin merchants, contracted with the Government of Ireland for carrying the convicts to the North American States. After the ship had been at sea five weeks, part of which was foul weather, the provision is said to have fallen short ; the master of the transport, Capt. Harrison, accordingly stood in for Newfoundland and lay-to till night; when he disembarked at Bull's Bay, and a little distance from it, with as much secrecy as possible, his desperate freight. To prevent this proceeding being too early early known, he landed with them provision for the immediate supply of their wants, and bore away with a press of sail. The hungry victims lived for three days in a state of warfare, quarrelling about their food ; the strongest beat the weak, and over a cask of rank butter or beef, there was for a time as severe fighting as if a kingdom had been at stake. They reached the town of St. John's on the 20th of July ; and exhibited the most appaling procession ever seen in that country : the inhabitants had immediate councils; and the military and navy co-operating, a place of security was fixed upon at a distance from the town, and they were lodged ; here under a guard. Here the Irish howl was nightly sung in full chorus, and the centinels were frequently frighted with the noise while on their posts. A battle or two every half hour kept them festive all day; and when the provision supplied to them by the inhabitants was lessening, they broke away, and laid hold of every thing that was eatable, without enquiring whether it had an owner. Some of these poor wretches were anxious to be received into the service of the inhabitants and probably might have reformed, if so fostered. But all of them have a claim to the charity of this country for that supply of raiment which is necessary to guard them against the inclement weather.  ID100 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1794 	02 	14 	inform 	At four o'clock yesterday morning Mess. Muir, Skirving, and Margarot, were taken from their beds, without any previous notice, hand-cuffed, and put into a post-chaise, to be conveyed to Woolwich, where a vessel waits to sail with them immediately for Botany Bay. Mr. Palmer has, we understood, been sent from on board the hulks, in the same manner, to take his passage on board the same vessel. Between 10 and 11 o'clock, about sixty female convicts were put on board a vessel at Blackfriars bridge, destined to the same voyage. These latter behaved in a most turbulent manner and even fought in the hold of the boat. There were among them one or two well dressed women ; and what was more lamentable in the eyes of the spectator, some of had infants with them.  ID112 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1814 	05 	26 	inform 	A proclamation, issued by Governor Macquarrie, appears in the Sidney Gazette of 14th May, stating that Peter Mills Acting Deputy Surveyor of Lands at Port Dalrymple, Van Dieman's Land, and George Williams, Acting Deputy Commissary of Stores and provisions at the said settlement, had absconded from their habitations, and fled to the woods ; that their object was to live by rapine and violence ; to effect which they had armed themselves, and taken the command of a gang of 26 desperadoes, with whose aid they had committed numerous robberies–entering the lands of settlers, driving away their cattle, and plundering their houses. The proclamation declares that those who shall return to their houses and occupations before 1st December next, shall be pardoned and saved harmless from all offences, except the crime of wilful murder ; and denounces those who shall disregard this offer, as outlaws. Sydney, New South Wales, Jan. 4. The Argo has arrived with a most extensive supply of tea, viz, 167 chests of souchong, 200 ditto bobea, 200 hyson skin, and young hyson 50 ; in all 617 chests. The consequences has been a reduction in the price of souching from 30s to 5s per lb currency. Shortly prior to the Argo's departure from the Island of Mauritius, the Hope American ship, laden with tea and sundies, valued at L80,000, was captured by his Majesty's sloop Harpy, Captain Allen. In consequences of the oppressive conduct of several masters of colonial and British ships, and of their crews towards the natives of New Zealand, of Otaheite, and of the other islands in the South Pacific Ocean, which have led to the destruction of several vessels, with their crews, by the natives, and disturbed all trade and intercourse with those islands, both by British shipping and that ofthe allied powers–his Excellency has forbidden any vessel to clear out from any place in New South Wales, without a bond given by the master or owner to the naval officer for the time being at the port, for L.1000 sterling, binding him and his crew not to commit any act of hostility, or to be guilty of any trespass, or forment any animosities between the natives, or take any part in any war that may prevail ; nor forcibly carry away any male or female inhabitants of the islands under penalty of forfeiting the sum specified in the bond. A small party, who a short time ago undertook[?] a land passage in a direction towards Broken Bay, for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and fertility of the country, have discovered an excellent grazing track of 8000acres. In consequence of which one gentlemen, Mr Robert Campbell, has already sent thither an extensive herd of cattle, and this example is likely to be followed by others. Thomas West, who came to this colony a convict for life, in the ship Earl Cornwall's[?], in 1801, has received from his Excellency a conditional pardon, in consideration of his general good conduct and character for sobriety and industry, and also in consideration of his having lately erected a water mill for the grinding of grain at Barcorn Glen, within two miles of Sydney, being the first water mill ever erected in the vicinty of this town. Sydney, New South Wales, May 21. The good understanding between the natives and our settlers, which had been maintained for the last six years, has given place to frequent outrages attended with fatal consequences. On Saturday, a body of 60 natives commenced plundering the fields of a settler, when three privates of the veteran battalion fired upon them and killed a boy. The narushed upon them before they could load again, and killed on private, Isaac Eustace, and compelled the other two to fly. They then plundered the ground of Messrs Milehouse and Butcher. Next day a party of 14 soldiers falling in with them, shot a woman and two children–the savages attacked William Baker, a stock-keeper of Mr MacArthur, killed the man and two women, named Sullivan and Herburg. Sydney, New South Wales, Feb. 12. On Monday last arrived the ship General Hewett, Captain Earle, from England, having a detachment of the 46th regiment, commanded by Major Oglivie ; and yesterday arrived the Windham, Captain Bligh, also from England, having on board the head-quarters of the 46th regiment, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Molle, who succeeded Lieutenant-Colonel O'Connell, as Lieutenant-Governor of the territory, and is accompanied by Mrs Molle and family ; also Lieutenant Walters, of the navy, agent for transports– Of the 300 convicts which the General Hewett received on board, 35 died on the passage.  ID123 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1818 	01 	19 	inform 	Extract of a letter from the agent to at the Cape of Good Hope, dated 15th Nov. 1817: – The following most daring instance of piracy was committed in our harbour on the 11th inst. viz.– The Elizabeth, White, lying at anchor off Robin Island, with about 120 tons of oil on board, was boarded at about one a. m. by a party of armed deserters from his Majesty's 10th regiment, and convicts, about 12 in number, i. e. five soldiers and seven convicts, who, after securing the hatches, &c. obtained possession of the ship, and in the same instant cut the cables, loosed the sails, and favoured by a strong S. E. wind, succeeded in carrying her off, at six a.m. The captain and crew having refused to listen to their invitation to join them in their piratical undertaking, with the exception of the mate, were permitted to leave the ship in the boat, which reached Robin Island in safety about four o'clock the same day. By a letter received to-day we learn that the Admiral Gambier, Brash, laden with Government stores for Ceylon, was totally lost on the morning of the 20th of June last, having struck on the reef Roan de Nova, in the Mozambique Channel ; crew saved. A letter from Halifax, dated the 27th Nonember, says – Colonel Bouchette, Surveyor - General of Lower Canada, with Captain Campbell, of the 60th regiment, and Mr Bouchette, jun. arrived here on the 19th inst. The only information I can yet give you is, that the exploring survey has been extended from the source of the St Croix river to the river Restigouche, in line about 100 miles ; in this short distance both parties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the severest nature. The Americans employed on the same line with our English Commissioners are represented as men of great ability, and acting with that spirit of liberality that infuses confidence on each side, rendering their arduous task less severe and gloomy than was to have been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this quarter. Our trade continues dull, and money scarce. Government bills are 3 per cent advance, but expected to be lower, in consequence of the Commissary-General having refused to take the provincial notes. Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard –On Friday night, about half-past nine o'clock, this place was thrown into the greatest consternation, by the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard, the beating of drums, and the firing of the men of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire having broken out in the house belonging to the steam engine erected for carrying on the new works situated in the southern part of the dock - yard, near the kilns used for burning cement stone. The most serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and what was more distressing to the feelings of the spectators, was its coniguity to the workhouse, which, from the pressure of the times and want of employment, is crowded with many unfortunate individuals. Providence, however, averted the impending danger, and about twelve o'clock we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames subdued, with only the loss of the engine-house. No lives, it is understood, have been lost, but one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker of the Northumberland, and the officers of that ship, Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter, and Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary, with the military officers and soldiers of the garrison, assembled on the first alarm. The latter were under arms the whole time, and were of great service in keeping off the spectators. The inhabitants of the twon were at one time under serious apprehensions, as the fire was not far from the Fountain tavern, and the residence of Mr Miller, in High Street. At the former, the landlady of the house had but recently lain in, and was removed on the first alarm being given. Sir Robert Barlow, from Chatham, who superintends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle, was here yesterday to investiage into the cause, which it is suspected arose from carlessness – The damage, however, has not been so great as was at first expected, and which it might have been but for the prompt and effectual assistance that was given – Sheerness, January 11  ID139 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1819 	05 	01 	inform 	Leeds, April 19.–We have been somewhat alarmed here to-day, though no bad consequences have followed, by a most numerous assemblage of croppers, cloth-dressers, and other artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep com ing in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley, Armley, Holbeck, and all the neighbouring towns and villages and it is computed that at one time there were full three thousand of these distressed people assembled, chiefly in Briggate. As many of them marched into the town with great sticks in their hands, they created some little alarm, but their conduct was uniformly peaceable; their complaints were not loud, though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and Magistrates, with the whole of the Civil Power, were in rea diness to act as circumstances might require; but, fortunately, there was not the slightest occasion for their interference. By far the greater number of the assemblage dispersed by noon, and returned to their respective homes. Several respectable gentlemen went among them, to ascertain the motives of their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it does not appear that they have the least disposition to commit any breath of the peace ; but in fact, the people know not what to do in their present state of distress. I understand that an active subscription is going, to enable a number of these poor men to proceed to Canada; and others are said to have expressed their wish to be sent to Botany Bay, provided they can obtain the sanction of Government. The case of these people is a very perplexing one ; for their numbers augment daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories. Chester, April 19.–John Bagguely, John Drummond and Samuel Johnson, convicted of sedition on the 15th inst., were this day, after an adrdress from the Chief-Justice (Mr Serjeant Copley,) sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and to find security for their good behaviour for two years, each in L.500 himself with sureties in L.100 each. We are sorry to hear that great number of the agricultural poor are out of employ in Monmouthshire, and that the amount of wages diminishes as works get scarcer. Emigration to America still continues; but it is, for the most part, of a description of person who have afforded employ to others rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some property with them. Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States, there are twenty six persons belonging to one family, (Quakers, of the name of Thistlewaith,) lately residing in Meadow lane, Leeds. These industrious and enterprising individuals are gone with an intention of carrying on the woollen manufacture (in conjunction with others) on an extensive scale, either at Philadelphia or some other more eligible site in its vicinity. Several other families are preparing to emigrate from the same neighbourhood, as well as from Dewsbury, Bradford, and other places in the vicinity. It is true these extensive emigrations may, in some degree, contribute to relieve our overburdened population ; but they must likewise tend, in an equal ratio, to impoverish the nation ; as every individual and family who emigrate, setting aside the pecuniary wealth they carry with them, take what is of far more consequence to a commercial nation–their talents and industry–articles, at present, of comparative small value in the country. The very heavy impost which is at present levied upon authors and publishers, by being compelled, under the existing Copyright Act to deliver eleven copies of every book published to certain public libraries, is likely to be repealed by a Bill to be brought into Parliament in a few days. The body of evidence taken before the Select Committe of the House of Commons last year, forms a most interesting display of the state of literary property in this country. Saturday last Mr Stuart and Mr Allsop were returned for the Borough of Camelford. Yesterday, the Grand Jury for the County of Middlesex found two Bills of Indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury against five of the principal witnesses produced in behalf of the petitioner, who were examined before the Select Committee appointed to try the merits of the election fo Penrhyn. Extraordinary Legacy. –A very singular cause is now depending before the Court of Session in Scotland, respecting a legacy to the amount of upwards of fifty thousand pounds, bequeathed by the late Earl of F. (who died at Berlin) to a foreigner, who was one of his domestic servants. The payment of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the late Earl, on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consideration ; and from its novelty the case is, of course, the subject of much conversation in the Northern Metropolis. The arguments and pleadings in this extraordinary suit, in which the most eminent counsel of the Edinburgh Bar are engaged, display much classical as well as legal learning ; but no judgement has yet been pronounced by the Court. From the magnitude of the sum in dispute, it will probably be finally determined by an appeal to the House of Lords.– Morn. Chron. Town Hall, Southwark. –Thomas Wing was brought up by Reeve, the Marshalman, and examined before Sir John Earner[?], the sitting Magistrate, charged on suspicion of robbing his employers, Messrs Sentance and Flint, grocers, NO. 300. Borough, High-street. The prisoner's detection was caused in the following singular manner :–He was porter to the prosecutors, and was frequently about the shop ; a large house dog having seen him take money from the till, which he tied in his pocket handkerchief, followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a shed near the stables, and then he came into the shop and appeared quite restless, pulling every person by the skirt[?] and apparently wishing them to follow him. At length Henry Heydon, the apprentice, having occasion to go to the stable, the dog followed him, and having drawn his attention to the heap of rubbish, under which the money was buried, began to scratch at it till he brought the booty to view ! The apprentice brought it to his master, who counted, and found it to contain 12s. in copper coin. After marking it he desired the boy to place it in the same spot, which he did, and soon afterwards, finding that it was removed, he asked the prisoner some questions about it, but he declared his ignorance of the whole transaction. Reeve, the Marshalman, was then sent for, who, on searching the prisoner, found some of the marked ballpence[?] in his pocket.–Remanded. Bank Committee. –The Opposition Journals, last wek, asserted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House of Commons intend to report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of paying in specie. That is, the Bank shall pay next January in gold bars at the present price of gold, L.4 1s. per ounce, any quanitity of notes not being less than sixty or a hundred pounds' worth, and that in two years afterwards they shall pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold, L.3, 17s. 10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's plan goes farther. It recommends that the Bank shall never pay in coin, but in bars of gold, at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall at all times buy gold, when offered, at L.3, 17s. and sell it, when demanded, at L.3, 17s. 10 1/2d. If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the Restriction Committee intend to report in favour of payments in bullion at the market price ; and should Parliament adopt that plan ; then there will be a very great saving to the nation in the expense of coinage, the waste of, &c. All the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in foreign commerce, will be answered as well by payments in gold bars as by payments in coins, and the danger of a domestic run on the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic, as in 1797, will be completely prevented. This is, indeed, at all times, the only danger to which it is exposed. A run for coin on the Country Banks would instantly fall on the Bank of England, and would cramp, if not dry up,the currency throughout the empire, producing the greatest confusion. Now, if the Opposition Journals be correct, the currency will be placed in perfect security, at perfect ease. Nothing will be able to disorder it. If persons will hoard specie, they must purchase gold bars or foreign coin, or content themselves with silver. In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the amount of L.800,000 each year, and then the value of gold was rather below the standard price. In the year 1817 we imported to the amount of six millions, and in the year 1818 we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. During the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have an abundant harvest or two, and little importation of corn become necessary, gold will again fall very low. The Bank will then be able to pay, to buy gold to the full extent of Mr Ricardo's plan, and to place their notes on a firm, unquestionable foundation. The finances of the continent, and of the world, indeed–the sources and circulation of money will, during peace, gradually become steadier and better known. The East Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quantity of specie, while Spanish America, in consequence of her troubles, yields far less than usual. It would be madness to fly in the face of all these circumstances, by compelling the Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may be desirable to limit the issue of bank notes to some certain, yet liberal amount. We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the Committee ; but, if some rumours be true, we augur favourably of it. It[?] is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee, and stood alone in voting against the Report. Thus, then, the Report cannot be in favour of a very sudden or decided plan for the resumpion of cash payments, or Mr Tierney would not have voted against it ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable prospect of a rational scheme for that resumption, or the other five or six Opposition Members of the Committee would not have voted for it. – Courier. Grand Pigeon Match, three Gentlemen of the Midgham Club, against thrice of All England, took place on Monday on Farnham Downs, at twenty-one birds, twenty-one yards distance from the gun, for 150 guineas aside, charge unlimited. Messrs Adams, Russel and Holt, were selected from the Crack Club against Messrs King, Short and Keans. The sports were as follows ; Mr Adams killed nineteen birds, and the remaining two were severely hit. Russel killed eighteen, but lost one three yards out of bounds, and Mr Holt bagged sixteen, making a grand total of fifty-two from sixty-three. The Club was at first backed to win, but the England shots were now backed freely at six to four, as they were considered safe eighteen bird men. Mr King killed twenty, but lost two out of bounds. Short missed his first three, which brought betting to two to one onn the Club, but he killed the next seventeen, and missed the last bird. Mr Keans had seventeen to tie, and eighteen to win, and he was back at five to four and at two to one, after killing eleven birds in succession. He, however, missed the seventeenth, and had to kill the other four to win. He succeeded, and the prize was won by once bird. It was altogether the most interesting match of this sort known for years. Letters from Petersburgh, of the 15th ultimo, mention that Prince Gustavus of Sweden, son of King Gustavus IV., has obtained permission from the Emperor, his uncle, to proceed to England, for the purpose of completing his studies at Oxford. Reports speak highly of the virtues and talents of this unfortunate young Prince, who excites universal interest and sympathy in the north of Europe. In these feelings we must largely share, for we cannot easily forget the associations with which the name of Vasa was connected, not the services rendered by two Sovereigns of that Illustrious House to the cause of civil and religious liberty. It is said that a great Potentate, whose generosity and magnanimity are proverbial, has settled upon Prince Gustavus an allowance of L. 2,000 Sterling per annum, during the residence of the latter in England, and that on the return of his Royal Highness to the Continent he is to espouse his cousin, a Princess of Hesse Cassel, who, if rumour be correct, has lately refused a matrimonial alliance with the new Swedish dynasty. Papers arrivedon Saturday from New York and Boston to the 15th ult. The National Intelligencer, in an article occupying five columns, under the head of Strictures on Mr Lacock's Report on the Seminole War, defends the sanguinary proceedings of General Jackson. This production is said to have excited a great sensation throughout the United States, being supposed to express the sentiments of the Executive. The General had left Washington for his residence in Tenessee. By an arrival from Aux Cayes, intelligence was stated to be received that Sir G M'Gregor's troops had deserted him, owing to the want of funds for their subsistence.  ID195 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1824 	01 	31 	inform 	Hunt. –It is understood that Hunt will be taken, in a short time, from Hertford gaol, and put on board one of the hulks lying off Woolwich, preparatory to his being transported for his natural life, by the first convict-ship, which will sail from this country to New South Wales. The augmentation of the army consists in the formation of two regiments, the 94th and 95th infantry, and in the intended raising of four others, but which will not be embodied for some time. If we look at the previous strength of the army of this extended Empire, the small increase in question will not only excite no alarm, but it will be considered absolutely necessary for ordinary purposes. The total number of regulars voted for the last year (exclusive of the East Indies) was only 71,000, including officers. These may be said to be distributed in the following manner :– Great Britain, 18,000 Ireland, 24,000 West Indies, 7,000 North America and Africa, 6,500 Gibraltar, Mediterranean, &c. 8,000 Cape of Good Hope, } Ceylon, } Mauritius, } New South Wales, }7,500 71,000  ID207 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1828 	05 	07 	entertain 	Love in a Prison. –We have all heard that Love rules the court, the camp, the grove but we have rarely heard that the little god delighted to dwell in prisoned solitude ; true it is and of verity, nevertheless, that he seems, if not to have fixed his dwelling in, at least to be a very constant visitor of, our jail. It is not long since a couple, who had imbided the tender passion, were linked in the bonds of matrimony in it ; and a like consumnation, most devoutly to be wished for by another pair of inmates, would ere now have taken place, did not envious bolts and bars intervene, for a petition has been presented by two delinquents of different sexes, both under sentence of transportation, to the Magistrates, praying that they may be allowed to marry before setting out for New South Wales. The fond pair never saw each other till inclosed in the same vehicle on their way to stand trial at last Perth Circuit, for capital offences ; yet, in this situation, love–omnipotent love–took the captives captive, and rendered them in its enjoyment, even in their perilous plight, o'er a' the ills o' life victorious. But, alas! the course of true love never did run smooth; and no less a personage than the Secretary of State for the Home Department has in this case crossed the path of the hapless couple, and doomed them to single blessedness for many a year, by ordering the fair penitent to be removed to Penitentiary at Millbank for seven years, instead of transportation for fourteen ; leaving the forlorn lover to seek consolation in the charms of some sterling or currency damsel in the land of promise, to which he must now wend his solitary way.– Fife Hld.  ID223 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1831 	02 	05 	inform 	The Machine Breakers. –A convict ship at Portsmouth is on the point of sailing for Van Diemen's Land, with between two and three hundred convicts on board, who have been lately convicted for machinebreaking, extorting money, and other offences committed in the disturbed counties. Another ship, with convicts of the same description, will be dispatched for New South Wales, in about a fortnight. These convicts have been kept entirely separate from all other prisoners, and an accurate report will be made to the Governors of the Colonies, as to their former character, their trades and employments, and the recommendations which have been made in their favour subsequently to their trials. The capital convicts whose lives have been spared, are to be transported for life; and the convicts, sentenced and recommended by the Judges for transportation, are to be transported according to their respective sentences.  ID230 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1833 	08 	03 	inform 	On Tuesday thirty-one male convicts were embarked at Leith for the hulks in the Thames, preparatory to their transhipment for New South Wales, except those in whose cases a commutation of punishment may take place.  ID248 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1835 	07 	08 	inform 	A new principle has been recognised in the regulations attendant upon the transportation of convicts from this country to New South Wales. Boys of six and girls of ten years will be allowed to accompany their parents to that distant colony.  ID275 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1839 	04 	10 	inform 	The Wesleyan Mission Ship. –The Committee of this Society have purchased a vessel, to be employed exclusively under their direction in conveying missionaries and stores between the colonies of New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, the Friendly Islands, the Fejees, and other groups and islands of the Great South Pacific Ocean.
