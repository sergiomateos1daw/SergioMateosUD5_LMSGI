Slegg, arrived in the Downs, which are dated the 10th of June : they contain an account of all the merchant ships which were then at that island ; that they were nearly full, and were fixed to sail from thence the 26th of July and the first of August ; and that the weather continued exceedingly fine.  ID33 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	12 	11 	inform 	Extract of a letter from a gentleman in America to his friend in Greenock . No doubt, Sir, you have been expecting this some time a remittance in money for your goods; but as part of them is still on hand, I could not properly answer you in cash or bills ; however, if you will accept of wheat in return, it shall be immediately sent you ; for our wheat crop has been so plentiful that we can supply you with many thousand bolls of an eceeding fine quality ; and to my knowledge there are several ships loading for your market at present.  ID36 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	12 	14 	inform 	Orders are sent to Plymouth for the Echo sloop of war, Capt. Drew, lately arrived from Newfoundland, and now lying in the Sound, to get ready for sea, and proceed with all possible dispatch to New York–to acquaint the American Merchants, that the British ports are open for the importation of American wheat :–It is to be hoped this salutary measure will reduce the present high price of wheat and flour.  ID38 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	12 	14 	inform 	This day arrived a mail from New-York, brought to Falmouth, by the Sandwich packet, in thirty-three days.  ID43 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	12 	18 	inform 	This morning arrives a mail from Jamaica, which was brought over in his Majesty's packet the Roebuck, after a passage of 54 days.  ID82 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	11 	29 	inform 	Extract of a letter from Dublin, Nov. 23. The drafts at Cork yesterday received the agreeable orders to return to their respective regiments immediately. The officers appointed to raise independent companies in Ireland, have received orders to repair forthwith to England, with whatever complement of men already entered, but not to proceed with the completion of their number : in conference to this order, they are preparing for their immediate departure. Last Tuesday two eminent merchants of this city received orders, by way of a vessel arrived at Cork, from Mess de Fouseca Olivarez and Co. at Seville, for the immediate exportation of cotton, white linen, and mixed goods, to a very large amount. Monday evening the Elizabeth and Mary, Mark Purcell, master, arrived at Waterford from Annapolis, in Maryland, after a long and dangerous passage, of 52 days, in which they had nearly exhausted the whole of their provisions, having been a very short allowance of half a naggin of rum, diluted with one pint of bad water, for twenty-four hours. She is heavy laden, having on board six hundread hogsheads of tobacco, a large quantity of pipe staves, barrel hoops, &c. and has been expected more than two months. Eight per cent was offered as insurance on ship and cargo, but refused, on account of the then probability of a war.  ID144 	Aberdeen Journal 	Aberdeen 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1819 	06 	02 	inform 	Colonial Intelligence Advices have been received again from the Cape of Good Hope of 6th March, which are several days later than those acquired formerly. Of the rising of the Caffres there remains no doubt, although it does not appear that Government have as yet received official information regarding it. The private accounts state that two valuable officers had lost their lives, and also a great number of men. The Governor himself in order by his presence the sooner to suppress the Caffres, had, with a competent force, proceeded to the interior. Great inconvenience was experienced for the want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not this been the case, it was believed that in a very few days tranquility would have been restored. We are sorry to state that another hurricane has taken place in the Isle of France ; it commenced on the 25th January, and has done great mischief to the shipping, and also to the plantations of that ill-fated Island. A Dutch mail has arrived, with papers to the 19th inst. At Batavia, two of the leaders of the late disturbances have been tried and execute, and that degree of tranquility which terror produces has been restored. In the administration of their colonies in the east, the conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and oppressive ; and it is to be regretted that the extensive and fertile island of Java should have been surrendered to their rapacity. During the short time that it was in possession of this country, various important improvements were introduced into its domestic administration ; the practise of torture, according to the humane and enlightened maxims of British jurisprudence, was abolished ; new and better modes of collecting the revenue were adopted ; and a spirit of mildness and of regard for the interests of all the various classes of which the population is composed, was evinced, which made the British Government highly popular. Considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants for the safety of the Queen Charlotte, Jamaica packet. She sailed from Jamaica the 29th March, and had a great quantity of specie on board. No things have since been received of her. Several vessels sailed since her departure, and have arrived safe. The Ocean quitted Jamaica on the 6th of April, and arrived here several days since. Several passengers landed at Portsmouth on Thursday from Jamaica, bring Port Royal Papers to the 25th of March. The 50th Regiment had arrived at Kingston, from Cork ; and the 2nd West India Regiment was about to embark for Sierra Leone to be disbanded.  ID165 	Glasgow Herald 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1820 	05 	22 	inform 	Extract of a letter received from Calcutta, dated 22d November, 1819:--An afflicting circumstance has recently taken place. The Captain of the Bengal, a Liverpool trader, very lately gave a ball on board his ship, which was about to sail for England. The party was very small, and more than half were taken ill with a violent fever immediately afterwards. I buried the Captain and the Surgeon a few days after it; not less than ten of the part died within as many days, all younger persons. Only one officer survives of those who left England in the ship, and he is just recovering in the Hospital. All sorts of conjectures were made, but it turns out that there were 17,000 undressed buffalo horns in the hold, in a complete state of putrefaction. This vessel has sailed for England in this state without a Surgeon. I question whether it will ever arrive; it ought not to be admitted among other shipping if it does;–the opening of the hold will be death to him who does it, and perhaps to many more.--In consequence of this disastrous information, Ministers have issued an order for the vessel, on her arrival at Liverpool, or any other part, to undergo quarantine.– London Paper. All apprehension on the above subject is completely done away by the following letter from Liverpool, May 14:– I noticed a paragraph in the London papers, respecting the Bengal, of this port, at Calcutta, stating that a number of deaths had taken place, supposed in consequence of the Infectious vapours arising from some buffalo horns.–The Bengal arrived here April 5, and has been discharged without any of those dreadful consequences which the medical gentlemen of Calcutta prognosticated.–I should rather suppose that the fatal consequences which ensued to those individuals who attended the ball given on board this vessel at Calcutta, would be none justly attributed to the exposure to night air.  ID169 	Aberdeen Journal 	Aberdeen 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1820 	07 	12 	inform 	Maritime Intelligence The Jane, Drummond, of Liverpool arrived at Savannah, was plundered on the 22d April in [?], 34, 10. long. 41. 21. of all her specie, 20,500 dollars, stores, provisions, &c. by a Spanish ship, of 300 tons, armed with 14 guns and two stern chasers, and full of men. She was supposed to have been out two or three months from Cuba. She had a yellow waist, woman head, painted black, and was coppered to light water mark. Intelligence from Marseilles, dated 22d inst. states –' An English Captain, who left Oran on the 13th inst. and arrived yesterday in this port, has declared that a squadron of five armed ships, which he was assured were destined for the North Seas, sailed from Algiers at the beginning of the present month. A vessel, the Prompt sailed on Tuesday evening from Greenock for Quebec, having on board emigrants from Anderston, Rutherglen, Lesmahogow, and Lanark, to the number of about 350 persons. The Rev. Mr Easton, of Montreal, goes out with the Prompt. The Hibernia, M'Eachren, from the Clyde to Buenos Ayres, was totally lost the 15th April, near Maldonado. Crew saved. Discovery of a New Island off Cape Horn A new island has been discovered off Cape Horn, in inst. 61 deg. long. 55 deg. by the ship William, on a voyage from Monte Video for Valparaiso. The same having been dispatched by Captain Sheriff, of the Andromache frigate, to survey the coast, had explored it for 200 miles. The captain went ashore found it covered with snow, and uninhabited. Abundance of seals an whales were found in its neighbourhood. He has named the island New Shetland. Accounts from Constantinople, dated May 26, annouce, that the armaments against Ali Pacha are upon the most formidable scale, and are actively pursued.– The latter has obtained hostages of his principal officers, as pledges of their fidelity. On the 14th, two new ships of the line were launched in the presence of the Sultan and his Grand Dignitaries, at the hour fixed by the chief astrologers. The navigation between Bagdad[?] and Bassurah has been free since the defeat of the Arabs by the English. The latter, it is stated, have facilitated the intercourse between those two places by the establishment of parket-boats.  ID188 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1822 	10 	19 	inform 	On Monday 14 instant, the ship Andromeda of London, James Muddle, master, sailed from Leith Roads for New South Wales, with 67 passengers, all of whom are very respectable people. The vessel has on board a full cargo of merchandise, and a great number of agricultural implements.  ID213 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1829 	07 	25 	inform 	Swan River. –The fine ship Gilmore, purchased by Mr T. Peel, brother to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, proceeded down the river on Saturday, on her voyage to Swan River. The Gilmore quitted the St Catherine Docks in the course of Friday, having on board an excellent assortment of every requisite which may be required to form the new settlement. Mr Thomas Peel has had the Gilmore, which is of 500 tons burthen, under his own inspection, as well as the selection of the agricultural and other implements to convey to the Swan River. There were many passengers on board. Mr Peel and his family, it is understood will join the vessel at Plymouth. In the vessel there are also going out other settlers. The Hooghly, another ship of 500 tons burthen, chartered by the same individual, is not yet quite ready for her voyage. Among the valuables sent out to Swan River are some fine race-horses, intended for breeding in the settlement, from whence India will be supplied, should the settlement answer.– Sunday Times.  ID218 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1830 	11 	10 	inform 	Messrs Marshall have made a most interesting addition to their beautiful Panorama of Botany Bay, Algiers, &c. of several Views illustrative of the principal events of the late Revolution in Paris, and from the brilliant and effective style in which they are got up, must draw the attention of the Public in no ordinary manner.  ID220 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1831 	06 	04 	inform 	The brig Stirling Castle, Captain Fraser, sailed from Greenock on Wednesday morning, for Sidney, New South Wales, having on board the Rev. J. D. Lang, minister of the Scots Church, in Sydney, and two other Presbyterian Ministers ordained to new stations in that colony ; also three Professors, intended for which a liberal Government grant has been obtained. There are also on board above 40 respectable mechanics with their families, consisting chiefly of joiners, masons, and others required for the building of the College, and a good many of whom are fromthis town, making the number of passengers in all about 140, of whom above 20 and cabin passengers.  ID224 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1832 	03 	03 	inform 	Leith Extensive preparations are already begun amongst e[?] shipping, for the various Spring voyages to distant ports[?]. Six vessels are advertised for America, one for Van Dieman's Land and New South Wales, and the whalers[?] are unfurling their canvass, and will sail for the [?] regions on Monday or Tuesday first. The departure of these ships will give the docks a naked appearance, the more apparent from the few foreign vessels present here.  ID230 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1833 	08 	03 	inform 	On Tuesday thirty-one male convicts were embarked at Leith for the hulks in the Thames, preparatory to their transhipment for New South Wales, except those in whose cases a commutation of punishment may take place.  ID238 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1834 	06 	18 	inform 	The ship, Numa, Captain Day, sailed from Leith road, yesterday forenoon with a full cargo of goods, and 37 passengers, for Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales.  ID244 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1834 	09 	24 	inform 	The St Nicholas, Morgan, which has arrived off Aberdeen from Bathurst, New South Wales, reports that timber was very scarce ; that the woods between that town and Miramichi were on fire ; that 250 tons of cut timber had been burnt, and the people in the woods had been obliged to abandon their camps and fly to save their lives. The thermometer at Bathurst was from 85 to 90.  ID269 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1837 	07 	09 	inform 	Highland Emigrants. –The ship Midlothian has just been fitted up at Leith for the reception of Highland emigrants, which she is to take in at the Isle of Skye for Sydney, New South Wales. These emigrants are, we believw, to be carried out at a very small cost to themselves, the largest portion of the passage money being paid by Government out of the land revenue of New South Wales, which is exclusively appropriated towards the encouragement and promotion of emigration–the objects in view being, as well the relief of those districts in this country which are suffering from the want of employment and subsistence, as by the introduction into that colony of a body of well disposed and virtuous free emigrant families and individuals, the promotion of the moral welfare of the colonists generally. The emigrants will, we believe, receive employment in New South Wales as farm-servants, shepherds, overseers, &c. We had a brief inspection of the Midlothian on Monday afternoon, and found it to be a very fine vessel, fitted up in a manner the most comfortable and convenient that could well be effected. She sails this afternoon from Leith to the Isle of Skye.  ID277 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1839 	05 	11 	inform 	New Zealand. –A vessel selected to carry out emigrants to New Zealand, under the auspices of a company formed in this country, will sail in about a fortnight. She is called the Tory, and measures about 480 tons. A dejeuner was given on Saturday by the proprietors on board, in the West India Docks, at which Lord Durham, Lord Petre, Sir G. Sinclair and several other distinguished persons were present. She is a fine vessel, well armed, and ample preparations have been made for the voyage. The company have purchased 600,000 acres of land from the native chiefs.  ID279 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1839 	07 	10 	inform 	The ship St Mungo, Captain Robert Smith Orr, sailed from Leith Roads on Thursday forenoon last, bound to Port Philip and Sydney, New South Wales, having on board fifty-eight passengers, chiefly settlers for the former of these settlements.  ID287 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1839 	09 	28 	inform 	Leith Thursday afternoon the splendid ship Indus, which has been some time in the docks, sailed with a full cargo and about sixty settlers, for Port Adelaide and Philip, South Australia. The Indus has been fitted up in that style of elegance and comfort, for which the agents, Messrs Broadfoot and Son, are so celebrated. The passengers consist of a number of respectable individuals of various professions, the greater bulk of whom are agricultural labourers, sent out by Messrs Adamson and Co., agents for her Majesty's Commissioners in South Australia. On Wednesday forenoon a man fell from the deck of the Royal William steam-ship, and had his thighbone broken, and was otherwise seriously bruised. He was carried to the Dispensary Rooms, but upon examining the nature of his injuries, the medical attendants recommended his removal to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.  ID294 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1840 	08 	15 	inform 	Emigration. –There are at present at the port of London alone no fewer than twenty-three vessels on the berth taking in goods and passengers for Sydney, New South Wales ; eight for Hobart Town and Lan[?]ceston ; four for Port-Philip, and give for South Australia ; being a greater number of emigrant ships for the southern hemisphere on the berth at one time than was every previously known.  ID304 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1841 	11 	17 	inform 	Wellington, New Zealand, June 18.– ( From a private letter. )–Among the latest arrivals is Mr Swainson, F.R.S., the eminent naturalist, by the Jane, from London. He has purchased a house, and intends to reside here with his family. The Governor, Captain Hobson, is daily expected from Auckland on a visit to Colonel Wakefield, the company's agent. Several emigrant ships have lately reached us. The Katherine Stewart, Forbes, from London, has just entered the harbour.  ID326 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	09 	20 	entertain 	New York, August 4. On Monday the 12th ult. there was a violent tempest at Leominster, Massachusetts, attended with hail which was of such a size, and fell with such velocity, that the stoutest Indian corn was beaten into shreds–vast quantities of apples were beaten from the trees–not only the fruit but the trees received great injury, the bark being broken from their limbs; the windows broken in the house, and the fences renewed such impressions, as to be discovered at 90 yards distance. Many of the hailstones were as large as hens eggs–the common size was a little more than an inch in diameter. Twenty-give hours after it fell, banks of it were measured at the foot of a hill, and found to be 20 inches deep. The Saturday following great damage was ??? by hail at Shrewsbury, country of Worcesster. August 15. On Sunday the 25th July, a violent hail storm commenced a few miles to the westward of Wilmington, Delaware, which did great damage to many fields of grain, and blew down, in many places, an immense quantity of timber. The hail in this storm was of an extraordinary appearance; part of it being about two inches long, and of a very considerable circumference. On Saturday, the 1st inst. arrived at Wilmington, Delaware, the brig Maria, Capt. fort, from Londonderry, with 200 passengers. On the 4th inst. arrived at Philadelphia, the Happy Return, Capt. Ewing, in 8 weeks from Londonderry, brought 340 passengers in good health: Capt. Ewing parted, near the Capes of Delaware, with the ship Sally, Capt. Miller, with passengers from Londonderry for that port also. Pennsylvania, July 21. Last Sunday evening Mr. John Garrison, son of William Garrison, of Newbury township, in this county, was killed by lightning in his own house. The lightning struck in at the gable and just at the instant that Mr. Garrison was in the centre of the floor, walking towards the window; his brother was standing within two yards of him when he fell, but providentially received not the smallest hurt. We also learn, that Patrick M'Sherry, of Little's-town, in this county, had two cows killed by lightning, the same evening. New London, July 30. A slight shock of an earthquake was fel tin this and the neighhbouring towns, on Sunday morning last, about thirty minutes past five o'clock. Middletown, July 25. About five o'clock this morning, a noise was heard that seemed to pass over this city, which is thought to have come from a north-westerly direction and proceeded to a south-easterly one. The noise was equal to loud heavy thunder, and the commotion occasioned by it very sensible in the shaking of houses, but no damage was done.– The Tuesday preceding, about six or seven miles to the southward of this place, a similar but heavier noise was heard, attended with the like commotion. Extract of a letter from Dartmouth, (Connecticut) July 26. Some days ago a house near the college, was struck by lightning, and a child therein killed. Since that a woman was killed by the same means in Cornish, a town adjoining Dartmouth, as she sat in her house at work. Later still at Hampton, in New York state, a yoke of oxen were killed, both by one flash of lightning.–From what reason we cannot tell, but the lightning has been peculiarly destructive in many of our settle ments during the present summer. It would aphowever, that nature is willing to repair those losses; accounts having just come to hand, that on last Monday morning a woman in FPlainfield was safely delivered of four girls at a???; one of whom died the night following, the rest likely to do well. Saturday, at a tavern near the market, the following specimen of gormandising was??? ed :–A person, not for any bet, or without any other inducement, than the craving of the stomach,eat, at one meal, a shoulder of roast lamb, 3 slices of bacon, three quarters of a pound of cheese, 15 large cucumbers, one half of an 8d wheat loaf, a plate of cold potatoes, and drank a quarter of cider.  ID330 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	01 	07 	entertain 	New-York Oct. 11. We are informed that the census of Philadelphia is completed, and that the city is found to contain fifty three thousand inhabitants. A Petersburgh (Virginia) paper of the 30th ult. informs the public of that state, that a serious petition is now drawing up, to be presented to the next congress, stating arguments in favour of polygamy, from the plain principles of reason; and praying that a man may legally marry two wives. This, it is thought, will be the most effectual means to extirpate the numerous race of old maids, and increase the population of the United States. The petition is to be presented by a gentleman residing at Cabin Point. Oct 12. In one of the Charleston papers of the 16th ult. appears the epistle from the yearly meeting of the Quakers in London, to the friends in Great Britain, Ireland and America. It is remarkable that in the re-publication of this episstle in the Carolina paper, the whole paragraph relative to theslave trade and negro slavery is omitted. Oct. 13. The ship Betsy, Rook, arrived on the 6th instant, at Wilmington, Delaware,, from Londonderry, in Ireland. This vessel brought in a large number of Irish emigrants, some of them people of property; who, weary of the patronage of their old tutelar saint, St. Patrick, have come to settle themselves and their posterity in America, under the more liberal auspices of St. Tammany. The following letter was written from a young heir to the Probate Judge–Sir–My father departed this life not long hence, and has left a widow and five scorpions. I understand he died deetested and made me executioner, but as the estate is like to prove insolent, I was told that as you was Judge of reprobates, you must send me a letter of condemnation. And as in duty bound ??? ??? pray, &c. Extract of a letter from a gentleman, in the county of Lincoln, Massachusets, dated Sept. 14. We have had a very wet season here since you went from us, and the grass hoppers are innumerable; they have eat up all the gardens, and all the grass; of course, as the natural consequences, we have no milk, neither shall we have any beef or butter this season; the corn has also suffered very much from those insects Extract of a letter from Banbury (Georgia) Sept. 20 A firm peace being now, to all appearance, secured between the United States and the Creek Indians, we may reasonable expect that the state of Georgia will soon begin to feel the good effects. The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value, and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men, who instead of being mere lookers on, in quality of overseers and drivers, would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe, and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw, is one of the most beautiful you can imagine,abounding with everything that can make life comfortable, besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of Sapola, with rather more water than that of Charleston. Several vessels are hourly looked for from France, (one in particular of 800 tons from Bourdeaux) to load with live oak ship timber and??? in the river of St. Mary's. Extract of a letter from Hampton (Virginia) Sept. 25. There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river, the exportations of which, in the opinion of rational men, ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals, and clays for the several colours of paint, which may be had in any quantity, and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal, from every discovery we have been able to make, are inexhaustible; all the samples, however, that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface, and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand, there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe, and at a much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints, there are none better in the world, and in quantity, when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river, of property and enterprize, are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature, it is thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their attention. Extract of a letter from Charleston, Sept. 27. On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard, Hubcaw, a fine new brig, calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice, the property of Mr. Hary Grant, and is to be called the Pringle. A number of spectators collected from the city to view the pleasing sight, with which they were no less delighted, than with the liberal en tertainment and polite attention of Mr. O???. Boston, Sept. 28. Yesterday sailed from this port, the ship Columbia, Capt. Robert Gray, on a circum navigation voyage to the North-West coast of America.–This is the second voyage the Columbia has made to our coast–too much praise cannot be given to the gentlemen, owners of the ship, for their exertion in extending the commerce of America. The native of??? has returned to the place of its nativity. Dr. FRANKLIN Never declare yourself the author of a???, without being, beyond doubt, certain of???, was the Doctor's advice. He generally enforced his percepts by giving an example. I had been with a number of my acquaintance taking the diversion of a dance at an inn. The fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the tavern keeper came in and advised us in a very warm manner to make a collection for the fiddler who had been scraping his cat gut several hours in our service; we apparently agreed, and he well pleased with the success of his persuasion, went for his hat to collect what we were willing to give. We took up an old newspaper, tore it into small pieces, which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern keeper goes round the room, and we, very gravely, drop our paper in his hat. The fiddler returns, and the landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self approbation, boasts of what he had been doing for him; It was I persuaded them to make the collection, I made them give, I went round to every one, and see what I have got. If it had not been for me–the fiddler examines his prize, and discovers the cheat–he vents all his anger upon the poor landlord's shoulders, who thus suffered for proclaiming himself the author of a project before its success was fully ascertained.  ID334 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	01 	10 	inform 	From the New York Journal. Winchester, Oct. 20. By recent intelligence from Kentucky we learn that a short time ago an American vessel was seized at New Orleans, and her cargo disposed of by the Spaniards. Also, that the troop which went out against the Indians had, not far from the banks of the Ohio, fallen in with about forty of them, whom they made their prisoners, after a slight resistance; and that having washed them, 15 turned out to be white men. Philadelphia, Nov 9. We hear from undoubted authority, that a considerable loan has been negotiated in Holland for the service of these United States. Albany, Nov. 4. The Legislature of Vermont have resolved to pay to the State of New York 30,000 dollars, agreeably to the first proposition contained in the declaration of the Commissioners of this State, appointed to declare the consent of the Legislature thereof, that a certain territory within the jurisdiction of the State of New York be erected into a new State on the 17th of October last; in consequnece whereof, all rights and titles to lands within the State of Vermont, under grants of the late colony of New York, or from the State of New York (except such grants as were intended as confirmations of those from New Hampshire) cease and determine. The Legislature have also resolved, that a Convention be called for taking into consideration the constitution of the United States; the members to be elected in December, and the Convention to Meet the first week in Jauary. The Legislature have adjourned to meet again on the first Thursday in January, for the purpose (we suppose) of choosing Senators, and affixing the time and manner of electing Representatives for Congress. New York, Nov. 18. The following resolution has passed the House of Representatives of the State of Virginia now in session: Resolved, That so much of this act, entitled, An Act, making provision for the provision for the debt of the United States in their redemption of the public debt, is dangerous to the rights, and subversive of the interest of the people; and demands the marked disapprobation of the General Assembly. Portland, Nov. 15. The stone work of the light house, at the entrance of our harbour, is now completed. On Tuesday the 9th instant, the last stone was laid by Mr. Nichols, of this town, master builder. The work is extremely well executed. The lighthouse is now 70 feet high. To this the lanthorn, which is to be six feet in diameter, will add about 15 feet, 85 feet in whole. The lanthorn is now preparing, and will probably be raised and lighted by the first of next month. Baltimore, Nov. 23. A society of respectable gentlemen of this place have raised an adequate fund for the establishment of an extensive manufacture of gunpowder, and the necessary mill-works will be speedily erected in the vicinity of this town. This important insituation will not only prove highly advantageous to this State and town, but may, if properly encouraged, become a national benefit. York (Pennsylvania), Nov 10. From Wright's Ferry we learn, that about four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, as a boat was coming from the East side, a most tremendous storm arose when she was about half way over, by which means she was soon filled with water, and sunk. there was six passengers and the??? in her (besides a small light waggon and three horses, viz. a clergyman, the owner of the waggon, with his wife and three children; when the storm came on, the woman and children took shelter in the waggon, but it continued to blow with such violence that the waggon was torn out of the boat, and the body having by chance got loose from the carriage, and being pretty tight, floated some distance till its progress was stopped by a rock; the husband, viewing the melancholy situations of his wife and children, resolved to relieve or perish with them, and quitting the boat swam to the waggon, cut open the cover with his knife, and with difficulty kept their heads above water till they were relieved by a boat from the West side; by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappeared; the Clergyman just as he found the boat sinking mounted his horse, one of the boatmen mounted on one of the waggon horses, and by this means preserved themselves till they were relieved by a boat; the other boatman of the name of Tim Sulivan, depending on his skill in swimming got up an oar, but it is thought he is drowned, as he has not since been heard of; the boat was found in the falls, and one of the waggon horses that had been given up for lost, was found next day some distance below the falls, with all his geers on, and does not appear to have received the least injury. Extract of a letter from Sunbury, Northumberland County (Pennsylvania), dated Nov. 13. One of the men who murdered the Indians at Pine Creek, was tried on Saturday evening, and though a number of witnesses clearly proved the hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed, and the confession of his counsel at the bar that confirmed it, yet, notwithstanding an express charge from the judges to bring him in guilty, the jury in a few moments returned with a verdict in his favour, and a subscription to pay the costs of the suit, that he might be immediately set at liberty; and all this from a most absurd idea, which the Attorney General, with all his endeavours, could not beat out of them, that the crime was not the same to kill an Indian as a white man: for some minuets the Chief Justice was mute with astonishment. How the State can pacify the Indians now, Heaven knows, while at this moment the other murderers are at large in this country, and no one will arrest them.  ID341 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	02 	22 	inform 	From the Jamaica Royal Gazette. Kingston, Nov. 28. By late arrivals from Hispaniola we learn, that the people are in quietness, but still armed; and that the Governor, who had been suffered to remain, but the Intendent only having fled, is perfectly submissive to the will of the people. For several days last week the weather at the north side, and in some of the Liguanea Mountains blew in most alarming gusts, and the cold is said to have been peculiarly sever; some plantain trees have been thrown down, but we have yet heard of no material damage. The sloop Resolution has brought into port a part of his Majesty's 10th regiment of foot, consisting of a serjeant, and 29 privates, having received them from on board the ship Commerce, Foot, from London, off the East End on Thursday last, the Commerce being destined for Savanna la Mar. Dec. 26. Late on Thursday evening his Majesty's ship Amphion, Captain Nichols, returned to Port-Royal from the Spanish American coast. The Amphion was bound to Carthagena, but was prevented by the jealousy of the Spaniards from entering that port. Accounts are said to be received by her that a revolt has taken place amongst the Indians in that quarter, and that the Spaniards are demolishing the fortifications throughout the country, which it has cost them so much labour and expence to raise; so appre hensive are they of the numbers and force of the malcontents, should they possess themselves of any of those strong holds. We learn from Georgia, that the treaty with the Indians, to negotiate with Commissioners were appointed by the President of the United States, has been broken off; and that Mr. M'Gillivray and his warriors have declared, that nothing short of a cession of the territory between the rivers St. Mary and Altamaha will satisfy them; adding, that no equivalent can be given to the Georgians for relinquishing their claim to the district in question, as it is founded in usurpation. The views of Mr. M'Gillivray in making this requisition are evident, as it is known that he wishes to establish a sea-port at St Mary's, as well for thecommercial emolument, as for the civilization of his countrymen, by an intercourse with foreign States.  ID344 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	05 	17 	inform 	Kingston, Feb. 6. By a St. Christopher's paper of the 25th ult. we learn, that the small-pox raged lately at >Surinam, to such a degree that, within the space of two months, upwards of 2500 persons had perished by that disorder. A very severe shock of an earthquake was felt between give and six on the evening of last Thursday se'ennight, at the settlements near the Blue Mountains. On Wednesday the 3d instant, arrived at Lucca, the ship Pitt, Captain Hunter, from Africa with154 Gold-Coast Negroes. On the passage from Africa, nine of the seamen mutined, whom Captain Hunter has brought confined in irons, and they are to be tried at a Court of Admiralty Sessions. Feb. 20. Very strong suspicions are entertained by the Americans, that the Indian Chief M' Gilveray, and the nations under his immediate controul, or in alliance with him, are subsidied by the King of Spain. It is a well known fact, that they are regularly supplied with cloathing, arms and ammunition, from the Royal Magazines at St. Augustine and Pensacola, and therefore in all probability; the sword not the olive branch, will be the most speedy and effectual agent for terminating the disputes. March 6. Tuesday last arrived in the harbour of Port Royal, from Cork, his Majesty's ship Chichester, of 44 guns, armed en flute, Lieutenant Craven, Commander, having on board the first battalion of the first or Royal Regiment of of foot, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Dundas. The other Officers are–Captains, Duncan, Franer, Pemberton, and Mannoch; Lieutenants, Sir W. Jas. Cockburne, Bart. Nicholson, Puxley, Clunes, Browne, Clarke, Drummond, and Graham; Adjutant, Sir. W. J. Cockburne, Bart. Quartermaster, Mr. Davidson, Surgeon, MR. Young; Ma?e, Mr. Bolton. The troops in the Chicester amount to 500 men, exch??e of 100 women and children. Colonel Hunter is appointed superintendent of the settlement at the Bay of Honduras, in the room of Colonel Despard, recalled. Col. Hunter came out with the earl of Effingham; it is therefore probable that the disputes which have so long subsisted between Lieutenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of the Bay of Honoduras, will be brought to a speedy determination. At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's estate,a negro blacksmith was sold for the extraordinary sum of two hundred and sixty pounds! At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d regiment quitted the barracks in this town and at Up Park Camp, and embarked on board the Chichester for Great Britain; the 14th at the same time taking possession of their quarters. Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispaniola, that, on the 1st of this month, a number of free people of colour, to the amount of 700 and upwards, having possessed themselves of several field pieces, formed a camp in that districh, and exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarming. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent from the Assembly to demand the reason of so extraordinary a proceeding, the insurgents demanded, that a remonstrance which they then delivered to the deputies, should be presented imimmediately to the general, and that an answer thereto should be given without delay. The paper being conveyed as they desired, proved to be a sensible and well written detail of the various claims the free people of colour had on what they termed the justice of the whites, with whom they demanded an equal participation of all rights and immunities whatsoever–the privilege of representation, and of qualifying for all the learned professions–and concluding with the avowal of a determination to proceed to extremities should their demands be treat with neglect. On the perusal of this paper, it was judged adviseable to assemble a body of the militia, who headed by the General, immediately went against the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired and fled to the mountains; three or four of the whites were killed, and one of the ringleaders was taken and instantly beheaded. A proclamation was then issued, offering a reward of 50 half joes for the head of any principal offender, and in the course of a few days not less than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday the 7th instant, a very great majority of those who had formed the camp, finding all their attempts completely frustrated, came in and took the oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two of the principals, for whom high rewards are offered, are not yet taken. From Port Maria we have received the disagreeable account of the loss of the ship Lion, Capt. Smith, belonging to Liverpool: a violent breeze on the 5th instant drove her from her anchors, and she now lies stranded on the beach.  ID349 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	07 	25 	entertain 	Norfolk, April 11. This day arrived the ship Albion, John Simmons, master, in 47 days from Rotterdam; on the 8th lying to in a heavy gale of wind, the Albion shipped a sea, which carried away all her boats and every loose article from the deck; there were three men of the watch, one of whom is washed overboard and perished– his name is John M'Naught, and belonged to Greenock. Extract of a letter from a gentleman at the falls of the Ohio, to his relation inWinchester, Virginia. dated April 13, 1791. I wrote to you from Fort Pitt, which place we left the 3d. inst. in company with two other boats, and proceeded to Limestone, without meeting or apprehending danger–at that place we were informed of several disasters which had befallen boats going down the river, and one to a boat going up to a French station, loaded with bacon, butter, &c. The particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians, and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing, they gave the Indian whoop, and rushing on the flankets, scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat, but did no damage, as it required some time to make their way into the river. After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity, they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days, five or six boats happened to come down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them, in which were two young ladies, of the name Macdonald, a young gentleman, and some others, passengers, and took it. Elevated with this easy capture, they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight, which they attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes, each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat, as it came down, and commenced firing; after discharging their guns, they retreated, loading and came on a second time, fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on, there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat, which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two were killed, and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat, and prevent the Indians from boarding it, which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ???, they threw billets of wood at them, and one of them took up an ax, as a weapon of defence, should they persist in boarding, which the Indians perceiving, and, as is supposed, their ammunition being expended, they retreated, without accomplishing their object. These inhuman monsters, previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat, placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes, in which situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction, they fired at another boat, and killed one young man. In short, every boat tat has gone down the river lately, has been fired at, except our's. We saw no Indians; the places where the above depredation happened we passed in the night. Boston, May 4. It is supposed that the adventures of the town of Boston, lost 25,000 dollars in the late lottery; besides 'wear and tear' of conscience. Salem, May 31. His excellency our worthy overnor perceiving, with his usual discernment, that Lotteries have a tendency to withdraw the people's attention from industry, the only certain source of wealth and prosperity; and also that they operate as a??? ??? ???, ??? ??? and embarrassed being??? the ??? a venturers; suggests, in??? ??? the Legislature, the propriety of discontinuing this mode of raising money. The states of Connecticut and New Hampshire have passed laws, prohibiting the sale of lottery tickets of other states, in their states. Bennington, May 30. A gentleman from the northward informs, that the part at the British post lately holden in this state, has recently been recalled. Baltimore, May 27. Colonel Jacob Webb, and Captain Miller, formerly of Stamford, in Concecticut, Mr. John Carmel, of Philadelphia, merchant, and several other gentlemen, with a negro boy, were drowned, on the 9th of March last, in St. Mary's river (Georgia) occasioned by the oversetting of a boat, in a sudden flaw of wind. Boston, May 25. On Friday last, the venerable Mr. John Simonds, of Salem, entered the one hundredth year of his age. He is the only male person who has arrived at that great age from the first settlement of the town by the English, in 1629, to the present day. New York, June 9. General Washington, on his tour to the Southern Sates, landed at Charlestown, South Carolina, in a barge decorated for the purpose, with colours and pendants, and rowed by twelve American Captains and a Cockswain, all dressed in blue silk jackets, black silk breeches, white stockings, and blue roses to their shoes. They had likewife hold laced hats; with silk bandeaus, with the motto, Long live the President. An immense number of people assembled near the Quay, and on board the vessels in the river, which, as well as works, saluted him with several discharges of artillery. The day was afterwards devoted to conviviality–The lodge of St. John addressed his Excellency as follows:– Right Worshipful Sir, We the Master, Officers and Members of St. John's Lodge, No. 2 of Newbern, beg leave to hail you welcome with three times three ! We approach you not with the language works have proved you to be the true and faithful Brother, the skilful and expert Craftsmen, the just and upright Man. But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to express with sufficient energy, the cordial warmth with which our bosoms glow towards you–We therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and devoutly pray, that the Providence of the Most High, may strengthen, establish and protect you in your walk through life–and when you are called off from your terrestrial labours, by command of our divine grand master, and your operations sealed with the mark of his approbation, may your soul be everlastingly refreshed with the streams of living water which flow from the right hand of God. And when the Supreme Architect of all world's shall collect his most precious jewels, as ornaments of the Celestial Jerusalem–may you eternally shine among those of the brightest lustre. To which the President returned the following answer:– Gentlemen, I receive the cordial welcome which you are pleased to give me, with sincere gratitude. My best ambition having aimed at the unbiassed approbation of my fellow citizens, it is peculiarly pleasing to find my conduct so affectionately approved,, by a fraternity whose association is founded on justice and benevolence. In reciprocating the kind wishes contained in your address, be persuaded, that I offer a sincere prayer for your present and future happiness. George-Town. April 30. Yesterday morning, about one or two o'clock, the ship Termagant, belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen, lying in the stream opposite this town, was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected, but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board, the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction, and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting, store and dwelling houses, on the water side, were prevented from sharing a similar fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse, the property of Francis and Charles Loundes, situated at some distance from the water, wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stored, was several times, in different places, on fire, ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss, occasioned by this alarming element, must be great indeed, as the ship was large and nearly new; besides, there were goods to a considerable amount, and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the money, which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin, which by some means or other, set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost. Pittsburgh, May 21. A letter received in this town, on Sunday last, from Lieut. Jeffers, at Fort Franklin, mentions, that an Indian had arrived there, who brought him intelligence that 300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations had set out for war and that they were determined to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio, near Petersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing, but their destination was not known.  ID377 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1794 	07 	18 	inform 	Philadelphia, June 3. [ Authentic.] Copy of a letter from General Wilkins, to Col. C. Biddl, dated Pittsburgh, 23 d May, 1794. I this moment received yours of the 17th inst. I arrived about fifteen minutes ago from Le Boeuf, and left the detachment there well covered, and in good spirits. They have built, under my directions, two small block-houses, picketed in, which I think will render them sufficiently strong until the reinforcement goes under Capt. Denny. The Indians I have conversed with still continue of the opinion that the British will make an opposition to the establishment at Presque Isle. There arrived at Cuslawago, while I was there, an Indian from Sandusky, where he had been left by the Senecas last fall sick;ߝhe says the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, M'Kee, and Elliot the Indian agent, (the two last refugees from this country) were visiting all the Indian towns in that quarter, and exciting them to continue their opposition to the Americans, and assuring them of support from their father the British monarch. He further adds that they were ready for fighting Gen. Wayne the moment he moved; and that the British were erecting garrisons at the Miami river. Heconfirms the accounts of the other Indians, that they were determined to oppose the establishment at Presque Isle. There were in the Port of Philadelphia on the 25th of May. 62 Ships, 73 Brigs, 7 Snows, 60 Schooners, 42 Sloops. 244 In the House of Representatives of the United States, Thursday June 5, 1794. The House, according to the order of the day, resolved itself into a committee of the whole House, on the report of the Committee, to whom was referred the remonstrance of the People west of the Alleghany Mountains, relative to the navigation of the river Mississippi, and after some time spent therein, Mr. Speaker resumed the chair, and Mr. Trumbull reported, that the Committee, according to order, had the same report under consideration, and come to a resolution thereupon, which he delivered in at the Clerk's table, where the same was twice read, and agreed to by the House, as follows: Resolved, That as it appear, from the communications of the Executive, that the right of the United States to the free navigation of the Mississippi, is now the subject of negotiation with the Court of Spain; and as it is the interest of the United States, and every part thereof, to come to an amicable adjustment of the right in that mode, rather than resort to any means constitutionally belonging to the Legislature, no farther proceeding should be had on the said remonstrance, during the present session of Congress. Extract from the Journal.  ID393 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	09 	25 	inform 	On Tuesday se'enight, arrived in the Bay of Aberdeen,the Mehitabel and Mary of Portsmouth, from New Hampshire, United States, [???]ate master, with an assorted cargo, [???]n gentleman in that place, and next [???] Leith, where she arrived on Mon[day.
