If these accounts should prove true, I think the President will as good reason for recommending to Congress, at the next session, the abolition of the army, as he had at the last, for doing away the naval forces on the lakes– because it was more likely to involve us in war, than to give us security and peace. A little while ago we made quite a bluster and noise because the King of Spain had imprisoned one of our citizens at Cadiz; but the nation seems to rest very easy at present with the above named executions. Why?–because the wrong is committed by us, not against us. Extract of a letter, dated Washington city, June 2. 1818:– The British Consul-General, A. St. John Baker, is about to depart for Europe; the ostensible cause of his departure is the recovery of his health, but it is sufficient to look in his face to see that it is only a common diplomatic disease, which may be aggravated or cured at discretion ; the real object is diplomatic ; the English Cabinet has expressed some hesitation in regard to certain subjects in Mr Bagot's dispatches ; the speculation carrying on between the Spanish agents and some persons in this place opens a field of corruption so wide and comprehensive. Mr Baker goes prepared to state the facts, from his immediate knowledge ; for no man is better acquainted with men and things here.– The Chevalier Colonel Sarmiento is also preparing to visit Madrid, but his business appears to relate to mercantile affairs of some Americans on the west coast ; he received 27,000 dollars for one service of this king, but the object for which he received the douceur failed, and he will not refund. Treasury Department. Washington, May 25, 1818. SIR–The act of Congress, concerning navigation, hereto annexed, which is to take effect the first day of October next, so materially changes the commerce of the United States with the colonies and territories of Britannic Majesty, thata due regard to the convenience and interest of those engaged in it requires that the construction of the act should at this time be determined. According to the term used un ther the first section of the act, every port or place in the British colonies and territories in the West Indies, and on the continent of America, must be considered as closed against vessels of the United States, to which they are not by act of Parliament permitted to carry on the same trade, both in exports and imports, which is now, or shall be, carried on in British vessels between the ports of the United States and the ports of any British colony or territory. The permissions by act of Parliament to vessels of the United States to go in ballast to Turk's Island, and bring away salt, or to carry certain articles to one or more of the Bahama Islands, and bring away salt, and a few other articles, cannot be considered as opening the ports of those islands to the vessels of the United States, according to the intention of the act of Congress, whilst British vessels are permitted to carry on the same trade in articles prohibited to vessels of the United States. It may be proper to observe, that the prohibition in the first section applies equally to vessels whether in ballast or with cargoes. The form of the bond required by the second section of the act is hereunto annexed. It is expected that proper circumspection will be exercised in requiring a security, as much of the efficacy of the act will depend upon the judicious discharge of this part of your duty. I am, very respectfully, Sir, your most obedient servant, Wm. H. Crawford. Collector of the Port of Alexandria, D.C. From the Philadelphia Gazette. Extract of a Letter, dated Laguira, May 11.

We have the official news here from Caraccas, that another battle had been fought on the 11th instant, about 20 leagues west from San Carlos, in which both parties seem to have fought with desperation. The Spaniards say that the Patriots are totally defeated, but acknowledge the loss of many first rate officers.
