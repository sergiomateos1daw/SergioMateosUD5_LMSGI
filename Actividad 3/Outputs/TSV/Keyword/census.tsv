England. Scotland. Ireland. Total. To North American colonies, 5,303 3,053 23,935 32,293 United States, 35,309 1,246 4,087 40,0 Other parts of America, 44 – – 44 West Indies, 745 687 159 1,591 The Cape, 315 8 – 323 Australia and New Zealand, 14,495 817 538 15,850 56,213 5,811 28,719 90,743 We have not the previous Returns at hand, but we believe that a larger number of emigrants never left the shores of the British Isles in one year than the above. It is startling to think, that 1800 persons quit the kingom every week never to return. The natural increase of the people must be about 1100 per day, of whom emigration carries off 250, leaving 850 to swell the Census. The emigration to our North American colonies was as follows:– To Canada, 21,209 –New Brunswick, 8,056 – Newfoundland, 387 –Nova Scotia, 972 –Cape Breton, 437 Prince Edward's Island, 1,214 Hudson's Bay, 18 32,293 To Australia it was:– Swan River, 224 South Australia, 2,748 Port Philip, 3,473 Sydney, 7, Van Diemen's Land, 299 14,392  ID330 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	01 	07 	entertain 	New-York Oct. 11. We are informed that the census of Philadelphia is completed, and that the city is found to contain fifty three thousand inhabitants. A Petersburgh (Virginia) paper of the 30th ult. informs the public of that state, that a serious petition is now drawing up, to be presented to the next congress, stating arguments in favour of polygamy, from the plain principles of reason; and praying that a man may legally marry two wives. This, it is thought, will be the most effectual means to extirpate the numerous race of old maids, and increase the population of the United States. The petition is to be presented by a gentleman residing at Cabin Point. Oct 12. In one of the Charleston papers of the 16th ult. appears the epistle from the yearly meeting of the Quakers in London, to the friends in Great Britain, Ireland and America. It is remarkable that in the re-publication of this episstle in the Carolina paper, the whole paragraph relative to theslave trade and negro slavery is omitted. Oct. 13. The ship Betsy, Rook, arrived on the 6th instant, at Wilmington, Delaware,, from Londonderry, in Ireland. This vessel brought in a large number of Irish emigrants, some of them people of property; who, weary of the patronage of their old tutelar saint, St. Patrick, have come to settle themselves and their posterity in America, under the more liberal auspices of St. Tammany. The following letter was written from a young heir to the Probate Judge–Sir–My father departed this life not long hence, and has left a widow and five scorpions. I understand he died deetested and made me executioner, but as the estate is like to prove insolent, I was told that as you was Judge of reprobates, you must send me a letter of condemnation. And as in duty bound ??? ??? pray, &c. Extract of a letter from a gentleman, in the county of Lincoln, Massachusets, dated Sept. 14. We have had a very wet season here since you went from us, and the grass hoppers are innumerable; they have eat up all the gardens, and all the grass; of course, as the natural consequences, we have no milk, neither shall we have any beef or butter this season; the corn has also suffered very much from those insects Extract of a letter from Banbury (Georgia) Sept. 20 A firm peace being now, to all appearance, secured between the United States and the Creek Indians, we may reasonable expect that the state of Georgia will soon begin to feel the good effects. The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value, and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men, who instead of being mere lookers on, in quality of overseers and drivers, would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe, and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw, is one of the most beautiful you can imagine,abounding with everything that can make life comfortable, besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of Sapola, with rather more water than that of Charleston. Several vessels are hourly looked for from France, (one in particular of 800 tons from Bourdeaux) to load with live oak ship timber and??? in the river of St. Mary's. Extract of a letter from Hampton (Virginia) Sept. 25. There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river, the exportations of which, in the opinion of rational men, ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals, and clays for the several colours of paint, which may be had in any quantity, and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal, from every discovery we have been able to make, are inexhaustible; all the samples, however, that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface, and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand, there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe, and at a much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints, there are none better in the world, and in quantity, when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river, of property and enterprize, are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature, it is thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their attention. Extract of a letter from Charleston, Sept. 27. On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard, Hubcaw, a fine new brig, calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice, the property of Mr. Hary Grant, and is to be called the Pringle. A number of spectators collected from the city to view the pleasing sight, with which they were no less delighted, than with the liberal en tertainment and polite attention of Mr. O???. Boston, Sept. 28. Yesterday sailed from this port, the ship Columbia, Capt. Robert Gray, on a circum navigation voyage to the North-West coast of America.–This is the second voyage the Columbia has made to our coast–too much praise cannot be given to the gentlemen, owners of the ship, for their exertion in extending the commerce of America. The native of??? has returned to the place of its nativity. Dr. FRANKLIN Never declare yourself the author of a???, without being, beyond doubt, certain of???, was the Doctor's advice. He generally enforced his percepts by giving an example. I had been with a number of my acquaintance taking the diversion of a dance at an inn. The fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the tavern keeper came in and advised us in a very warm manner to make a collection for the fiddler who had been scraping his cat gut several hours in our service; we apparently agreed, and he well pleased with the success of his persuasion, went for his hat to collect what we were willing to give. We took up an old newspaper, tore it into small pieces, which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern keeper goes round the room, and we, very gravely, drop our paper in his hat. The fiddler returns, and the landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self approbation, boasts of what he had been doing for him; It was I persuaded them to make the collection, I made them give, I went round to every one, and see what I have got. If it had not been for me–the fiddler examines his prize, and discovers the cheat–he vents all his anger upon the poor landlord's shoulders, who thus suffered for proclaiming himself the author of a project before its success was fully ascertained.  ID335 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	05 	09 	inform 	Halifax, April 6. The late violent rains have done much damage in the country:–The bridge at Sackville is nearly torn down, and the Mill there is much injured: the Bridge at Nine Mills River is partly carried away; and the different roads and causeways are supposed to have suffered more than 2000l. will repair. Since the retreat of the f–eral troops, under General Harmar, the Miami Indians have committed unparalleled cruelties. A large body of them, on the 2d of February, attacked the settlements called Big Bottom, twenty miles from Harman, on the Muilsingam, which they entirely destroyed. Eleven men and two children were massacred, two escaped and three were taken prisoners. Boston. The amount of the value of theexports from the United States, for thirteen months, agreeable to an estimate made at the Office of the Treasury, in 20,000,000 dollars. The greatest apprehensions are entertained of an invasion from our savage neighbours; as accounts from Philadelphia state, that there has been a confederation of all the South West Indians to fall on our frontiers early in the spring. Similiar apprehensions have driven the inhabitants in the country of Marcetta, from their plantations into the city, where they do military duty. According to the late Census, the number of inhabitants in this commonwealth is 470,000. Philadelphia, April 7. Congress met here to-day and made a house, Articles of the Constitution, that were not liked by many of us, are altered much for the better– among other things, we were dissatisfied that not any notice was taken of Religion, as we wanted it expressly declared, that not any sect should ever be established in preference to another.–This is now done. In this part of the world we know not any thing of Toleration–all are equally free. It is said we have land for upwards of an hundred millions of people; we are yet about three, so that,for sometime we have have not any great cause to fight for territory.  ID97 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1794 	09 	12 	entertain 	The laws of the State of Pennsylvania, and that of Massachusetts, by which the punishment of death is abolished, in all cases except for wilful murder, are about to be adopted by the respective Legislatures of all the other States. The system of the great and merciful???caria, has taken place of the sanguinary Penal laws of England. The abolition of Negro slavery, which has taken shape in the five New England States of New Hampshire, Massachusets, Rhode island, Connecticut, and Vermont; in the Midland States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delawar; and in the Western State of Kentucky, for several years past is now extended, by act of Congress to the Southern States of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Maryland; and the emancipation of the remainder of that unfortunate race of men is to take place on or before the fifth of November, 1795. The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts has g???ed a part of the public lands to the emancipated Negroes of that State, in proportion to the numbers of the respective families, where the liberal and philanthropic mind is gratified, by seeing them erect villages cultivate farms, and form communities of civilized Societies. Before the Gentleman, who has favoured us with this Intelligence, left America, they had established a Lodge of Masonry; and he had the satisfaction of seeing them on a grand day, parade to Church in all the magnificence of the Order, where a sermon was preached, on the occasion, by one of their own colour. They have also endowed public schools, employed??? and erected places of Public Worship. The Officers, Non-commissioned Officers, and Soldiers, who served in the Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country, have at last received a reward, infinitely beyond their expectations, but every way corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic. Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress, this last Session, to each individual, who served throughout the war; and to the defendants of those who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature, and eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value, to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran, as has been the case of former grants, he is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money, at the present market price, from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land, and the rest in money,a s may be most agreeable to the receiver. The Mint of the United States, which was established two years since, has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles, half eagles, and quarter eagles. The first is exactly five and forty shillings, English money, or ten American coin. The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half, and quater, which makes the courie of exchange simple, and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive, that ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle. There is, besides, one more silver coin, which is called a Dime, and is the tenth part of a dollar. The copper coin is called a Cent, and is the tenth part of a Dime. Six of the ships of war, which were voted by Congress in November last, are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next, and will complete a fleet of??? hundred guns. The city of Washington, which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States, will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence, and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city, as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground near the banks of the Potamac, possessing a delightful water prospect, together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city. From the President's house to the Capitol, run two great pleasure parks or malls, which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac, and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol, as well as those of the President's house, are of the finest marble. The building of these superb edifices has been much retarded by the want of stone cutters, masons, bricklayers, carpenters, and blacksmiths, who at this time actually receive the enormous wages of ten shillings American currency per day. The district of Country at the back of North Carolina, reaching to the Mississippi, and covering a country six hundred miles long by three hundred broad, is next winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the Province of Maine, extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the river St. Croix, is expected to form a Seventeenth. The new cities build in America since her independence are Grenville, in the State of Georgia; Martenberg, the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia, the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and Nashville, in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville, Fairfield, and Lex ington, in the State of Kentucky; Washington, the Capital of the United States; Sunbury, in the State of Pennsylvania; Hudson, upon Husdon's River, and Cooper's Town, in the State of New York; Bennington, in the State of Vermont; and Paterson, in the State of New Jersey. All the towns burnt by the English in the was, have been rebuilt, and the old cities of Charlestown, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, have been extended to more than double the extent they had before the peace. The population of the United States, by the last Census in 1790, was more than double what it was in 1775, by which it appears, that America doubles her number of people every fifteen years. The emigrations from the different nations in Europe to that country, are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually. The increase of farms and villages has been so great as to people four new States, and to extend their Settlements from the Atlantic to the Ohio in the South, and from the Atlantic to the Lakes on the River St. Lawrence in the North.
