Our charity, therefore, if we have any of these articles to spare, must be first extended to our own Colonies ; and we cannot be surprised, particularly when we consider the present price of bread at home, that no assistance can be given at present, either to the French or Dutch. The crops in the island of Jamaica promise a most plentiful harvest, except to the eastward, which ahs generally been considered as the most productive part. By the Westmoreland, just arrived from Jamaica, we learn that the slaves have become mutinous to an alarming degree, ever since they were made acquainted with the intended abolition of the Slave Trade.  ID12 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	08 	24 	inform 	A letter from the Bay of Honduras, dated May 26, says, The Spaniards, who pay an annual visit to this settlement, to prevent en croachments, are destroying all the cultivated spots on shore, alleging that the settlers are prohibited by the convention from cultivation of any kind. This will prove a temporary misfortune to the woodcutters, by depriving them of the principal means of subsisting their negroes, and might be productive of mischief, were it not that the British Superintendant, Colonel Despar, with the assistance of the Calypso sloop of war, keeps the woodcutters in order. This may rise the price of mahogany at home, and certainly will raise provisions here.  ID25 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	11 	20 	inform 	We have been favoured by a friend with the following extract of a letter from Grenada, by the last West India Packet. A Mr. C– has just arrive here from Martinico, where he left the white inhabitants in arms. The negroes there had conceived an idea, that the Parliament of England had set the English negroes free ; where upon those on several of the most considerable estates assembled together to the amount of 4000, and retired to the mountains, declaring, they would no longer be slaves ; saying, that they had as good a right to be free, as the negroes in the English islands. What has been the event is unknown ; but some reports say that they had arms, and had resisted the military and the militia ; and that 400 had been taken and condemned to die. It is a little singular that such an alarming spirit of discontent should first make its appearance among the French negroes, if they are (as has been assented by several writers) so much more civilized, so much better treated, than those of the English islands. God knows what bloodshed may soon follow, from the mistaken humanity of some well meaning, but ill informed leaders among you.  ID40 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	12 	14 	inform 	Extract of a letter from Dominica, Sept. 6. This day week the most diabolical design that that ever was formed, was discovered in Martinico : It was an insurrection of the negroes, who were that night to have set fire to the large and beautiful town of St. Pierre ; while the white people were all in confusion, and striving to escape the flames, they were to be butchered indiscriminately, man woman, and child.–The combustibles were laid in upwards of 100 houses, consisting of hemp dipped in turpentine. The plot was not discovered till five o'clock in the evening, when a negro belonging to an old lady, stung with remorse on thinking that he must murder the woman who brought him up form a child, disclosed it to her. The Troops being thereupon assembled, 40 of the negroes were taken, armed with a hanger and a long knife, the insturments which were in a few hours to have put a period to the existence of upwards of 5000 people. All the inhabitants have been under arms ever since, as they are afraid the negroes will attemp to release the 40 who are in gaol.  ID58 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	12 	07 	entertain 	An American paper, printed in March last, contains an eulogism of the highest strain on a gentleman who had, from pure motives of religion and humanity, restored 75 blacks, his property, to that natural freedom which is the right of all mankind.  ID118 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1816 	07 	08 	inform 	Colonial Population. We lay before our readers the following extracts from the latest official returns of populattion ordered to be printed by the House of Commons, July 12. 1815. Governor Baines, of Dominica, reports, that on the 19th February 1811, there were on the island – Slaves . . . . . . 21,783 Whites . . . . . . 1,325 Free persons of colour . . 2,988 Governor Bentinck, of Demerare, states the population of this island to be – Slaves . . . . . . 71,180 Whites . . . . . . 2,871 Free coloured . . . . 2,980 In the island of New Providence, one of the Bahama islands, the population was, December 13. 1810 – Whites . . . . . . 1,720 Free Blacks . . . . . 565 Free coloured . . . . . 509 Black Slaves . . . . . 3,044 Coloured Slaves . . . . 146 Foreigners . . . . . 700 Grand Total . 6084 St Vincent island contains – Whites . . . . . . . 827 Free coloured . . . . 646 Slaves . . . . . . . 22,020 The Grenadines contain – Whites . . . . . . . 226 Free coloured . . . . . 76 Slaves . . . . . . . 2,000 Berumda contains – Slaves . . . . . . . 4,794 Whites . . . . . . . 4,755 Surinam contains – Whites . . 2,029 Free Coloured and Black 3,075 Slaves . . . 51,957 Curacoa contains – Whites . . 2,781 Free Coloured . . 2,161 Free Blacks . . 1,878 Slaves Coloured . . 690 Slaves Black . . 5,336 Grenada contains – Slaves . . . 29391 Whites . . 771 Free coloured . . 1,120 Martinique contains – Slaves . . 77,977 Whites . . . 9,206 Free Coloured . . 8,630 The births in this island in 1810 were – Whites . . . 71 Slaves . . 1,250 Free Coloured . . 80 Berbice contains – Whites . . . . 550 Coloured . . 240 Blacks . . . 25,169 The slave popultion of Barbadoes exceeds 69,000 ; that of Jamaica, 319,912 ; and of Antigua, in 1810, 30,568.  ID130 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1818 	12 	28 	persuade 	Our paper of Thursday last contained a general view of some of the most popular publications on the subject of emigration, and we shall now endeavour briefly to make an estimate of the good and evil which is likely to befall those who embark in this hazardous adventure. There is one important fact which we gather from all the accounts of America, whether written for the purpose of praise or censure, namely, that there is a great demand for labour, and that wages are high, and this effect is necessarily produced y the vast space of fertile and unoccupied territory which lies westward of the United States towards the Pacific Ocean. It is this vacant territory which is the true spring of this American community. Here is the grand outlet for the superflouous population both of the eastern states of America and of Europe. To cultivate this waste there is a constant demand for new labourers ; wages are, of course, high – the labourer lives in comfort, and, if he is industrious, he becomes in his turn a purchaser of land from the savings which he accumulates. If labour should become more plentiful, and wages should fall, this is the signal for new emigrations ; and thus, this constant demand for labour in the western districts regulates its general price throughout the United States. In these circumstrances it is clear that a labourer, provided he can reach this advantageous market for his labour, will unquestionably improve his condition. But herein lies the difficulty. A labourer has seldom the means of of subsistence so far beforehand as to enable him to undertake so long a journey ; and, if he enters upon the enterprise with insufficient means, he is liable to starve before he can transport himself to his ultimate destination, or he is forced to contract, for immediate subsistence, obligations little short of servitude, under the weight of which he is grievously oppressed. These, then form strong objections to emigrations in the case of those who are stinted to their means ; but where these objections can be surmounted, those who can transport their labour from the overstocked market of Europe to the understocked market of America, will unquestionably dispose of it to better advantage ; but if they have not the means, they may as furely fail in the attempt, and draw upon themselves aggravated misery and want. As to the consequences of emigration to this country, we hold them rather to be beneficial than otherwise, and we cannot easily account for the very absurd alarm which has been propagated on this subject. The evil in Europe is, that every country is overcrowded with labourers, who cannot find employment ; and is it not manifest, therefore, that the withdrawing of some of these will make more room for the labourers that remain – that the loss of those useless hands will rather be a relief to the body politic, and will diffuse greater soundness and vigour through all its parts? That these effects will follow from emigration in this or in any other country in Europe we cannot doubt – and that the labourer, if he can afford the expence of the journey, will receive higher wages in America than in this country, is equally clear. There is another class of adventurers who may possibly improve their circumstances by emigration, although this is not so certain, namely, farmers with a moderate capital. An allotment of land may be purchased in the back parts of America at the Government price of two dollars per acre, and an emigrant who can afford to but and to cultivate 100 or 200 acres, and acts with proper judgement and skill, may undoubtedly, by a speculation of this sort, be sure of a subsistence, while, by the continued emigrations from the eastern states, the country being quickly settled all around him, his property is daily improving in value. But a want of judgement in the purchase, or a want of ability to cultivate the land after it is purchased, may involve him in irrecoverable distress and ruin ; and to avoid these hazards no little discrimination and prudence is necessary. Such are some of the most striking advantages of emigration, and we shall now state some of its disadvantages. The first, and chief of these, is the difficulty of effecting a settlement, and of subsisting until the land which is purchased yields its first produce. The country is partly open ground, or prairie, as it is called, or it is covered with almost boundless forests. A settlement in the woods requires incredible labour to clear it – labour is dear, and not easily procured, and this herculean task naturally devolves on the head of the family, who is forced during the day to ply the axe in this laborious drudgery of felling trees, and afterwards to follow the chace for a meal to his family. Here he must frequently sleep out in the woods ; and his body, exhausted with his day's labour, is exposed to the cold dews of night ; under such unintermitted toil his health declines, and it is obvious that his family, deprived even for a single day of his exertions, must be reduced to the most deplorable straits. In many parts the country which is marked out for emigrants is extremely unhealthy, in particular the banks of all the navigable rivers, which afford the most eligible settlements both in point of fertility and situation, are exposed to the most fatal maladies. The same causes which produce fertility produce disease. The overflowing of the waters, from the autumnal and spring floods, fertilise the land in a most wonderful degree ; but the exhalations of these stagnant waters, under a burning sun, are as fatal to the health as the deposits which they leave are favourable to the soil. Hence the many minute directions which are given to all emigrants in regard to their health. In a letter contained in the Emigrant's Guide, we have the following advice to those who are descending the Ohio : If the weather becomes warm, guard well against the smell of bilge water. But if you must descend in the spring, go early – avoid all delay, and remember you are fleeing for your lives. I have seen the havoc, and I believed it not till then. Again it is observed, Let nothing tempt you to fish in warm weather, immediately on changing your climate. The effluvia of the shores is poison. To a European emigran the climate must be, of course, even more fatal ; and he either therefore lose his health, or he must be continually tormented with anxiously taking care of it, which makes it a question whether it is worth having on such terms. Such are the hardships through which, if he has strength to endure them, he at length emerges into ease and independence. These hardships, however, will no doubt be in a great measure avoided, or at least mitigated, if he has beforehand provided the means of subsistence until he can derive regular supplies from his own land. In this case he is less liable to be dislodged from his situation by the casualties to which all emigrants are necessarily exposed. – He is secured against the hardships of a first settlement, and is more certain of attaining the wished for object of ease and affluence – To a farmer, therefore, or a labourer, emigration presents a fair chance of a permanent settlement, provided it is gone about with ordinary caution, and the necessary degree of energy be exerted to insure success. But it is a gross delusion to imagine that an elysium is to be found in the United States, or that mankind exist there on any more favourable terms than in this country, and those who set out on any such visionary schemes are sure to meet with a woeful disappointment. With regard to other classes of society, it does not appear that they will improve their condition by emigration to America ; there is no demand for clerks or professional men of any sort, and no merchant has any thing to expect by removing his capital to the United States. In the back settlements there is a demand for schoolmasters to teach the ordinary branches of education, and several emigrants of this class have met with good encouragement. In regard to the essential article of comfort, it is apparent, from all the best information on the subject, that a person long resident in this country would change for the worse by an emigration to the United States. He would, in the first place, suffer extremely from the climate, from the extreme cold of winter and the raging heat of summer, the thermometer frequently standing at 98 degrees in the share, with a clear sky and broiling sun, and very little abatement of this exsessive heat being experienced through the night. His frame, accustomed to the more temperate, though unsettled climate of this country, runs the risk of being debilitated by the change, and at all events he must suffer extremely in his enjoyments and in his spirit from this cause. Nor, we should imagine, would the manners of the people in the back parts be found very agreeable or polished. It is admitted on all hands, both by those who are favourable and those who are unfavourable to the Americans, that if there is not, as in Europe, gross ignorance and debasement on the one hand, neither is there on the other any thing much exalted above the ordinary level. But the inferences which arise from this established fact are strongly in favour of Europe. The grossness of vice and ignorance carries a sure antidote to its corruptions in the disgust which it excites : such examples are not so potent to debase, as examples of a different sort are to purify and exalt. There is little risk that society will be contaminated by what is low and debased ; but on the other hand, there is a certainty that what is exalted and illustrious in literature, science, taste, accomplishments, or fashion, will exercise a powerful influence on the general state of manners. We naturally copy what we admire, and those great and shining examples constitute a standard to which the whole system of life and manners has a tacit reference. In the United States they have no such models – they do not aim at so high a standard, and taste and manners are therefore necessarily at a lower ebb than in Europe – Hence all accounts agree in reprobating the extreme filthy habits which universally prevail ; and Cobbett, who will be suspected of too great partiality to this country, draws a contrast between the inhabitants of Hampshire and those of the United States, in which he places this vice of the American manners in strong colours ; and he adds, as his reason for this, that they have no gentlemen's seats, with the fine improvements of pleasure grounds, &c. dispersed through the country, as models of taste and neatness for the inferior classes, and it is to the same principles that we may trace other defects in their manners, namely, that they have no proper models on which to form themselves. Hence, excepting in the principal cities, we may safely conclude, from all the information we have received on the subject, that society has not reach the same degree of refinement as in this country. An emigrant accustomed to live in Britain would also feel the disavantages of American society strong in this, that here, in so closely peopled a community, surrounded with all sorts of refinements, life is assisted by such a variety of helps, that it glides down the smooth stream of comfort and convenience, without ever meeting with a single interruption. It is astonishing to what a pitch of improvement a society is brough, abounding in wealth and in all the mechanical arts, and where the ingenuity of thousands is incessantly on the rack to set on foot new devices for the common good. We are not duly sensible of the advantages of this, because, like other advantages, they are familiar to us by long habit, and we begin to imagine that they are inherent in the natural constitution of things. But when we are suddenly transplanted into a new community, abounding indeed in subsistence, but deficient in all comforts – where only the coarsest mechanic arts are practised – where the inhabitants are so widely dispersed, that their common exertions cannot be made available for the common good, we find life interrupted at every turn. In our former society, if we had not the previous secret of transmuting all things into gold, we had at least the power of transmuting gold into every thing else. But here the power of money is limited. We must indeed pay for services, but we must also beg for them ; and thus we go on fretting and tormenting ourselves under petty incommodities, which in this country would be remedied as soon as they were felt. It is incon ceivable how much inconvenience and discomfort and real unhappiness may spring from this cause. In this country, by long habit and pracrice and continual improvement, every thing has fallen into its right place – each individual has a separate task assigned him in the joint task of labouring for the general benefit – and the industry of all, however variously directed, tends to one common end. There is a perfect unity of effort. We all labour in common – we combine our efforts that they may yield the largest possible produce, and this produce is accurately shared among the various members of the community, each receiving the share to which his labour entitles him. Such is substantially the process by which commerce diffuses the benefits of industry over every civilized community. – Money is the instrument by which this division is effected. Every one who labours has the value of his labour ascertained in money, which is a draft upon the common stock for whatever quantity of necessaries and luxuries he is entitled to ; and all these complicated operations are executed with a regularity almost mechanical. But in a community newly forming there is a want of unity and combination – all the members labour indeed, but no one has his proper part assigned him – there is a jostling and an interference with each other – and when they come to divide, some have too much, and some too little, of certain articles – the stock is ill assorted, and money will not execute its functions. Hence disorder arises, and inconvience and awkward wants, and an individual suddenly removed into this region of discomfort from the happier climate of a highly improved community, must be annoyed with feeling in the highest degree gloomy and disagreeable. He must have the same sensation as a person who quits an elegant mansion, fitted up with every comfort and convenience, for one of inferior quality and coarsely finished, where he is exposed to a thousand annoyances every minute. It is observed by Dr Johnson, that the evil of life does not consist in any sudden and overwhelming crash of misery, but in a series of petty discomforts amd mischiefs continually preying upon the temper. The truth of this maxim, those who emigrate from this country to the back woods of America, will have a good opportunity of verifying. The prevalence of slavery in most of the States of the Union constitutes another capital defect in the structure of American society. These slaves form a degraded and oppressed class, and, in the tyranny exercised over them, they themselves are morally destroyed, while the corruption extends to the other orders of society, equally infecting the oppressed and the oppressor, and debasing the general character and habits of the people. It is vain to talk of liberty while stain of tyranny so deeply infects the domestic manners of a community. There can be no rational liberty unless we call that liberty which gives us the privilege of torturing and oppressing our fellow creatures. To give an idea of the consequences of this dreadful evil of slavery, we may state, that it is a practice in Kentucky to commit delinquent slaves into the hands of the public executioner, by whom they are unmercifully flogged at the markey cross of the different towns, the streets being filled with their pietous cries. What can we think of the people where such spectacles are for a moment tolerated. This is so utterly revolting to every just and enlightened feeling, that to a European it would form a strong objection to his permanent residence in that country. In all the northern states, and in some of the new states, particularly that of the Ohio, slavery is indeed abolished. But in several others the black form a large proportion of the population, and they are not decreasing. We know indeed that this evil is admitted in its full extent by all the American statesmen, that they lament it, but do not well see what measures can be adopted to check it. The importation of new slaves is indeed prohibited, but the increase of those already in the country is the great grievance, against which it is difficult to devise a remedy, and the cruel and oppressive treatment which slaves will always meet with wherever they exist, must tend to degrade the habits and moral feelings of the community at large. To such, therefore, as are accustomed to European society, where no such strain of tyranny infects the domestic manners, an exchange into a community where his feelings may be revolted by spectacles of gross cruelty cannot be regarded as very desirable. If more imperious considerations permit, they have certainly a greater chance for happiness by remaining where the rights of nature are respected, than by removing to a society where every principle of humanity is trampled upon.  ID134 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1819 	01 	02 	persuade 	In answer to the remarks which appeared in our paper on Monday last, respecting emigration to America, and to the statements there given of the disadvantages which emigrants from this country might expect to meet with, we have received a very abusive letter from an anonymous correspondent, who appears very angry, and, like most other angry men, seems more anxious to give full vent to his wrath than to assign any good reason for it. His first cause of quarrel is, that we have stated the general want of cleanliness to be a prevailing defect in the back parts of the United States. For this we have the authority of almost every traveller who has visited those parts. The remarks of Birkbeck on this point are conclu-sive and striking: – ' In viewing the Americans (he observes) and ' sketching, in a rude manner, as I pass along, ' their striking characteristics, I have seen a de' formity so general, that I cannot help esteem' ing it national, though I know it admits of ve' ry many individual exceptions. I have written ' it, and then erased it, wishing to pass it by, ' but it wont do – it is the truth, and to the truth ' I must adhere. Cleanliness in houses, and too ' often in person, is neglected to a degree which ' is very revolting to an Englishman. ' America was bred in a cabin ; this is not a ' reproach – for the origin is most honourable ; ' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn ' logs for a framed building, and that again for ' a mansion of brick, some of her cabin habits ' have been unconsciously retained. Many have ' already been quitted, and one by one they will ' all be cleared away, as I am told they are now ' in the cities of the eastern states. ' There are, I believe, court-houses, which ' are also made us of as places of worship, in ' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating ' ever since they were built. What reverence ' can be felt for the majesty of religion, or of ' the laws, in such styles of abomination ? The ' people who are content to assemble in them ' can scarcely respect each other. Here is a bad ' public example. It is said that to clean those ' places is the office of no one. But why is no ' person appointed ? Might it not be inferred ' that a disregard to the decencies of life prevails ' through such a community?' To the same purpose Cobbett complains of the ' general (for there are many exceptions) sloven' liness about the homsteads, and particularly ' about the dwellings of labourers. Mr Birkbeck ' complains of this, and indeed what a contrast ' with the homesteads and cottages which he left ' behind him, near the exemplary spot, Guild' ford, in Surrey.' He then proceeds to give the reasons for this. When the first settlers took possession of the country, the ' example of neat' ness (he observes) was wanting. There were ' no gentlemn's gardens, kept as clean as ' drawing-rooms, with grass as even as a car' pet. From endeavouring to imitate perfec' tion men arrive at mediocrity ; and those who ' never have seen or heard of perfection in these ' matters, will naturally be slovens.' He afterwards remarks – ' The market day at Guildford is a perfect ' show of cleanliness. Not even a carter without ' even a clean smock-frock, and closely shaven ' and clean washed face. Well may Mr Birkbeck, ' who came from this very spot, think the people ' dirty in the western country. I'll engage he ' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one ' family of his present neighbours, than he left ' behind upon the skins of all the people in ' the three parishes of Guildford. However, he ' would not have found this to be the case in ' Pennsylvania, and especially in those parts where ' the Quakers abound ; and, I am told, that in ' the New England States, the people are as ' cleanly and as neat as they are in England. ' The sweetest flowers, when they become pu' trid, stink the most, and a nasty woman is the ' nastiest thing in nature.' In answer to all this, our correspondent tells us, that the Scotch are very dirty. This, we admit, was formerly, and may still continue in some degree to be, the reproach of the Scotch. But does this reasonable person mean to argue from this, that dirty habits are amiable, and ought not to be corrected. With regard to the difficulties of effecting a settlement, we are borne out in our remarks on this subject by the authority of various writers, and principally by the autheor of the Emigrant's Guide, a work of great merit, which combines an extent and precision of statistical information altogether unequally, with the most enlarged general views of the state of the country, both physical and moral. ' Most men (observes ' this judicious writer) on arriving in the United ' States, expects too much. Perhaps the only ' essential advantages offered are the security of ' person and property, and the cheapness of land. ' It demands excessive labour, severe economy, ' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident, to ' succeed in a newly settled country ; and it de' mands the permanency of this continued la' bour, prudence, and favourable circumstances.' Our anonymous correspondent is also extremely displeased that we have stated so strongly the perincious effects produced on the general manners of the Americans by the existence of slavery ; and he mentions that many a labourer in this country might envy the condition of an American slave. What are those privileges for which a free man should envy a slave he does not think proper to state. To show, however, that we have not exaggerated the degradation and oppression of the coloured class in the United States, we shall again adduce the authority of the Emigrant's Guide. The author is contradicting the notion that the labourer in the slave States is confounded with the negroe ; and he expresses himself in the following terms: – ' A residence of 16 years in places where sla' very is prevalent, enables us to contradict a ' general expression, that, in such places, whites, ' performing manual labour, are confounded in ' the moral estimates of the people with slaves. ' Though less respect is certainly paid to useful ' labour in the slave states than where all the ' duties are performed by whites, yet ' the distance between the two races of men are ' in all cases immense. So deep, profound, and ' inveterate is the feeling on that subject, that ' not any where in the United States can pro' perty, sobriety, intelligence, and every other ' advantage, expect colour, raise in public opi' nion a man the most remotely allied to the ' African, to a rank equal to the meanest white. ' Any person who resides a few years in Louisi' ana will be witness to some very remarkable ' exemplifications of this innate contempt for all ' those who affinity involve them in the con' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery.' What a picture is here conveyed of misery and degradation on the one hand, and of tyranny on the other. – Here we find it failry confessed that no degree of worth, whether moral or intel lectual, not even the possession of property, can give a man the least degree of consideration in the eyes of the privileged class. We cannot conceive a community more wretchedly constituted. All that is estimable and worthy is here utterly contemned, because the individual who possesses these qualities happens to have his skin of a particular colour, and thus a merely accidental quality of the corporeal frame entails upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy and contempt. These distinctions, carried to such an excess, seem to us to be founded on the extinction of every generous and honourable sentiment, and we cannot help still asserting that we had rather live we at present are, than in a community where such hateful antipathies rule to the exclusion of every just and humane feeling. With regard to the condition of the negroe slaves we shall quote a passage from Brown's Western Gazetteer or Emigrant's Directory after reading which, we shall leave our anonymous correspondent to say whether he thinks the condition of a labourer in this country preferable to that of being an African slave. The writer, describing the town of Lexington, in Kentucky, observes – ' In this square stands the market-house, ' which is of brick, and well furnished on Wed' nesdays and Saturdays ; but occasionally the ' scene of a barbarous practise ; for it is here ' that incorrigible or delinquent negroes are ' flogged unmercifully. I saw this punishment ' inflicted on two of these wretches. Their ' screams soon collected a numerous crowd ; I ' could not help saying to myself, These cries ' are the knell of Kentucky libery.' Having made this answer to the angry charges thus brought against us, we have only to disclaim, in the strongest terms, all hostility or prejudice against the Americans. We have no wish either to depreciate their character or institutions. They exhibit the interesting spectacle of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace to wealth and greatness. To revile such a people would be the height of human folly, and equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to take offence because endeavour to make a fair estimate of their character, without hiding any of its defects.  ID141 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1819 	05 	27 	inform 	Extract of a letter from William Hunt, esq. To H. Hunt, esq. Washington Hotel, New Orleans, Dec. 25. 1818. My Dear Brother – We arrived safe in the mouth of the Mississippi on the 10th of this month, after a voyage of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in excellent health, and very happy. There are 35 English vessels from Liverpool now here, and a great many English emigrants from Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Lancashire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Somersetshire ; and, in fact, from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a week in the river, about 80 miles below New Orleans ; we all went on shore, and had plenty of rabbit shooting. I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun, by Knock, corner of Fetter-lane. Henry, myself, and Mr Blake went one day into the woods to kill deer, by night coming on, we lost our road ; and, differing in opinions, we separated, Henry and Mr Blake taking one road, and myself the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods, and did not return to us till the next morning. It being wet, and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground, in spite of the remonstrances of Mr Blake, caught a severe cold, and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days, but he is now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In the river there are thousands of wild swans, wild geese, wild ducks, woodcocks, snipes, and other wild fowl. If you were there, you would kill a waggon load in a day, as I know you have frequently killed a horse load in England ; but they are a thousand times more numerous here than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms with them, and very cheap. No game certificate required here. Myself, Henry, Mr Blake, and the other passengers, visited a French farmer, about six miles below New Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land, whereon are sugar plantations, sugar-houses, & c. ; he made 250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter, as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. – They are very lazy, bad managers, and appear to use their negroes very cruel, and work them very hard. The Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer, as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the deaths are frequently seventy in a week. The scenery of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and Staines, and many of the buildings are as handsome as those of Bath. Here is one Church, which is a very beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spanish shops are all open, and it is a market during the whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening, gambling & c. We are at the Washington Hotel, the best in the city ; it is expensive, although very good living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each, including claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm weather as in England, and it is as warm here now as it was in England in July, although not half so oppressive and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the election : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel, most of them English. We do not trouble ourselves about politics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil, and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday we were charged 100 dollars each for passage, and four dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four quarters of the best peas, rye, grass seed, and some more of Hill's Scots ploughs, to be left at Messrs Brown and Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the Illinois. Mr Trimmer, an Englishman, has purchased 20,000 acres of land near Mr Birkbeck, and has taken twenty couple of hounds with him, so that we shall have some hunting as well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought over some with me, but they may follow us ; as I understand the labourers, with the pay of a dollar a day, can live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply, and others that I have seen from Illinois, report that the farmer can get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is a good sure market, and a fair profit and only one penny per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to pay. Price of labour is very dear here ; we pay a dollar for washing every dozen of shirts, cravats, pocket handkerchiefs, & c. & c. The price of a gallon of best rum is one and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things shipped from England, I have paid 92 dollars for. Although I should like England very well if it was not for the taxes, yet, from what I have seen hitherto, I like America ten times better  ID330 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	01 	07 	entertain 	New-York Oct. 11. We are informed that the census of Philadelphia is completed, and that the city is found to contain fifty three thousand inhabitants. A Petersburgh (Virginia) paper of the 30th ult. informs the public of that state, that a serious petition is now drawing up, to be presented to the next congress, stating arguments in favour of polygamy, from the plain principles of reason; and praying that a man may legally marry two wives. This, it is thought, will be the most effectual means to extirpate the numerous race of old maids, and increase the population of the United States. The petition is to be presented by a gentleman residing at Cabin Point. Oct 12. In one of the Charleston papers of the 16th ult. appears the epistle from the yearly meeting of the Quakers in London, to the friends in Great Britain, Ireland and America. It is remarkable that in the re-publication of this episstle in the Carolina paper, the whole paragraph relative to theslave trade and negro slavery is omitted. Oct. 13. The ship Betsy, Rook, arrived on the 6th instant, at Wilmington, Delaware,, from Londonderry, in Ireland. This vessel brought in a large number of Irish emigrants, some of them people of property; who, weary of the patronage of their old tutelar saint, St. Patrick, have come to settle themselves and their posterity in America, under the more liberal auspices of St. Tammany. The following letter was written from a young heir to the Probate Judge–Sir–My father departed this life not long hence, and has left a widow and five scorpions. I understand he died deetested and made me executioner, but as the estate is like to prove insolent, I was told that as you was Judge of reprobates, you must send me a letter of condemnation. And as in duty bound ??? ??? pray, &c. Extract of a letter from a gentleman, in the county of Lincoln, Massachusets, dated Sept. 14. We have had a very wet season here since you went from us, and the grass hoppers are innumerable; they have eat up all the gardens, and all the grass; of course, as the natural consequences, we have no milk, neither shall we have any beef or butter this season; the corn has also suffered very much from those insects Extract of a letter from Banbury (Georgia) Sept. 20 A firm peace being now, to all appearance, secured between the United States and the Creek Indians, we may reasonable expect that the state of Georgia will soon begin to feel the good effects. The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value, and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men, who instead of being mere lookers on, in quality of overseers and drivers, would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe, and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw, is one of the most beautiful you can imagine,abounding with everything that can make life comfortable, besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of Sapola, with rather more water than that of Charleston. Several vessels are hourly looked for from France, (one in particular of 800 tons from Bourdeaux) to load with live oak ship timber and??? in the river of St. Mary's. Extract of a letter from Hampton (Virginia) Sept. 25. There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river, the exportations of which, in the opinion of rational men, ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals, and clays for the several colours of paint, which may be had in any quantity, and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal, from every discovery we have been able to make, are inexhaustible; all the samples, however, that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface, and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand, there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe, and at a much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints, there are none better in the world, and in quantity, when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river, of property and enterprize, are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature, it is thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their attention. Extract of a letter from Charleston, Sept. 27. On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard, Hubcaw, a fine new brig, calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice, the property of Mr. Hary Grant, and is to be called the Pringle. A number of spectators collected from the city to view the pleasing sight, with which they were no less delighted, than with the liberal en tertainment and polite attention of Mr. O???. Boston, Sept. 28. Yesterday sailed from this port, the ship Columbia, Capt. Robert Gray, on a circum navigation voyage to the North-West coast of America.–This is the second voyage the Columbia has made to our coast–too much praise cannot be given to the gentlemen, owners of the ship, for their exertion in extending the commerce of America. The native of??? has returned to the place of its nativity. Dr. FRANKLIN Never declare yourself the author of a???, without being, beyond doubt, certain of???, was the Doctor's advice. He generally enforced his percepts by giving an example. I had been with a number of my acquaintance taking the diversion of a dance at an inn. The fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the tavern keeper came in and advised us in a very warm manner to make a collection for the fiddler who had been scraping his cat gut several hours in our service; we apparently agreed, and he well pleased with the success of his persuasion, went for his hat to collect what we were willing to give. We took up an old newspaper, tore it into small pieces, which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern keeper goes round the room, and we, very gravely, drop our paper in his hat. The fiddler returns, and the landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self approbation, boasts of what he had been doing for him; It was I persuaded them to make the collection, I made them give, I went round to every one, and see what I have got. If it had not been for me–the fiddler examines his prize, and discovers the cheat–he vents all his anger upon the poor landlord's shoulders, who thus suffered for proclaiming himself the author of a project before its success was fully ascertained.  ID97 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1794 	09 	12 	entertain 	The laws of the State of Pennsylvania, and that of Massachusetts, by which the punishment of death is abolished, in all cases except for wilful murder, are about to be adopted by the respective Legislatures of all the other States. The system of the great and merciful???caria, has taken place of the sanguinary Penal laws of England. The abolition of Negro slavery, which has taken shape in the five New England States of New Hampshire, Massachusets, Rhode island, Connecticut, and Vermont; in the Midland States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delawar; and in the Western State of Kentucky, for several years past is now extended, by act of Congress to the Southern States of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Maryland; and the emancipation of the remainder of that unfortunate race of men is to take place on or before the fifth of November, 1795. The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts has g???ed a part of the public lands to the emancipated Negroes of that State, in proportion to the numbers of the respective families, where the liberal and philanthropic mind is gratified, by seeing them erect villages cultivate farms, and form communities of civilized Societies. Before the Gentleman, who has favoured us with this Intelligence, left America, they had established a Lodge of Masonry; and he had the satisfaction of seeing them on a grand day, parade to Church in all the magnificence of the Order, where a sermon was preached, on the occasion, by one of their own colour. They have also endowed public schools, employed??? and erected places of Public Worship. The Officers, Non-commissioned Officers, and Soldiers, who served in the Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country, have at last received a reward, infinitely beyond their expectations, but every way corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic. Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress, this last Session, to each individual, who served throughout the war; and to the defendants of those who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature, and eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value, to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran, as has been the case of former grants, he is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money, at the present market price, from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land, and the rest in money,a s may be most agreeable to the receiver. The Mint of the United States, which was established two years since, has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles, half eagles, and quarter eagles. The first is exactly five and forty shillings, English money, or ten American coin. The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half, and quater, which makes the courie of exchange simple, and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive, that ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle. There is, besides, one more silver coin, which is called a Dime, and is the tenth part of a dollar. The copper coin is called a Cent, and is the tenth part of a Dime. Six of the ships of war, which were voted by Congress in November last, are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next, and will complete a fleet of??? hundred guns. The city of Washington, which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States, will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence, and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city, as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground near the banks of the Potamac, possessing a delightful water prospect, together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city. From the President's house to the Capitol, run two great pleasure parks or malls, which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac, and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol, as well as those of the President's house, are of the finest marble. The building of these superb edifices has been much retarded by the want of stone cutters, masons, bricklayers, carpenters, and blacksmiths, who at this time actually receive the enormous wages of ten shillings American currency per day. The district of Country at the back of North Carolina, reaching to the Mississippi, and covering a country six hundred miles long by three hundred broad, is next winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the Province of Maine, extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the river St. Croix, is expected to form a Seventeenth. The new cities build in America since her independence are Grenville, in the State of Georgia; Martenberg, the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia, the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and Nashville, in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville, Fairfield, and Lex ington, in the State of Kentucky; Washington, the Capital of the United States; Sunbury, in the State of Pennsylvania; Hudson, upon Husdon's River, and Cooper's Town, in the State of New York; Bennington, in the State of Vermont; and Paterson, in the State of New Jersey. All the towns burnt by the English in the was, have been rebuilt, and the old cities of Charlestown, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, have been extended to more than double the extent they had before the peace. The population of the United States, by the last Census in 1790, was more than double what it was in 1775, by which it appears, that America doubles her number of people every fifteen years. The emigrations from the different nations in Europe to that country, are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually. The increase of farms and villages has been so great as to people four new States, and to extend their Settlements from the Atlantic to the Ohio in the South, and from the Atlantic to the Lakes on the River St. Lawrence in the North.  ID344 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	05 	17 	inform 	Kingston, Feb. 6. By a St. Christopher's paper of the 25th ult. we learn, that the small-pox raged lately at >Surinam, to such a degree that, within the space of two months, upwards of 2500 persons had perished by that disorder. A very severe shock of an earthquake was felt between give and six on the evening of last Thursday se'ennight, at the settlements near the Blue Mountains. On Wednesday the 3d instant, arrived at Lucca, the ship Pitt, Captain Hunter, from Africa with154 Gold-Coast Negroes. On the passage from Africa, nine of the seamen mutined, whom Captain Hunter has brought confined in irons, and they are to be tried at a Court of Admiralty Sessions. Feb. 20. Very strong suspicions are entertained by the Americans, that the Indian Chief M' Gilveray, and the nations under his immediate controul, or in alliance with him, are subsidied by the King of Spain. It is a well known fact, that they are regularly supplied with cloathing, arms and ammunition, from the Royal Magazines at St. Augustine and Pensacola, and therefore in all probability; the sword not the olive branch, will be the most speedy and effectual agent for terminating the disputes. March 6. Tuesday last arrived in the harbour of Port Royal, from Cork, his Majesty's ship Chichester, of 44 guns, armed en flute, Lieutenant Craven, Commander, having on board the first battalion of the first or Royal Regiment of of foot, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Dundas. The other Officers are–Captains, Duncan, Franer, Pemberton, and Mannoch; Lieutenants, Sir W. Jas. Cockburne, Bart. Nicholson, Puxley, Clunes, Browne, Clarke, Drummond, and Graham; Adjutant, Sir. W. J. Cockburne, Bart. Quartermaster, Mr. Davidson, Surgeon, MR. Young; Ma?e, Mr. Bolton. The troops in the Chicester amount to 500 men, exch??e of 100 women and children. Colonel Hunter is appointed superintendent of the settlement at the Bay of Honduras, in the room of Colonel Despard, recalled. Col. Hunter came out with the earl of Effingham; it is therefore probable that the disputes which have so long subsisted between Lieutenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of the Bay of Honoduras, will be brought to a speedy determination. At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's estate,a negro blacksmith was sold for the extraordinary sum of two hundred and sixty pounds! At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d regiment quitted the barracks in this town and at Up Park Camp, and embarked on board the Chichester for Great Britain; the 14th at the same time taking possession of their quarters. Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispaniola, that, on the 1st of this month, a number of free people of colour, to the amount of 700 and upwards, having possessed themselves of several field pieces, formed a camp in that districh, and exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarming. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent from the Assembly to demand the reason of so extraordinary a proceeding, the insurgents demanded, that a remonstrance which they then delivered to the deputies, should be presented imimmediately to the general, and that an answer thereto should be given without delay. The paper being conveyed as they desired, proved to be a sensible and well written detail of the various claims the free people of colour had on what they termed the justice of the whites, with whom they demanded an equal participation of all rights and immunities whatsoever–the privilege of representation, and of qualifying for all the learned professions–and concluding with the avowal of a determination to proceed to extremities should their demands be treat with neglect. On the perusal of this paper, it was judged adviseable to assemble a body of the militia, who headed by the General, immediately went against the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired and fled to the mountains; three or four of the whites were killed, and one of the ringleaders was taken and instantly beheaded. A proclamation was then issued, offering a reward of 50 half joes for the head of any principal offender, and in the course of a few days not less than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday the 7th instant, a very great majority of those who had formed the camp, finding all their attempts completely frustrated, came in and took the oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two of the principals, for whom high rewards are offered, are not yet taken. From Port Maria we have received the disagreeable account of the loss of the ship Lion, Capt. Smith, belonging to Liverpool: a violent breeze on the 5th instant drove her from her anchors, and she now lies stranded on the beach.  ID345 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	05 	24 	entertain 	NOOTKA SOUND. The circumstances of thetrade and situation of this part of North America being a matter of such general conversation and great public moment, we are particularly happy in being enabled to give some further account of the transactions, that have happened at Nootka Sounds, as well as to point out the advantages that were likely to be extended to other places by the means of this trade. It is necessary to remark that the skin of the sea otter is worn only in the Northern regions of China. Its fur, though beautiful and magnificent, is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the Southern Provinces. Pekin is, therefore, the proper mart for this valuable commodity, and in this immense city, the consumption is so great, that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale. The Mandarins of the Court, and even the Emperor himself, are fond of wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank, a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury. The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds, that all the blankets, cloths, hats, and stockings, that could be procured in China, if English manufacture, were sold to the Indians, with whose Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed. An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to be recorded. The Spaniards discovering that Callicum, a Chief, second in authority at Nootka Sound, was in alliance with the English, he was shot through the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife of Callicum, with an infant child, escaped, but not till wounded. Macquilla, the Chief, first in command, retired at the head of the allies of England, from Nootka Sound, and to avoid the cruelty of the Spaniards, they fled to distant parts. Such of the natives as they could seize, the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications. At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands, with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. And we further add, on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration, that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain Mears, the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines. Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of Kamschatka, and other ports belonging to the Russians, with the teas and other produce of China. This promised to be an invaluable channel of commerce, as the Chinese have shut their ports against the Russians, who On this voyage of discovery and experiment, one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo, but was unfortunately lost on her return to China. To these curious particulars we add, with a patriot joy, that the consumption of the glorious staple of England, her broad cloths, is astonishingly great in Japan and China: British hard ware, &c. is also in great request. From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears, ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility. This Prince is six feet 4 1/2 inches high, of proportionate bulk.  ID367 	Glasgow Herald 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1822 	01 	28 	inform 	Extract of a letter from an Englishman, dated Lima, Septemper 10, 1821 Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colonial town; 6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; the whites are about 1200 Europeans, and not as many born in the country; the rest are blacks and mulattoes. Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty and misery than in any town of the size in the world.– There are some few splendid houses, but the rest so disgustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin. The streets, as in all American towns, run at right angles; a powerful stream of water in each; the town is capable of great improvement. The climate must be bad, for the whole population look as if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of Peru we made the same observation; the ague very general, with fever–their habits and manner of living increase the evil; thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold –I sleep under a heavy blanket, and could bear another; a thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter; the heat however is not excessive during summer; on the whole not an oppressive climate, if the people had any idea of living in a rational way. Very few families cook at home℃they buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets, in pulperias, and in the squares; not six families in Lima that have wine on their tables; they drink brandy at all hours, and excuse themselves for not having any thing that is expensive by saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies himself a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in the evening. Their money goes in gambling, debauchery, and dress; every woman, high and low, has her price; a lady takes no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you she is quite at good as her neighbours, and needs be no better. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause of all the degradation of South America; every Viceroy, from Pizarro to Pezuela, was a plunderer, a teacher of immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of this people seems incredible–one must see to believe it; scarcely a young lady can read or write, or use a needle; few houses that the Devil has not appeared in; and a devout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves; as to priestcraft, it reigns here in all its glory; a third part of Lima is covered with churches, some of them very splendid. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the single mine of the mountain of Pasco for returns; if this is worked to advantage, it will produce six millions of dollars; but if the country is disturbed by war, not a dollar will they have. The exports of Peru, in ordinary times, were five millions of dollars in pecie, and one million in produce. Mininng may be carried to any extent, it is true; but this requires tranquillity and good government. People in Europe have the most erroneous ideas or Peru; every traveller and historian who has written or talked about it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar. Arica, the second port of Peru, and the great outlet to Upper Peru, is a wretched village of hovels covered with mud–about 400 Mulattoes and Indians–placed on a sand bank–the people all in the ague–not a boat or ship of any sort. The harbour-master came off on bulsa, (two bladders lashed together,) paddled by an Indian. We could not get a basket of fruit or vegetablse for money. Their cultuvation was three leagues off, but they were too lazy to fetch any thing, though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to twnety hours, offering them any price for their tropical fruits. I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month, and sleep on the ground; borrowed a chair, and bought some crockery. No such thing as a tavern; never was. Letters of no use; no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at eight o'clock to kill time. A play twice a week; the most fashionable ladies stand up in the front boxes, and light a segar by the chandelier; the house filled with smoke. There are 82 titled families, mostly idiots–all reduced to poverty by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war be continued a year, Peru will be the most wretched country on the globe; indeed the Indians will regain their empire, and exterminate all other colours. the number of blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy thousand– 25,000 in Lima and adjacent village, the total population of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians. About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty country houses. Provisions of all sorts excellent, and in the greatest variety; fruits of all climates in the marketplace, the produce of the sea-shore and the Cordillera.– Beef and mutton excellent–the chief supplies come from Janja and other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore produce is continued to little vallies badly cultivated; those about the town would disgrace the free negroes of Carolina. Most valuable land a league from the town, half cultivated and half abandoned; every thing left to starved slaves; such famished objects I never beheld; no other hands to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general, they will not work, and famine must ensue.  ID387 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	09 	07 	inform 	Spes addita suscitat iras, Hope inflames resentment. Vengeance against the injuries we have inflicted on the Negroes, when they are inflamed with the hope of emancipation, will be livelier than gratitude for freedom to which they are entitled in justice. The insurrections among the slaves in the French West India islands form a dismal presage of what we may expect in our own. We have managed this business not like men of sense, concerned in a general welfare of the British empire, but with the pedantry and precipitation of school boys.  ID388 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	09 	07 	inform 	From some late communications it is evident, that as much sugar may be made on the new lands in the States of New-York and Pennsylvania as will supply the whole United States, and perhaps in a little time furnish an article of exportation. The profits of the manufactory of sugar, when made by private families, will be greater than when made by large works. A boiler, which will cost only 16s. will be the whole expence that will be necessary to carry on this business, and the sugar may be made at a season of the year when no work can be done upon a farm. The price of it, when sent to Philadelphia, will be twice as high as the same quantity of wheat. The sugar trees may be made to yield their juice without being injured, and when they decay, fresh ones may easily be cultivated in the soil upon which they now grow. When we consider the value of sugar, its general and wholesome use in diet, and above all, that it has hitherto been obtained at the price of the lives and liberty of our African brethren, we cannot help congratulating our fellow citizens upon the prospect of manufactories of that article being established among us, whereby immense sums of money will be saved to our country, and, what is more, our country freed from the guilt of encouraging the detestable traffic in human creatures. Several hundred sugar-kettles, we hear, are now making in New Jersey, for the use of the the New England settlers of the Susquehannahand Delaware.
