She is heavy laden, having on board six hundread hogsheads of tobacco, a large quantity of pipe staves, barrel hoops, &c. and has been expected more than two months. Eight per cent was offered as insurance on ship and cargo, but refused, on account of the then probability of a war.  ID95 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1793 	07 	29 	inform 	A great number of white people and white families have been killed and scalped by the Indians in the back settlements of America. Among the killed and scalped is Mr. Pugh, son of Colonel Pugh. The Indians are determined on war with the Americans. They are headed by Gilpin, the successor of M'Gillivray, and have already commenced hostilities on the back settlements of Carolina.  ID104 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1812 	08 	29 	inform 	Montreal, July 4 This city has been for a few days past in a state of agitation occasioned by an event which has taken place at Pointe Claire ; and as this matter will be clothed, no doubt, in all the dress of misrepresentatation by our neighbouring enemies, from the information they may receive of it, we consider it a duty, we owe to the community at large in this country, to state the circumstances as they occurred, in a fair, open, and candid manner. By the late militia law, 2000 young men are to be drafted from the general militia of the province for three months to be properly trained, and of course, a certain proportion of this number is to be furnished by each particular district. Some those drafted from the Parish of Pointe Claire refused to march to Lapraire, for the purpose of joining the division stationed there ; in consequence of which, Major, Leprohon, belonging to this particular battalion, was sent on Tuesday last, with 22 attendants, to apprehend these refractory persons as deserters. They apprehended four with some opposition ; and on their way to town with them, they were followed by a considerable number of persons who rescued one prisoner, and threatened that they would next day proceed to the depot at Lapraire, and bring away by force from thence the young men of the parish, who were there on duty. Accordingly, on Wednesday, a large body of these people assembled at La Chine, with the intention of carrying their threats into execution. Thomas M'Cord, Esq. one of the Police Magistrates, about four o'clock in the afternoon, left town, accompanied by the light infantry of the 49th regiment, and a detachment of the royal artillery, with two field-pieces, under the command of Major Plenderleath, and took post on a point opposite to the insurgents (consisting of about 400 persons, 87 of whom appeared to be armed) and at the distance[?] of about two acres. Mr M'Cord, with some other respectable citizens, pointed out the impropriety of their conduct, and the fate that would unfortunately await their perseverance ; urging them, by every persuasion, to disperse and return peaceably to their horses and obey the law. They replied, that they did not consider the militia bill as fully passed–that they were informed it had not received the Royal sanction ; and that although it might have passed the House of Assembly, where it originated, it had not obtained the approbation of the other branches of the Legislate ; that the law, if really enacted, had not been promagated amongst them, and that they were not properly made acquainted with it ; as such, they could not pay obedience to it. Under this false and unfortunate impression, these deluded people persisted ; but at the same time declared, with shouts of Vive le Roi that if the Government wanted their services at any time, they were ready, one and all, to come forward with their lives in the defence of their country, and that they would prove themselves, in the hour of danger, to be faithful subjects to a Government to which they were firmly attached by every principle. Finding, however, that they still persisted in their determination on this particular object, Mr M'Cord, in his Magisterial capacity, read the riot act to them and ordered them to disperse ; which not being complied with, a round shot was fired by the artillery, but elevated above injury, which was returned by the insurgents in a spirited fire with ball, deserving of a better cause. The troops then fired a volley with ball and grape, but still too much elevated to do any harm which was also returned by another discharge from the mob, upon which a few direct shots were fired at them (it being nearly dark) by the military, which made them disperse, and one man was found killed and another wounded, it is feared mortally.  ID105 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1812 	10 	03 	inform 	Upper Canada York, July, 28. Yesterday, at an early hour, his Honour, Isaac Brock, Esq. administering the Government of Upper Canada, and Major-General, commanding his Majesty's forces therein, arrived at this place from Fort-George, and accompanied by a numerous suite proceeded to the Government Building at four p.m. when he opened the present extra session of the Legislature, and delivered the following speech to both houses :– Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislature, Council and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly, The urgency of the present crisis is the only consideration which would have induced me to call you together, at a time when public as well as private duties elsewhere demand your care and attention. But, Gentlemen, when invaded by an enemy whose avowed object is the entire conquest of this province, the voice of loyalty, as well as of interest, calls aloud to every person, in the sphere in which he is placed, to defend his country. Our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it ; they have evinced, by the promptitude and loyalty of their conduct, that they are worthy of the King whom they serve and of the constitution which they enjoy ; and it affords me particular satisfaction, that, while I address you as Legislators, I speak to mean who, in the day of danger, will be ready to assist, not only with their counsels, but with their arms. We look, Gentlemen, to our militia, as well as to the regular forces, for our protection ; but I should be wanting to that important trust committed to my care, if I attempted to conceal (what experience, the great instructor of mankind, especially of legislators, has discovered) that amendment in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient. It is for you to consider what further improvements they still may require. Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly, From the history and experience of our mother country, we learn, that in times of actual invasion or internal commotion the ordinary course of criminal laws has been found in adequate to secure his Majesty's Government from private treachery, as well as from open disaffection ; and that at such times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws restraining, for a limited period, the liberty of individuals, in many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the particulars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion of the province might justify me in the exercise of the full power reposed in me on such an emergency, yet it will be more agreeable to me to receive the sanction of the Houses. A few traitors have already joined the enemy–have been suffered to come into the country with impunity–and have been harboured and concealed in the interior ; yet the general spirit of loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of this province, is such as to authorise a just expectation that their efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing– The disaffected, I am convinced, are few–To protect and defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations, is an object worthy of your most serious deliberations. The speech concludes with a call for supplies. Proclamation The unprovoked declaration of war by the United States of America, against the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and its dependencies, has been followed by the actual invasion of this province in a remote frontier of the western districts, by a detachment of the United States. The officer commanding that detachment has thought proper to invite his Majesty's subjects, not merely to a quiet and unresisting submission, but insults them with a call to seek voluntarily the protection of his Government. Without condescending to repeat the illiberal epithets bestowed in this appeal of the American Commander to the people of Upper Canada, on the administration of his Majesty, every inhabitant of the province is desired to seek the confutation of such indecent slander in the review of his own particular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian subject, who can truly affirm to himself that he has been injured by the Government in his person, his property, or his liberty? Where is to be found, in any part of the world, a growth so paid in prosperity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled not thirty years by a band of veterans, exiled from their former possessions on account of their loyalty, not a descendant of these brave people it to be found, who, under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign, has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment, superior to what were possessed by their ancestors. This unequalled prosperity would not have been attained by the utmost liberality of the Government, or the persevering industry of the people, had not the maritime power of the mother country secured to its colonists a safe access to every market where the produce of their labour was in request. The unavoidable and immediate consequence of a separation from Great Britain, must be the loss of this inestimable advantage, and what is offered to you in exchange? To become a territory of the United States, and share with them that exclusion from the ocean which the policy of their Government enforces ; you are not even flattered with a participation of their boasted independence ; and it is but too obvious, that once exchanged from the powerful protection of the United Kingdom, you must be re-annexed to the dominion of France, from which the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms of Great Britain at vast expence of blood and treasure, from no other motive than to relieve her ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire of France, was the stipulated reward for the aid afforded to the revolted colonies, now the United States ; the debt is still due, and there can be no doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consideration for commercial advantages, or rather for an expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over the commercial world. Are you prepared, inhabitants of Canada, to become willing subjects, or rather slaves to the despot who rules the nation of Europe with a rod of iron? If not, arise in a body, exert your energies, co-operate cordially with the King's regular forces, to repel the invader, and do not give cause to your children, when groaning under the oppression of a foreign master, to reproach you with having too easily parted with the richest inheritance of this earth–a participation in the name, character, and freedom of Britain. [The proclamation concludes with a declaration, that should the Americans refused quarter in consequence of Indians being found in Canadian ranks, that a severe and rigorous retaliation will take place.] Isaac Brock, Major-Gen. and President Head-quarters, Fort George, July 22, 1812.  ID107 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1812 	11 	09 	inform 	Extract of a letter from Montreal Sept. 25 Our Friend Mr – arrived in town from New York a few days ago. On his way he passed three days at Plattsburgh, the head-quarters of the American army, which, from ocular observation, he states to consist of 8 or 10,000 men, under the command of General Bloomfield, Mooar, and Petit. This force is composed of 3 or 4000 regulars, about the same number of militia, and some volunteers from the southward. The militia is almost all from the state of New York, for the Yankees still refuse to march. with this force no doubt is entertained here but they will make an attack ; and if they mean to make it this season, they must be prompt in their movements, for the weather is getting cold, and they are not well clothed or appointed. Mr –, indeed, states half of them to be without shoes or stockings, which will never do for a winter campaign in this country. To repel the threatened attack, we are making every preparation in our power, and the Canadians seem well disposed to second the Government. Sir George Prevost has established a cordon, the left of which is at Chambly, and extending to Chateaguny ; the main encampment is half way between St John's and La Prairie. Colonel Murray is at St John's with a battalion ; and the Isle-auNoix is strongly fortified, with a boom and a chain secured across the river. This line of defence is composed of four regiments of the line, and 2000 drafted militia, with a corps of about 400 Canadian voltigeurs, raised last spring. The Royals, a very strong battalion, lately arrived from the West Indies, are now marching to join the camp. The citizens, both here and at Quebec, mount guard, and do garrison : indeed there are in this island (Montreal) five battalions of militia, say 3 to 4000 men, pretty well disciplined, and who on an alarm could march to this cordon in half a day.– A new regiment of embodied militia has lately been formed by drafts from the different regiments of inrolled militia in this island, and old Major Murray is appointed Lieutenant-Colonel. The gentlemen of the North-west Company army are forming a corps of their voyageurs, who will be most useful troops to act in advance with the Indians. The number originally proposed was 200, but the men have come forward so handsomely, that they are to consist of 500. Mr M'Gillivray is Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of this corps, Mr Shaw, Major, and the other partners of the Company are Captains and subalterns ; so that the men being commanded by those whom they have accustomed to obey, may be considered as already disciplined, at least in point of subordination. Sir George confines his operations to mere defence. La Motte, with about 70 Indians, advanced through the woods, about ten days ago, within hearing of this redoubtable army, and set up a war whoop, which so completely terrified them that though they could see no enemy, they lay on their arms for two two successive nights, in no expectation of an attack–to prevent which, they cut down their best bridge, and destroyed all the roads by which I suppose they mean to invade us. Mr –, who was several days at their headquarters, and who was offered the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the army, has, it is said, proposed to Sir George to destroy their camp with 500 men ; and Sir George is said to have replied, that his plan was fixed, not to make any attack nor to send a man across the line. This forebearance, which the Yankees impute to fear or weakness, tends only to increase their insolent swaggering, and their enmity is to inveterate to be allayed by any thing but hard knocks.  ID108 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1813 	10 	16 	inform 	The Rota frigate arrived on Monday off Plymouth, with a fleet from Halifax under convoy, and passed up the channel with the chief part of the trade. From the Hydra transport, which put into Plymouth, we have received the following official notification of Sir James Yeo's success on Lake Ontario, the American notices of which have already been published. Bulletin. Head-quarters Kingston, Aug. 14. 1813 By accounts received from his Excellency the Governor in Chief and Commander of the forces, from Commodore Sir James Yeo, dated off York, half-past one P.M. on the 11th instant, the following particulars have been transmitted of the capture and loss of the enemy's armed schooners:– On Thursday evening last, the 10th instant, the enemy's squadron, under the Command of Commodore Chauncey, got under weigh from their anchorage, off the mouth of Niagara River, and, with a fine breeze from the east, stood towards our fleet, which were becalmed off the port of Twelve Mile Creek. At sun-set, a breeze coming off the land, gave us the wind of the enemy, when our squadron stood for them, on which immediately bore away from us under as much sail as their schooners could carry to keep up with their larger vessels. The enemy's fleet formed a long. The Pike, Madison, Oneida, and six schooners (two schooners were placed to windward for the purpose of raking the masts of our squadron as it should come up). At eleven the squadron got within gun-shot of the schooners, when they opened a brisk fire, and, from their going so fast, it was more than an hour before the Wolf, our headmost ship, could pass them ; at this time the rest of the squadron was two and three miles astern of the Wolf, and on her coming up with the Madison and Pike, they put before the wind and made sail, firing their stern-chasers.– Sir J. Yeo finding it impossible to get the squadron up with the enemy, as the Wolf was the only ship which could keep up with them, then made sail between them and the two schooners to windward, which he captured, and which are called the Julia and Growler, each carrying one long 32pounder and long 12-pounder, and 40 men.– Two of the enemy's largest schooners, the Scourge, of 10, and Hamilton, of nine guns, upset on the night of the 9th, in carrying sail, and all on board perished (about 100 in number). By this loss and capture, the enemy's squadron are reduced to 10 vessels, and our's increased to eight. It is ascertained that the Pike mounts 28 long 24-pounders, and 420 men, the Madison 22 long 32 pounders, and 340 men. Boat loads of troops were taken on board the enemy's squadron on Monday last, for the purpose, it is supposed, of repelling the boarders.– The Wolf has not received any material injury, and not a person hurt. The prisoners were landed on the 11th instant, and the Growler's damage repaired. She had lost her bowsprit, and was otherwise cut up. Nothing could exceed the eagerness and enthusiasm of the officers and men in our squadron for a close engagement.  ID109 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1813 	10 	07 	inform 	(From the Quebec Mercury.) Attack on Fort Schlosser. Head-quarters, Kingston, July 13. By accounts from the army under Major-General De Rottenburg, dated the 9th instant, the following particulars have been received of a bold and successful attempt to surprise the American post at Fort Schlosser. In the night of the 4th instant, a party, consisting of Volunteer Thompson and six privates of the 49th regiment, under Ensign Winder, and thirty-four of the militia, the whole under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Clarke, of the Lincoln militia, crossed over in boats from Chippawa to Fort Schlosser, which they reached a little before day-break, and completely surprised the guard, consisting of two Lieutenants, one serjeant, and eight privates, whom they made prisoners, together with three civilians and three of our own subjects, found in the Fort.– The party remained in the Fort about one hour, loading their boats form the public stores and wharf, and brought with them one brass six-pounder, 57 stand of arms, two and a half kegs of musket ball cartridges, 6 bulwarks of musket proof curtains for boats, one gun-boat, two batteaux, 20 barrels of salt, 17 casks tobacco, eight barrels of pork, and one barrel of whiskey, with a number of spades, oars, and axes ; a small party of the enemy had collected as the last boast pushed off from the shore, and several shots were fired, but the boats returned to Chippawa with their prisoners, and the articles they had captured, without a man being hurt on this service. Further accounts have also been received from the army highly creditable to the Indian warriors serving with it. On the 8th instant, a party of the King's regiment, and a body of Indian warriors were sent to endeavour to recover a considerable quantity of medicines and surgical instruments which had been buried near the Fort George when our troops retired from it. A skirmish ensued in consequence between the Indians and the enemy, in which the latter lost one officer and 20 men killed and 10 taken prisoners–the whole of the medicines and instruments were brought off by the party of the King's; the only loss sustained being three Indians wounded. Captain Norton led the Indian warriors with great spirit ; and much credit is due to Captain Merrit of the Provincial dragoons, for reconnoitering the spot where the medicines were deposited, and conducting the party to it. A few nights ago, the barracks at Gravelly Point burnt by our gun-boats, and more than 100 barrels of pork, flour, and other articles brought away from thence, together with a very fine Durham boat–500 oars colleced and partly loaded in her for Sacket's Harbour, being destroyed. Attack on Black Rock Head-quarters, Kingston, July 15 1813. G. O.–His Excellency the Commander of the forces has received a dispatch from Major General De Rottenburg, reporting a successful attack upon the enemy's post and dockyard at Black Rock at daybreak on the morning of the 11th inst. by detachments of the King's and 41st regiments, together with Liutenant Fitzgibbon's party of the 49th, and about 40 militia, the whole amounting to 240 men, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp. The enemy's position was carried by a spirited attack without the loss of a single man. Several large boats, loaded with stores and provisions, and three field pieces, a twelve and two six-pounders, were brought away ; a vessel and all the naval store-houses and barracks have been burnt. Unfortunately before the evacuation of the post was completed, a strong reinforcement of the enemy, aided by Indians, pressed this small detachment, by which Captain Saunders, of the 41st, and 15 men, were killed ; Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp, Lieutenant Montpesson, of the 41st, and 15 rank and file, wound ed. The wounded were brought over. Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp has received three wounds, severe, but not considered dangerous. By his Excellency's command, Edward Baynes, Adjutant-General British Expedition to Plattsburgh The following is an extract of a letter from a respectable citizen at Burlington, dated Aug. 1. 1813 An express arrived at Burlington on the 30th July, with intelligence that the British had left the Isle au Noix, with a force consisting of the two armed sloops, of 11 guns each, and four gallies, of one gun each, and 100 batteaux full of men, and had progressed within one mile of the town. The camp was instantly alarmed, and the troops under arms, but no enemy appeared. Next day we learnt that about 1000 troops, under the command of Colonel Murray, had landed, and took possession of Plattsburgh without opposition, there being no force to oppose them except the militia of the town and vicinity, who being only 400 in number, retreated as the enemy advanced. The arsenal belonging to the State, Pike's encampment, barracks at Serenac cantonment, and every building belonging to the United States, were immediately burnt. The enemy obtained both provisions and stores. The loss cannot be less than 50,000 dollars. The enemy left Plattsburgh on the 1st, and are understood to be proceeding this way ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? On General Dearborn invading Canada, and taking possession of Fort George, he sent off to Greenbush, as prisoners of war, the following respectable inhabitants : Messrs Edwards, Murehead, Dickson Lyminston, Lawe, two Kerrs, M'Ewan, Parson Addison, Howell, Heron, Green, Baldwin, Clinch Jones, Ball, Decoe, and John Crook. Messrs Lawe, M'Ewen and the two Kerrs were wounded on the 27th June. General Dearborn expected that the inhabitants would have joined the Americans. General Dearborn resigned the command of the Niagara army on the 23th June, on account of indisposition. General Lewis says, in his dispatch to Secretary at War, that he did not think the General would ever again be fit for service ; that the unfortunate events of the war had deranged his understanding ; and that thought sometimes in a state of convalescence, he uniformly relapsed when military topics were alluded to. General Lewis having been nominated to command at Sacket's Harbour, is succeeded at Fort George, Niagara, and on the Canadian frontier, by General Boyd. The Indian chief, Tecumseh, has seized the favourable moment of the diversion by our shipping in Virginia, for surround Fort Meigs with 2000 warriors. He had deprived the garrison of all the possibility of receiving supplies. General Clay, who commanded there, had written urgently to General Harrison for assistance. The latter was collecting his army to march to his relief. Sir James Yeo, after the retreat of the enemy's army at Fort George, swept the American side of Lake Ontario. He landed a body of troops at Great Sodus, and took the whole of the provisions, consisting of several hundred barrels of pork and flour, and burnt the buildings. The British loss was a serjeant and four privates of the Royal killed. At Genessee River, he inflicted the same loss on the enemy, taking 500 barrels of pork and 1700 bushels of corn. The provisions were delivered to General Vincent. Four companies of the Royals were embarked on board the fleet, to serve as mariners There were at Quebec, on the 22d July, 1000 American prisoners of war, captured since the commencement of the campaign. At Beaufort there were 50 officers including three General. In consequence of the conduct of the American Government and of the officers, the latter are no longer permitted to return home on parole. The Melpomene frigate, with De Meuron's regiment, from the Mediterranean, arrived in the river St. Lawrence on the 20th July. James Gready, private in the 8th, or King's regiment, and Terence Hunt, private in the 6th foot, were in the latter end of June, tried by Court Martials, for deserting to the enemy, and being found in arms, and were publicy shot at Kingston, Canada, pursuant to their sentence. It appears from the Quebec papers, and from the general orders issued by the Commander in Chief in Canada that on the late defeat of General Wilkinson on the banks of the Miami river, the American military chest, containing 15,000l. Sterling was among the property captured by the British. Captain Waugh, of the 103d regiment, died at Chamely on the 2d July. General Hampton has arrested Colonel Clark, the late commandant at Burlington, for a defalcation of about 50,000 dollars.  ID110 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1813 	12 	30 	inform 	By the Dunlop, Captain Abrams, arrived on Sunday last, at Greenock, from Quebec, after a passage of 36 days, papers and letters have been received from Canada, to the 19th, which contain an amount of an engagement between a detachment of the British force under Lieut.-Col. Morrison, consisting of the 49th[?] and 89th regiments, with some companies of the Canadian militia, and a body of American troops, amounting to 4000 men, which ended in the defeat of the latter, with great loss. This action was produced by the attempt of the American General to advance to Montreal, from which it appears, however, he has now begun to measure back his steps, having crossed to the American side of the river where the action was fought, and being actively pur sued in his retreat by the British troops. The following information has been received by the Alexander, Captain Henry, which arrived at Liverpool on Tuesday:– Quebec, Nov. 26. 1813 The enemy's whole force was about 8000 men, under the command of General Wilkinson. The division commanded by General Boyd, consisting of about 3000 to 4000 infantry, cavalry &c. was alone engaged upon the 11th instant. The enemy lost in the action, Brigadier Gen. Conington and Colonel Preston, killed–probably 600 men killed, wounded, and taken. The consequence was a precipitate retreat across the St Lawrence at Cornwall on the 13th, and evacuating the province. General Wilkinson marched his troops into the Straits, the route of Plattsburgh, leaving all his boats, upwards of 300, in the Salmon river, where they were frozen in on the 16th, and 2000 men to protect them. Colonel Plenderleath came home in the Alexander, with dispatches.  ID111 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1814 	03 	19 	inform 	The following letter received in town, gives a description of the wanton and barbarous conduct of the American army, in destroying a settlement of the Moravian missionaries, in their late irruption into province:– Yesterday I received a very afflicting account from North America, by a letter from New York, dated Dec. 27 1813, concerning a report of the total destruction of our settlement, ??? ??? on the 6th of October, by the American army under General Harrison. It was the consequence of the invasion of that province, after the capture of the little fleet on Lake Erie, and the defeat of the s[?]al British force under the [?] of occupying the Chapel and some other houses for our sick British soldiers, and considering the danger the Christian Indians were in from the malice of the Americans, it was his advice, that the Missionaries and the Indian Congregation should retreat farther into the country. When the Americans were successful in the latter, it became necessary to take steps of effect it. The British behaved very kindly to the brethren, and offered to purchase the houses and cottages, but their defeat prevented it. On entering the place, the Americans first pretended to be friendly, and sorry that the Indians had fled, who had gone with Mr and Mrs Denke (one of the Missionaries) up the river. Mr and Mrs Schnall, and the aged Missionary, Michael Young, remained. During the first night the Americans already changed their tone, or rather showed their real character. They began to abuse the Missionaries with curses, and all manner of insults, plundering the houses ; and General Harrison, to whom we appealed, would grant no redress. They took every thing that was??? away ; and, under a pretence that King's stores and English goods were lodged in the houses, ransacked every place, and every trunk and chest belonging to individuals. Commodore Perry, who had defeated the Mosquito fleet on the lake, was there, and behaved rather better than the rest, advicing the Missionaries to get away as fast as they could. They did so with difficulty, and shortly after the Americans set the place on fire, and burnt down the whole, even every outhouse[?]. The poor Missionaries had a very tedious journey, and reached Silitiz, a settlement of the Brethren in Pennsylvania, December 11. Whither the Christian Indians have fled is not known ; they had proposed to go to the Grand River, about 100 miles off.  ID113 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1814 	09 	12 	inform 	[Extracts of Letters from Quebec and Montreal.] Quebec, July 15. The commercial world is flourishing here, but in political matters, I am sorry to say, we are sadly in the back ground. The old defensive system is still adhered to, and, I fear much, with all our reinforcements, we shall do little good till we have another commander in chief. There is now a great body of regular troops in this country, and a handful of brave fellows have recently been almost sacrificed par la petite guerre at Chippawa, whilst, in the lower province, there are at least 10,000 regulars doing nothing. Some of the officers of the regiments lately arrived from France do not conceal their sentiments– On inspecting one of the regiments the other day, our chief took occasion, as usual, to make some remarks on the cut of the men's clothes, when the Colonel commanding stepped forward and told him plainly, that such systems were now completely exploded–that he had had the honour of serving very lately under a much more celebrated General that it was probable he would ever serve under again–that his men had been accustomed to fight, not to dance ; and if such was the plan he was called on to follow, he should certainly retire from the service. Such language you may suppose was not very pleasing to our Governor ; but I am happy to find that we now have military men amongst us, who are not afraid to speak out ; as it appears the numberless representations of civilians are not much attended to. Montreal, July 14. I consider this country now as perfectly secure against any attempts that the Americans may make, not withstanding the system of our chief does not seem to be changed. He has received a great many more troops this year than he had any idea of, and does not seem pleased at having so large a force unhis command, as the country will now look to him for some offensive operation against the enemy. He has done nothing the whole summer but parade about 6000 men at Chambly, where he makes them march past him twice a-week, bowing and scraping, instead of employing them where they ought to be. You will have heard of an American army of about 6000, under General Jacob Brown, having crossed the river at Fort Erie, when General Rial, with a force of 1500 only, gallantly assailed them but was overpowered by numbers, and sustained considerable loss. I inclose a general order published yesterday about this unfortunate business, whereby you will find that our loss has been great. Upon this frontier the Americans have hardly any force, and it appears very singular indeed, that so great a body of men, as are now on the other side of the river, from Sorel to Isle Aux Noix, at least 10,000 men, should be left for the purpose of parade, when they are so much wanted in the upper province. I sincerely hope that some investigation will take place into this business, as it is really disgraceful to think that such an enemy should be able to make an attack upon us with impunity.  ID114 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1814 	10 	15 	inform 	Quebec, Sept. 10. The Americans, to the number of 900 men, landed and at tacked Fort Michillimackinac, in Lake Huron, on the 4th August. They were repulsed by the British garrison. The American fort la Prairie du Chiens has been taken by the British. This place was considered as of great importance to the enemy. Major General Conran, of the Royal, has had the misfortune to break his leg, by a fall from his horse. This officer had just arrived to join the army on the Niagara frontier, when he met with this accident. On the 31st August, the British troops broke their encampment at Odell Town, near Lake Champlain, and proceeded immediately to take possession of the position which the American army had just abandoned at the village of Champlain. This army was commanded by General Izard, and are said to have proceeded partly to Plattsburgh, and partly to Sackett's Harbour, on Lake Ontario. The British troops now at Champlain are commanded by Major Gene rals Brisbane, Power, and Robinson, and consist of the 13th, 49, 88th, Meuron's regiment, Canadian chasseurs, &c. &c. The 79th[?] or [?] Glasgow Lowland regiment are now quartered at Cornwall, in Upper Canada. The 4th[?] battalion of the 1st, or Royal Scots, are stationed at Quebec. The 3rd[?], 104th flank[?] companies, 103d, 8th, or King's, 100th, regiment de Watteville, [?] battalion of 1st, or Royal Scots, and 41st flank[?] companies are with the army under Lieutenant General Drummon, on the Niagara frontier, Upper Canada. The 37th and 57th regiments are at Montreal. On the 15th of August, the British troops under Lieutenant General Drummond assaulted Fort Erie. The attack was made in three columns, under Colonel Scott of the 103d regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Drummond 104th regiment, and Lieutenant Colonel Fischer of de Watteville's. The two former were directed to scale the fort, and the latter to get possession of a small hill, named Snake-Hill, which the Americans had fortified, and being situated only about eight hundred yards from Fort Erie, was of consequence to us. This latter column failed in their object ; but the two columns destined for the fort carried the same in a most gallant manner, and obliged the enemy to retire into two stone block-houses inside the fort, when their own guns were turned against them. At this time a most unfortunate explosion took place, which blew up the magazine and battery, and with them a number of our brave soldiers ; and the consternation caused by this was so great, and we were obliged to abandon our conquest, and retreat to our original position, with great loss of both officers and men. The large ship-building by the British at Kingston, on Lake Ontario is to be launched the second week in September– also will carry about 100 guns. The battalion of royal marines, commanded by LieutenantColonel Williams, and which has been stationed lately at Isle au Noix, and parts adjacent, have been broken up and distributed among the fleets on the Lakes. The Staff of the battalion proceed immediately to Halifax from Quebec, in the Ceylong armed-en [?] ship. The Junon frigate, Captain Upton, has arrived from Halifax at Quebec, with money for Government. The crew of this vessel is to be employed on the Lakes. A brig, which sailed from Cork, under convoy of the Antelope, of 50 guns, has arrived at Quebec.–The Antelope, and the ships under convoy, are hourly expected. It is said that there are on board the ships of the latter about 4000 troops, chiefly detachments and reinforcements for the regimentsin Canada. Captain Dowale, of the royal navy, now commands the fleet on Lake Champlain.  ID115 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1814 	10 	15 	inform 	Canada Papers Quebec, Sept. 3. The army from this province has entered the United States by the Champlain frontier. On the 1st inst. the advance was at Chazy. Quebec, Sept. 8. From the north-western frontier of Upper Canada, Messrs M'Gillivray and M'Leod, who arrived here on Thursday last, have brought dispatches from Lieutenant Colonel M'Donal, at Michillimackinac, written since the repulse of the American forces sent there to recapture it. The following are the particulars of that expedition :– On the forenoon of the 5th of August, the Americans landed 900 men, or thereabouts, at the back of the island (Dowsman's farm). There is a considerable space of ground cleared, and a gentle slope, which enabled their vessels, at anchor close to the beach, to keep clear, by a constant fire of grape, &c. and which by the situation of the ground, passed directly over the men's heads, as they formed and advanced towards the woods. Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual[?] formed his small garrison (150 at most) at the extremity of the woods, and the Indians were stationed on each flank, to keep the enemy from outflanking the troops. By a false account of the enemy's intention to land on another part of the island, a certain number of Indians were sent to watch their motions ; but more Indians absenting themselves, exposed one flank of Lieutenant-Colonnel M'Doual's party entirely ; and an apprehension was entertained that the enemy would outflank and cut off the garrison from the forts ; it was therefore deemed expedient to fall back between the two forts, and there await the advance of the enemy. A party of between 40 and 50 Indians, placed on the left flank, and ignorant of the movements in the centre and right flank, fired on the Americans, and threw them into confusion, which the Indians soon perceived, and encouraging each other by whoops and yells, totally broke the little order still observed by the enemy, who took instant flight, and were all out of reach before Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual was apprised of their retreat. Thus was a body of at least from six to nine hundred men defeated and put to instant flight by 40 or 50 Indians, with a loss of 17 men and a Major (Holmes) killed and found on the spot!–The Indians lost but one man. Previous to and combined with this, the measures taken by the enemy were these: On the [?] of July, a detachment of the expedition sent against Michillimackinac by the enemy, proceeded to St Mary's, where they met with no resistance, there being neither troops nor Indians, and every person occupied about their usual concerns ; such as bay making, fishing &c. Major Holmes commanded the party, who gave up to indiscriminate plunder, and destroyed the whole of the property belonging to the North West Company ; burning their houses, stores, and vessels, killing their cattle, and taking off their engagees prisoners ; tearing down the fences, destroying the gardens, fields, &c. Many wanton acts of cruelty might be detailed. Let two suffice for the present. Mr Johnstone's property was plundered, even his furniture ; the very clothing of his wife and children was seized upon by these ruthless plunderers, and carried away. Major Holmes sent to the south side of the strait for Mr Johnstone's son George, and, after threatening and reviling him with the most oppobrious language, flourished his sword over his head, and said he had a great mind to cut his head off, now he was his slave, When they were in the act of burning the houses and stores, Mr G. Johnstone was ordered to stand in a certain spot, under pain of being shot ; but had he remained, sufforation[?] must have been his fate, being so near the buildings in flames : he therefore risked being shot, and came off, and thereby effected a timely escape. Another instance of more than savage cruelty was exercised on a poor horse, which they made us of all day in carting their plunder, and in the evening, whilst still tackled to the cart, tied him to the end of the dwelling-house then in flames, and amused themselves in looking at the poor animal making vain efforts to get loose ; but there he was burnt, and his bones seen there by the writer of this.  ID116 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1814 	12 	08 	inform 	Canada Papers Montreal, Oct. 29 The express from Upper Canada, which arrived yesterday morning, confirmed the highly satisfactory reports of the preceding day, that the enemy had precipitately retreated on the 19th instant, from before Chippawa, after destroying a quantity of provisions and heavy baggage ; and that, on the 21st, they had passed over to Buffaloe a great part of their force, and were blowing up the works at Fort Erie. Further accounts from Kingston have been received this morning to the 26th instant, when the official report of the enemy's retreat from Fort Erie, after the destruction of the works, had not reached that place, but there was no doubt of the fact. Major-Genera de Watteville commanded the corps pressing on the enemy ; the master of a mail which arrived at Kingston on the 25th, in twenty-four hours from Fort George, further confirms the previous intelligence, and reports that several hundred prisoners were taken, before the Americans effected their escape across the river. On the 18th the British came up with his rear guard, and in a sharp action thirty of the Americans were left on the field wihtout a casualty happening on our side. This was at Chippawa Creek.– The enemy then fled with the utmost precipitation to Fort Erie, and began the destruction of his fortifications. A military courier from Kingston arrived this morning, brings no additional news of importance.– Sir James Yeo had returned to Kingston with the sick of the army of Niagara on board. We again sailed for the head of the Lake. A private letter from Niagara of the 10th instant, says that a severe action took place the day before near Chippawa ; our loss is stated at 10 killed and wounded. That of the enemy is supposed to be very considerable ; a field piece made to bear upon one of his columns did great execution. Another letter denies any loss in killed but makes the wounded 25 or 30. Montreal, Nov. 5. From Upper Canada we have received nothing of importance. The report of the whole American armies have crossed the Niagara was a mistake as the last accounts from that quarter mention that General Brown was still in possession of Fort Erie. Quebec, Nov. 3. We are in expectation of some further details of the operations on the Niagara frontier by this day's Montreal post ; but they had no arrived at one o'clock. The evacuation by the enemy of our territory on that frontier is a striking illustration of the importance of the command of the lake. The enemy did cross over to our side till the moment his fleet was ready to assume the superiority. The re-appearance of our fleet effected what could not be done by the expence of so much blood and treasure. (From the Quebec Gazette) The American Government has published the pa pers relating to the late negotations at Ghent. We confess that we have seen these papers with feelings of some satisfaction and much regret ; satisfaction that we can now say that the honour of the British Government is pledged to do something for British interests in North American, and regret that that something is so little. The Indians are to be made independent of both nations. This is perfectly just, and would, under certain cirumstances greatly add to the security of these provinces. The Lakes are to be exclusively British. On these subjects we must be permitted to ask how long they would be permitted to remain so, how long the Indians would retain their independence in the event of another war, if the communication with them should be in the power of the enemy ? The sole communication for military purposes, with the Indians and the Lakes, is by the river St Lawrence, from Montreal to Kingston, and from Niagara to Fort Erie ; and the Americans are to be permitted to remain in possession of one of its banks ! The enemy has hitherto been prevented from interrupting this communication by the thinness of the settlements of their side, the consequent badness of the roads, and difficulty of supplying a large force. The possession of th southern bank of the St Lawrence between Montreal and Kingson, and the power of supplying themselves, and operating on that frontier, by the roads now existing, and from Lake Champlain, has been worth a large force to them, during the whole of the war ; it has caused us to parcel our force to support the line of communication between Lake St Francis and Kingston, and keep a great proportion of it to protect the base of that line in the vicinity of Montreal. The position of Canada, relative to the United States, with its present boundaries, is an extraordinary one ; so much so, that intelligent military men have pronounced it incapable of defence much beyond Quebec. The miserable state of the enemy's preparations, the superiority which we then had on the Lakes, the good disposition of the inhabitants, and the prudent conduct of the commander of the forces, alone saved it. The waste of means in protecting and conveying supplies by a communication of five hundred miles, adjoining the whole way to the enemy's frontie, is conceivable only to those whom experience has made acquainted with the fact, or who are habituated to reflection ; and whenever the communication of the Lakes becomes interrupted, the supply of any force further advanced on the line becomes utterly impracticable. The enemy derives his supplies either by the Lakes, upon which an army can effect nothing, or from a settled country, a long way in his rear, protected by his army, a country covered with woods, and a militia more effective than the best troops in such a country, always ready for the protection of their property and their houses– Under such circumstances, the weakness of an army beyond a certain point is to be counted by its numbers. We scruple not to say, that, whenever that part of the State of New York extending to the St Lawrence, between Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain, shall be fully settled, the whole of Upper Canada must fall to the United States, the Lower Canada will not be defensible but at an expence of means far beyond its value. We had much rather see the Americans confirmed in the possession of Sackett's Harbour, Presqu-ile, Detroit and Michilimackinac, than in the possession of the tract of country just mentioned. Great Britain will always have the means of establishing a superiority on the Lakes, whenever she chuses to exert them, but she never will be able to drive the Americans out of that frontier, when once fully settled, supported as they will be by the immense population of the back parts of the State of New York and adjoining States. From the United States Papers Urbanna, Sept. 25. An express has arrived from Detroit, to General M'Arthur, in six days, in which Governor Cass says– A state of things has arrived, in which your presence, with the force at your disposal, is essential to the security and preservation of the country. The Indians have recommenced hostilities on every side of us ; they are murdering the people, and breaking up the settlements. There is now a large force of them in the immediate vicinity of this place, most probably within a mile of it, with the avowed purpose of attacking the town. We have no force adequate to the defence of the country, and none of description proper for the pursuit of the Indians– My opinion is, that you should hasten on with the mounted men with all possible expedition. The express came by water, the land communiation being entirely cut off. Albany, Oct. 25. The Legislature of this State adjourned yesterday, after a session of four weeks. The principal laws passed are: An act to authorise the raising of troops for the defence of this State. An act to encourage privateering. An act to authorise the raising of a corps of sea fencibles. An act to provide for the repayment of certain sums of money advanced by the Corporation of the city of New York, for the defence of the State, and for other purposes. An act to prevent the apprehension of British deserters. An act to authorise the raising of two regiments of men of colour. An act authorising additional pay to be made to the volunteers, and for paying the militia called into service by the State authority. An act to aid in the apprehension of deserters from the army and navy of the United States. The first act authorises the Governor to call into actual service 12,000 men, for the term of two years, provided the Government of the United States shall have declared their intention to pay, clothe and subsist them at their expence. The privateer bill authorises associations to incorporate themselves for the purpose of fitting out privateers. The following resolution, introduced by Mr Monell, passed both Houses of our Legislature unanimously on Saturday:– Resolved unanimously–That the House of Assembly of the State of New York view, with mingled emotions of surprise and indignation, the extravagant and disgraceful terms proposed by the British Commissioners at Ghent–that, however ardently they may desire the restoration of peace to their country, they can never consent to receive it at the sacrifice of national honour and dignity–that they therefore strongly recommend to the National Legislature the adoption of the vigorous and efficacious measures in the prosecution of the war, as the best means of the bringing the contest to an honourable termination, and of transmitting unimpaired to their posterity their rights, liberty, and independence. The following is a private letter which was brought by the Liffey : Montreal, Nov. 5. 1814. Sir George Prevost reached Kingston on the 10th October, where his presence has been of the utmost importance. Chauncey resigned his blockade of that place on the 8th, and retired with his squadron to Sackett's Harbour. Our fleet which was ready for the Lake in a few days after Sir George's arrival, sailed for Niagara on the 16th, with 500 of the 90th, and a supply of provisions and stores for the right division, and arrived off Fort George on the evening of the 18th. Having landed this reinforce ment, Sir James returned to Kingston on the 24th. The enemy at Fort Erie having been joined by General Izard's army, making a force of 7 or 8000 men, advanced upon General Drummond, and attacked our positions upon the Chippawa on the 15th instant ; but having met with an opposition unexpected by them, and making no impression, retired on the 16th and 17th to Black Creek, from whence they advanced one of Izard's brigades, 1500 men, on the 19th, with a view of our turning our right, and attempted to cross the Chippawa, about six miles from its mouth, where they were met with by a corps of about 1000 troops, under Colonel Meyers, who faced them most manfully ; they skirmished the whole day, in which the Glengarries supported their high character, and, in the evening, Jonathan finding himself foiled, and unable to bring up his artillery from the horrid state of the roads, retired again to the main body at Black Creek. Our casualties on this occasion were triflin– those of the enemy were said to have been considerable, though he refrained from exposing himself to our fire in the open ground. We had two field-pieces there, and whenever the enemy showed a column out of the wood, a well-directed discharge soon obliged them to return to their shelter. By this time our fleet being announced, gave alarm to the enemy, and they commenced a precipitate retreat to Fort Erie. They were purused on the 20th and 21st by our advance, under Major-General Watteville, close to Fort Erie, where he found them occupying the high ground, which General Drummond had not left many weeks before, and could push no further. At the date of the last accounts from General Drummond, Jonathan still maintained his post, from which it will require a few columns of fresh troops to dislodge him, but as they are now on their way to join the right dividion, I trust I shall in a short time have the pleasure to acquaint you of the complete expulsion of the enemy from the Niagara frontier. It is said, that for want of sufficient shelter, a part of General Izard's force had crossed to Buffalo, and that they had passed over some heavy artillery and stores, leaving at the fort such a force as they conceived capable of defending it. Sir James brough down with him the skeleton of the 1st battalion of the King's regiment, and the remains of the two flank companies of the 10th. He sailed again on the 1st inst. taking with him about 1200 men, comprising the 37th, a brigade of artillery, a 9pounder, and detachments from the 6th and 82d regiments, and a large supply of provisions and stores. The five hundred of the 9th regiment who marched to York would be crossed to Niagara in the brigs ; the 9th, 850 strong, were to have been embarked in the fleet, but Sir James could not take them. The Royals, 41st, 89th, and 100th, exhausted corps, return to Kingston by this trip of the fleet, which I fear was scarcely able to make another this season. The St Lawrence has proved a noble ship, and one and all seem delighted with her. The frigate in frame arrived at Kingston, where she has been laid down and lengthened to make her the size of the Prince Regent. The keel of a 74 is also laid down there. The Americans are said to have commenced upon two more ships of the class of the Superior. Letters from Michilimacinack to the 19th October state, that the capture of the two schooners will be attended with the most important benefits in the security of that post, and the territory dependent upon it. Captain Rocheblave, with the detachment of the 81st under Capt. Wardrop, and artillery, arrived there on the 14th October, without any casualty among the troops ; and Mr M'Kenzie, with his brigade, would arrive about the 21st. The two schooners had made a trip to Nottawasage for provisions and supplies, and would attempt another before the navigation closed. A reinforcement had been sent under Capt Bulgar to Praire du Chain. The arrangements necessary for reinforcing and supplying General Drummond's army being completed, and the attack upon Sackett's Harbour being deemed impracticable this season, Sir George returned last evening to this place ; his journey to Kingston has certainly had the effect of inducing General Brown, with a considerable part of his force, to move to Sackett's Harbour, and has thus left General Izard so much weakened at Fort Erie, that I have little doubt of the result of an attack upon him. I am sorry to see that the malice of a certain party here has been at work at your side of the water ; it has increased tenfold since the expression of the public sentiment in favour of his Excellency, by the addresses which are now preparing, and which I can assure you is the real and unsolicited voice of the people. I am happy to find that General Kempt is going to England, as he will afford true information upon the state of the country, and be able to exposethe falsehoods which have been circulated respecting recent events.  ID127 	Caledonian Mercury 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1818 	07 	16 	inform 	Canada Papers from Upper Canada contain the draft of a petition to the Prince Regent, founded on the resolutions adopted in the province of Niagara, where some discontent has been manifested. The first part is as follows:– To his Royal Highness George Prince of Wales, Regent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, &c. the humble Address of the Inhabitants of Upper Canada May it please your Royal Highness, The subjects of your Royal Father, dwelling in Upper Canada, should need no words to give assurance of their loyalty, if the whole truth had reached the throne of their Sovereign. His subjects have reason to believe that the truth has not been told. During three years of war, Upper Canada was exposed to the ravages of a powerful and inveterate foe. The Government of the United States had been long concerting the invasion of this province. Hostile preparations against it had been long masked under other designs ; and at last the accumulated torrent of violence burst on the defencless children of the British empire. Nor were they assailed by the weapons of war alone ; an invidious proclamation preceded those host of the enemy, forgetful of honour, regardless of humanity, and daring to seduce the subjects of Britain from their true allegiance. The subjects of Britain remained dauntless and firm. It was not for their property that they rose against their invaders ; the invader would have spared to them their property. They flew to arms in defence of the rights and sovereignty of Britain. Twice has the American standard been planted in Upper Canada, while yet but a handful of British troops aided the native battalions wave the laurel of victory over the protrate intruders on their soil. The second year of war saw Canada contending with yet little assistance from the parent state. The second year of the war saw her sons confirmed in their virtue, and still more determined to resist. Wives and children had fled from their homes ; the face of the country was laid waste, and the fire of revenge was sent forth to consummate distress and misery ; still was the spirit of the people unextinguished, still did it burn with patriotism and loyalty. By the third year every risk of conquest was at an end, for now the British aid poured into the provinces, and peace was proclaimed when war was no longer to be feared. It is now more than three years since there was an end of war, but, strange to say, these years of peace have manifested no appearance of affection or care from the mother country to the Canadas. Commercial treaties have been made, altogether neglectful of British interests here. Government transactions, which used to give spirit to trade and are at a stand; troops are withdrawn ; fortifications are suffered to go to ruin ; and rumours are abroad too shocking to be repeated in the Royal ear. May it please your Royal Highness to listen calmly to the complains and grievances of the people of Upper Canada who are fully assured that your Royal Highness has been kept ignorant of most important truths ; who are well assured of the generous disposition of your Royal heart, and of your desire that British subjects should every where share equally you paternal regard an affection. It was a matter of much provocation to the people of the province to see, even during the war, which afforded such striking proofs of their loyalty and valour, reports went home highly rating the merits of regular troops, while the tribute due to Canadian levies were unfairly set down, may, the principles of the most loyal subjects here were often stigmatised by British officers, ignorant of human character, and still more so of circumstances which affect it in this part of the world. It was not so with the immortal Brock. He justly appreciated Canadian worth, and his memory will happily long cherish, in the minds of the Canadian people, a due regard for the genuine spirit of a British solider, at once generous and brave. The loyal inhabitants of Upper Canada would disdain to notice the misrepresentations of individuals, so contrary to notorious truth, if these had not obviously conspired with other causes to lessen the regard which should subsist between British subjects here and at home, to influence the conduct of Ministers towards the general interests of the province. The loyal subjects of his Majesty in Upper Canada suffered grievously during the war in their property, and many were bereft of their all. A solemn investigation on this subject took place ; the claims of the sufferers were authenticated, and there was every reason to expect that recompence would immediately follow ; yet nothing has followed but delay and insult. Surely if there is among mankind a single principle of justice, that is one, that the individuals of a nation ought not, partially, to bear the weight of public calamity. Surely individuals who have exposed their lives for Government should not be disgusted with finding Government regardless of those very principles which it is intended to sustain. The people of this province are well aware that their fellow subjects at home are pressed hard with taxations, and far it is from their wish that relief should be afford from thence. Canada contains within itself ample means of exonerating Government from the claims of sufferers by war ; and it is within the fiat[?] of your Royal Highness to remove, by a signle breath, the evil now justly complained of. Millions of acres of fertile lands lie here at the disposal of your Royal Highness, upon the credit of which, under proper management, not only the fair claims of loyal sufferers could be instantly advanced, but vast sums could be raised for the improvement of the provinces, and the increase of revenue to Britain. Another grievance, manifesting the neglect of Government to the concerns of Upper Canada, is equally notorious, and must be still more abhorrent to the general feelings of your Royal Highness. The young men of this province, who were armed in its defence had, for their spirited conduct, the promise of their commanders, that land would be granted them as a reward for their services, as soon as war was terminated ; and after this promise was universaly confided in the Parliament of Upper Canada passed an extraordinary law, in the face of established British principles, that militia should pass beyond the frontier. With these promises, and in obedience to this law, the militia passed beyond the frontier with alacrity ; yet since the peace, the greater part of them had been denied the pledge of their extraordinary services, and the land is unjudtly withheld. The petition further states that such ingratitude, such dishonour, such errors in policy, could not exist without extraordinary influences, and it recommends most important changes equally for the glory of the throne, and benefit of the subject. It says that the scandalous abuses came some years ago to such a pitch of monstrous ingratitude, the the home Ministers wisely imposed restriction on the Land Council of Upper Canada. It seems, however, that all this was insufficient, and that confusion on confusion has grown out of this unhappy system. Upper Canada, it is now said, pines in comparative decay, and that discontent and poverty are experienced in a land supremely blessed with the gifts of nature. It is insisted that the immediate interference of his Royal Highness might do much to remove the evils which spring from the system of patronage and favouritism, and it asserts that the interposition of the British Parliament is more imperiously required. It concludes as follows:– Deeply penetrated with these sentiments, and most seriously inclined to have changes speedily effected, the loyal subjects of Great Britain dwelling in Upper Canada now take the extraordinary step of sending home Commissioners to bear this to the throne, and humbly intreat your Royal Highness to give ear to the details which it will be in their power to relate: above all, that your Royal Highness would immediately send out to this province a commission, consisting of discreet and wise men, men of business and talent, who shall be above every influence here, and who may be instructed to make inquiry into all the sources of evil.  ID139 	Scotsman 	Edinburgh 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1819 	05 	01 	inform 	Leeds, April 19.–We have been somewhat alarmed here to-day, though no bad consequences have followed, by a most numerous assemblage of croppers, cloth-dressers, and other artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep com ing in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley, Armley, Holbeck, and all the neighbouring towns and villages and it is computed that at one time there were full three thousand of these distressed people assembled, chiefly in Briggate. As many of them marched into the town with great sticks in their hands, they created some little alarm, but their conduct was uniformly peaceable; their complaints were not loud, though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and Magistrates, with the whole of the Civil Power, were in rea diness to act as circumstances might require; but, fortunately, there was not the slightest occasion for their interference. By far the greater number of the assemblage dispersed by noon, and returned to their respective homes. Several respectable gentlemen went among them, to ascertain the motives of their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it does not appear that they have the least disposition to commit any breath of the peace ; but in fact, the people know not what to do in their present state of distress. I understand that an active subscription is going, to enable a number of these poor men to proceed to Canada; and others are said to have expressed their wish to be sent to Botany Bay, provided they can obtain the sanction of Government. The case of these people is a very perplexing one ; for their numbers augment daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories. Chester, April 19.–John Bagguely, John Drummond and Samuel Johnson, convicted of sedition on the 15th inst., were this day, after an adrdress from the Chief-Justice (Mr Serjeant Copley,) sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and to find security for their good behaviour for two years, each in L.500 himself with sureties in L.100 each. We are sorry to hear that great number of the agricultural poor are out of employ in Monmouthshire, and that the amount of wages diminishes as works get scarcer. Emigration to America still continues; but it is, for the most part, of a description of person who have afforded employ to others rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some property with them. Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States, there are twenty six persons belonging to one family, (Quakers, of the name of Thistlewaith,) lately residing in Meadow lane, Leeds. These industrious and enterprising individuals are gone with an intention of carrying on the woollen manufacture (in conjunction with others) on an extensive scale, either at Philadelphia or some other more eligible site in its vicinity. Several other families are preparing to emigrate from the same neighbourhood, as well as from Dewsbury, Bradford, and other places in the vicinity. It is true these extensive emigrations may, in some degree, contribute to relieve our overburdened population ; but they must likewise tend, in an equal ratio, to impoverish the nation ; as every individual and family who emigrate, setting aside the pecuniary wealth they carry with them, take what is of far more consequence to a commercial nation–their talents and industry–articles, at present, of comparative small value in the country. The very heavy impost which is at present levied upon authors and publishers, by being compelled, under the existing Copyright Act to deliver eleven copies of every book published to certain public libraries, is likely to be repealed by a Bill to be brought into Parliament in a few days. The body of evidence taken before the Select Committe of the House of Commons last year, forms a most interesting display of the state of literary property in this country. Saturday last Mr Stuart and Mr Allsop were returned for the Borough of Camelford. Yesterday, the Grand Jury for the County of Middlesex found two Bills of Indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury against five of the principal witnesses produced in behalf of the petitioner, who were examined before the Select Committee appointed to try the merits of the election fo Penrhyn. Extraordinary Legacy. –A very singular cause is now depending before the Court of Session in Scotland, respecting a legacy to the amount of upwards of fifty thousand pounds, bequeathed by the late Earl of F. (who died at Berlin) to a foreigner, who was one of his domestic servants. The payment of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the late Earl, on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consideration ; and from its novelty the case is, of course, the subject of much conversation in the Northern Metropolis. The arguments and pleadings in this extraordinary suit, in which the most eminent counsel of the Edinburgh Bar are engaged, display much classical as well as legal learning ; but no judgement has yet been pronounced by the Court. From the magnitude of the sum in dispute, it will probably be finally determined by an appeal to the House of Lords.– Morn. Chron. Town Hall, Southwark. –Thomas Wing was brought up by Reeve, the Marshalman, and examined before Sir John Earner[?], the sitting Magistrate, charged on suspicion of robbing his employers, Messrs Sentance and Flint, grocers, NO. 300. Borough, High-street. The prisoner's detection was caused in the following singular manner :–He was porter to the prosecutors, and was frequently about the shop ; a large house dog having seen him take money from the till, which he tied in his pocket handkerchief, followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a shed near the stables, and then he came into the shop and appeared quite restless, pulling every person by the skirt[?] and apparently wishing them to follow him. At length Henry Heydon, the apprentice, having occasion to go to the stable, the dog followed him, and having drawn his attention to the heap of rubbish, under which the money was buried, began to scratch at it till he brought the booty to view ! The apprentice brought it to his master, who counted, and found it to contain 12s. in copper coin. After marking it he desired the boy to place it in the same spot, which he did, and soon afterwards, finding that it was removed, he asked the prisoner some questions about it, but he declared his ignorance of the whole transaction. Reeve, the Marshalman, was then sent for, who, on searching the prisoner, found some of the marked ballpence[?] in his pocket.–Remanded. Bank Committee. –The Opposition Journals, last wek, asserted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House of Commons intend to report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of paying in specie. That is, the Bank shall pay next January in gold bars at the present price of gold, L.4 1s. per ounce, any quanitity of notes not being less than sixty or a hundred pounds' worth, and that in two years afterwards they shall pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold, L.3, 17s. 10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's plan goes farther. It recommends that the Bank shall never pay in coin, but in bars of gold, at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall at all times buy gold, when offered, at L.3, 17s. and sell it, when demanded, at L.3, 17s. 10 1/2d. If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the Restriction Committee intend to report in favour of payments in bullion at the market price ; and should Parliament adopt that plan ; then there will be a very great saving to the nation in the expense of coinage, the waste of, &c. All the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in foreign commerce, will be answered as well by payments in gold bars as by payments in coins, and the danger of a domestic run on the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic, as in 1797, will be completely prevented. This is, indeed, at all times, the only danger to which it is exposed. A run for coin on the Country Banks would instantly fall on the Bank of England, and would cramp, if not dry up,the currency throughout the empire, producing the greatest confusion. Now, if the Opposition Journals be correct, the currency will be placed in perfect security, at perfect ease. Nothing will be able to disorder it. If persons will hoard specie, they must purchase gold bars or foreign coin, or content themselves with silver. In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the amount of L.800,000 each year, and then the value of gold was rather below the standard price. In the year 1817 we imported to the amount of six millions, and in the year 1818 we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. During the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have an abundant harvest or two, and little importation of corn become necessary, gold will again fall very low. The Bank will then be able to pay, to buy gold to the full extent of Mr Ricardo's plan, and to place their notes on a firm, unquestionable foundation. The finances of the continent, and of the world, indeed–the sources and circulation of money will, during peace, gradually become steadier and better known. The East Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quantity of specie, while Spanish America, in consequence of her troubles, yields far less than usual. It would be madness to fly in the face of all these circumstances, by compelling the Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may be desirable to limit the issue of bank notes to some certain, yet liberal amount. We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the Committee ; but, if some rumours be true, we augur favourably of it. It[?] is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee, and stood alone in voting against the Report. Thus, then, the Report cannot be in favour of a very sudden or decided plan for the resumpion of cash payments, or Mr Tierney would not have voted against it ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable prospect of a rational scheme for that resumption, or the other five or six Opposition Members of the Committee would not have voted for it. – Courier. Grand Pigeon Match, three Gentlemen of the Midgham Club, against thrice of All England, took place on Monday on Farnham Downs, at twenty-one birds, twenty-one yards distance from the gun, for 150 guineas aside, charge unlimited. Messrs Adams, Russel and Holt, were selected from the Crack Club against Messrs King, Short and Keans. The sports were as follows ; Mr Adams killed nineteen birds, and the remaining two were severely hit. Russel killed eighteen, but lost one three yards out of bounds, and Mr Holt bagged sixteen, making a grand total of fifty-two from sixty-three. The Club was at first backed to win, but the England shots were now backed freely at six to four, as they were considered safe eighteen bird men. Mr King killed twenty, but lost two out of bounds. Short missed his first three, which brought betting to two to one onn the Club, but he killed the next seventeen, and missed the last bird. Mr Keans had seventeen to tie, and eighteen to win, and he was back at five to four and at two to one, after killing eleven birds in succession. He, however, missed the seventeenth, and had to kill the other four to win. He succeeded, and the prize was won by once bird. It was altogether the most interesting match of this sort known for years. Letters from Petersburgh, of the 15th ultimo, mention that Prince Gustavus of Sweden, son of King Gustavus IV., has obtained permission from the Emperor, his uncle, to proceed to England, for the purpose of completing his studies at Oxford. Reports speak highly of the virtues and talents of this unfortunate young Prince, who excites universal interest and sympathy in the north of Europe. In these feelings we must largely share, for we cannot easily forget the associations with which the name of Vasa was connected, not the services rendered by two Sovereigns of that Illustrious House to the cause of civil and religious liberty. It is said that a great Potentate, whose generosity and magnanimity are proverbial, has settled upon Prince Gustavus an allowance of L. 2,000 Sterling per annum, during the residence of the latter in England, and that on the return of his Royal Highness to the Continent he is to espouse his cousin, a Princess of Hesse Cassel, who, if rumour be correct, has lately refused a matrimonial alliance with the new Swedish dynasty. Papers arrivedon Saturday from New York and Boston to the 15th ult. The National Intelligencer, in an article occupying five columns, under the head of Strictures on Mr Lacock's Report on the Seminole War, defends the sanguinary proceedings of General Jackson. This production is said to have excited a great sensation throughout the United States, being supposed to express the sentiments of the Executive. The General had left Washington for his residence in Tenessee. By an arrival from Aux Cayes, intelligence was stated to be received that Sir G M'Gregor's troops had deserted him, owing to the want of funds for their subsistence.  ID316 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1793 	01 	07 	inform 	MONDAY, J AN. 7. By the Fanny, Capt. Bryen, arrived in twenty four days from New York, we have American papers, of which we give the following important intelligence:– It is an undoubted truth, (Strange as it may appear) that the Baron D'Carondolet, Governor of Louisiana, and Governor O'Neal, of Pensaco la, have opened the shores of the King of Spain, in West-Florida, to the Creeks and Cherokees, and delivered them arms and ammunition in abundance, advising and stimulating them to go to war against the frontier inhabitants of the United States, and that quickly, that now or never was the time, while the United States were engaged with the northern tribes. On the 30th of September, about midnight John Buchanan's station, four miles south of Nashville,) at which sundry families had collected, and fifteen gunmen) was attacked by a part of Creeks and Lower Cherokees, supposed to consist of three of our hundred. Their approach was suspected by the running of cattle, that had taken fright at them, and upon examination, they were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of the gate, and from the place and distance they received the first fire from the man who discovered them John M'Rocy. They immediately returned the fire, and continued a very heavy and constant firing upon the station, blockhouses surrounded with a stockade for an hour, and were repulsed with considerable loss, without injuring man, woman, or child, in the station. During the whole time of the attack, the Indians were never more distant than ten yards from the Block House, and often in large numbers close round the lower walls, attempting to put fire to it. One ascended the roof with a torch, where he was shot, and falling to the ground, renewed his attempts to fire the bottom logs, and was killed. The Indians fired 30 balls through a port hole of the over???ing, which lodged in the roof in the circumference of the bat, and those sticking in the walls on the outside are innumerable. Undoubted advices have been received that as early at the 18th of September, as many as 500 Creeks passed the Tennessee, and the lower Cherokee towns, and below, as on their way they decared to make war on Cumberland–and that they were joined by about 100 Cherokees of those towns.–This must have been the party that attacked Buchanan's station. Dreadful havoc was expected, but it is now hoped, that the check they have received will induce them to return without making further attempts upon that settlement. On the 3d instant. Black's Block House on the head of Crooked Creek, (a branch of Little River) at which there was a serjeant's command, of Cape, Crawford's company, was attacked, by surprise, about an hour and a half in the night, by a party of Indians, commanded by a Cherokee of Will's Town called the Tail, a brother of the Bench, and Talohteske, consisting of 3 other Cherokees and 5 Creeks. James Paul was killed in the knife, and George Morse and Robert Sharp, at a fire on the outside and John Shankland wounded, 3 horses were killed, and 7 taken off. These are the fruits of the advise of the Baron D'Carrondolet and Governor O'Neal; and it is due to Mr. Paton, their chief instrument, to add he has well acted his part!!! We hear from Fayetteville (North Carolina), that on Tuesday the 23d of October last a fire broke out in that town, owing to the negligence of a small negro girl, which consumed about 40 dwelling houses and stores, and 28 buildings of other descriptions.  ID317 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1792 	04 	27 	inform 	Richmond, January 28. Extract of a letter from a Gentleman now residing at Quebec, to his Correspondent in this City, dated Jan. 9, 1972 Our humanity was deeply affected by the dreadful carnage made by the Indians. You may be assured that the number of Indians did not exceed 1000, and that nothing saved General St. Clair, and the remainder of his army, but the great quantity of plunder he left to the Indians; they were composed of various tribes, and three-fourths of of them remained in the camp to plunder it, and to take scalps, the trophies of their victory; and he that got most when he returned to his nation, acquired the greatest share of glory; hence only about 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is under 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they have obtained at so easy a purchase, and the riches they obtained by the plunder, and the provisions they found, will make them a more terrible foe than ever they have been; they boast of taking an amazing quantity of powder and arms, which they wanted; many of them were only armed with spears and hatchets, and I have no doubt but if another expedition should be set on foot, that they will be met by three times the number of Indians. The indian tribes of nations who live many hundred miles back have all entered into an association, and made the present war a common concern, they to oppose what they call the common enemy. The warriors of the different tribes so united are not less than 15 or 20,000; numbers of the chiefs of ten or twelve numerous nations were here last summer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make peace, and offered his mediations; he told them he was at peace with the United States, and could give them no assistance. Their answer was, that the enemy was in their country, and would not make peace with them, but on term dishonourable, and at the expense of their country, and that they had determined to die before they would accept of such terms. They felt much dissatisfied with the answer they received, and departed with a full determination to defend their country with the last of their blood. You may depend on it, that many years will elapse, and many thousand men be expended before the United States will, by the present measures, be able to possess the country in contest; and I may also add, that I have great apprehensions, that desolation and destruction will be the consequence on the frontiers of the Ohio this winter and next spring; I would to God some steps might be taken to prevent them. I have no doubt the country might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the expence already incurred by the different expeditions; the attempt to take the country from them by force, is founded in unrighteousness, and ought to be abandoned; besides, if the American mean to have anytrade with them, they are taking steps that will prevent it for many years to come. The Indians do not easily forget or forgive injuries Carlisle, Jan. 4. 1792. By the Pittsburgh post which arrived yesterday, we are informed, that previous to his leaving Pittsburgh, an express had arrived there with the melancholy news that Forts Jefferson and Franklin were taken by Indians, and that two large bodies of them were moving to the Allighany. Extract of a Letter from Patowmack, North Amer ca, Feb. 7. Last Sunday evening came to this town a young man from Cat-fish, which he left about two weeks ago, and who gave us the following pleasing interesting, and important intelligence, viz, that two days before he left Cat-fish, two men arrived there from Licking, who informed, that they had been out with a body of 1300 volunteers on horseback from Kentucky, under General Scott; that they left Licking on the expedition a few days before Christmas; that General Scott dispatched three spies in advance, who, when they arrived about 13 miles beyond the spot where General St. Clair was defeated they discovered a large body of Indians diverting and enjoying themselves with the plunder they had taken, riding the bullocks, dancing, &c. and appeared to be mostly drunk; that on the information being given to General Scott, who, with the main body, were a few miles in the rear, he divided them into three divisions, advanced, and fell on the enemy by surprise; that the contest was short, but victorious, on the side of the volunteers, 700 of the enemy being killed on the spot, all the cannon and stores in their possession retaken, and the remainder of that savage body put to flight; that General Scott, having lost but six men, returned to Licking in triumph, with most of the cattle, stores, &c. leaving the cannon at Fort Jefferson; that General Scott had previously gone out with 400 men, but finding his number was insufficient, was returning but met a body of 900 volunteers when, upon joining him, he immediately proceeded in prosecution of his original design which fortunately proved successful. Our informant further adds, that he saw a Kentucky newspaper of the 8th of January, at Morgan Town, brought by Major Scott's expedition, which corresponded with that given by the two men at Cat Fish, and that Gen. Scott brought in near 700 scalps.  ID321 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	11 	05 	inform 	The Indian Chiefs lately arrived in town are six in number. They have been indiscriminately styled Cherokees, but three of them only are of that nation, and three are Creek Indians.–They are all handsome men, not exceeding in age twenty - five or twenty-six. These six Chiefs have 20,000 warriors ready to take the field, and have the strongest wish to act in conjunction with the English. They travelled 3000 miles before the reached Halifax, and were near 12 months in performing the journey. From Halifax they went in an English frigate to Quebec to Lord Dorchester, by whom they were sent over to England to concert their plans in person with the Ministry. The object of their coming to this country may be easily guessed at. They long to make an attack upon the Spanish settlements. One of them was heard last night in the playhouse to say, he hoped in six months from this time to be in the heart of Mexico.  ID322 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	11 	08 	inform 	When hostilities are once commenced, a for fidable armament will unquestionable be sent against the Spanish South American colonies. Of its success there cannot be a doubt, when we shall be aided by an army of 20,000 Indian warriors, beside the active support of those Mexicans now ??? under the tyranous yoke of Spain. So determined are the Cherokees, the Creeks, and other nations of Indians in the Southern parts of America, to strip the Spaniards of their possessions on that Continent, that they will unquestionably attempt the glorious achievement, even though the policy of this country should prevent us from lending them effectual assistance. The rich silver mines at Potosi, in Peru, were accidentally discovered in 1545, by an Indian, as he was clambering up the mountain, in pursuit of a Lama, which had strayed from his flock. Soon after, the mines, of Sacotecas, in New Spain, little inferior to the other in value, were opened. From that time successive discoveries have been made in both colonies, and silver mines are now so numerous that the working of them, and of some few mines of gold in the provinces of Terra Firm, and the new Kingdom of Grenada, has become the capital occupation of the Spaniards, and is reduced into the system no less complicated than interesting.  ID323 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	11 	08 	inform 	Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Muskingum to his Friend in the City of Norwich, (Connecticut,) dated Nov. 24, 1790. The prospect of peace from our frontiers, seems to me to be vanished for the present; the troops from this garrison have this morning returned, and the best account I can collect of the expedition is as follows: viz. the troops amounting to about 1200 militia, and about 300 regulars, after seventeen days march from Miami, reached the great Miami village, about 170 miles, without any molestation, except having a number of their pack-horse stole.–On their arrival they found the village deserted, and all the valuable builder a short tarry, they proceeded to neighings set on flames by the Indians. Afbouring villages, without molestation, and deftroyed five of them, and a quantity of corn, computed at fifteen thousand bushels, which they found buried in different places, and very large quantities of vegetables of every kind. The first opposition that was met with, a party of about 150 Kentucky militia, and thirty regular troops, all under the command of Col. Hardin, of Kentucky, were detached from the main body, lying in the great Miami village, to pursue the track of a party of Indians which had the day before been discovered. After a pursuit of about six miles, they came up with, and were attacked by surprise, by a body of Indians, who were concealed in the thickets on every side of a large plain; and on the first onset the militia, without exchanging a single fire, made a most precipitate retreat, and left the regular troops to stand the whole charge of the Indians; the conflict was short and bloody; the troops were soon overpowered by numbers, and all fell, except the two offiers and two or three privates, after defending themselves at their bayonet points with the greatest possible obstinacy. Ensign Hartshorn, of Franklin, was one of the four that escaped, and his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat, and by that means screening himself from the eye of his pursuers, that from any other circumstance. Captain Armstrong, who commanded the party, likewise made his escape, by plunging himself into a pond or swamp, up to his neck, within two hundred yards of the field of action, where he remained the whole night, as a spectator of the horrid scene of the War Dance, performed over the dead and wounded bodies of the poor soldiers that had fallen the preceding day, where their shrieks, mixed with the horrid yells of the savages, rendered his situation shocking. After this, some few skirmishes succeeded, but nothing material, until the second capital action, which happened two days after the army left the Miami village. At ten miles distance from the town, the General ordered a halt, and detached from four to five hundred militia, and about sixty regular soldiers, commanded by Major Wylls, all under the command of Col. Harden, with orders to march back to the town. On their first entrance into the town, there appeared a small body of Indians, who immediately fled at the first onset, and by that means decoyed the whole body of militia, by making their flight into different directions, and encouraging the militia to pursue; by this means the regular troops were left alone, and the Indians had effected their design; for the moment they found the small handful of regular troops detached from the main body of militia, they commenced the attack with their whole force, excepting the flying parties that had diverted the militia; and although they soon found some part of the militia returning on their back, pursued their object of routing and destroying the troops; as the only sure plan of success; which, after the bloody conflict on each side, they effect. The regular troops, all to nine, including two commissioned officers, were killed and disabled, and a total defeat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls, of Hartford, and Lieut. Frothingham, of Middletown. Of the militia, it is said, about an hundred were killed, among whom were a number of brave and valuable characters. The Indians, it appears, from some cause, did not think it prudent to pursue their successes from the field of action, for most of the troops that were not killed, or sorely wounded, made their escape, which they never could have done had the Indians pursued with their usual fury. Nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the Indians on this occasion; the militia they appeared to despise, and with all the undautedness conceivable, threw down their guns, and rushed upon the bayonets of the regular soldiers; a great number of them fell; but being so far superior in numbers soon overpowered them, for while the poor soldier had his bayonet in one Indiaman, two more would sink their tomahawks in his head. The defeat of our troops was complete, the dead and wounded were left on the field in possession of the savages. No damage, of any consequence, has been sustained in this part of the country from the Indians; but what effect the expedition may have on us, as relates to our frontier, it uncertain.– If the Western Indians have any idea of treating for peace, we shall be safe; if not, we are much exposed.  ID324 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	01 	21 	inform 	Extract of a letter from Norfolk (Virginia), Oct. 26. We learn from the West Country, that the Kentucky Convention has determined in favour of a separation, and large preparations are making in the country for offensive operations against the Indians, who have committed so many murders, and harassed the country so much, that it can no longer be endured. Such devastation may shortly be expected to take place,that the name of a Shawenese nation will be no more. that on this side the Cumberland mountains, please prospects are in view; a general peace is likely to take place with the Southern Tribes; a regular and efficient system of government is about being established under the auspices of Congress: one of the mildest seasons in a temperate and salubrious climate, with the most exuberantharvest, gives joy to the husband, and animates the diligence and industry of all. Extract of a letter from a Gentleman on the Ohio. Since my last, the Gentlemen I mentioned to you are forming themselves into a Company, for the purpose of building three vessels of force, amounting from twenty to forty 24 pounders, completely manned and quipped. They purpose loading with tobacco, flour, &c. and proceed tos ea by the gulph of Mexico, with a full determination to punish severely every insult which, in violation of treaties, may be offered to the American flag, sailing down the Mississippi. It is generally supposed they will embark between twelve and fifteen hundred men, in orto???

Wednesday, Dec. 8. The SPEECH of George Washington , Esq; President of the Congress, on??? the ??? Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and House of Representatives, I N meeting you again, I feel much satisfac tion on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty, and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad, as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes, have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing, as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources, but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add, as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary. In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session, a loan of 3,000,,000 of florins, towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place, has been completed in Holland.–As well theexchange with which it has been filled, as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing, created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers, may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information. Since your last sessions, I have received communication, by which it appears, that the district of Kentucke, at present a part of Virginia, has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state, in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted, will be found to do great honour to both the par ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government, expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke, cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare, to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you. It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These, with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash, have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and, being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes, and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities, or afford them a retreat for their prisoners, and plunder, they have, instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States, renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed, and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking, whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity. These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements, that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes, than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures, it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition, in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me, The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded, as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended. The disturbed situation of Europe, and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers, whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States, reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war, and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country, to abridge in means, and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections, how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies, by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms, which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce, offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil. Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us, that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection. The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system, have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom, whether improvement of a judicatory system, have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom, whether im provements in that system may yet be made, and particularly whether??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts, be not desirable through all the States. The patronage of our commerce, of our merchants and seamen, has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them, either by express convention, or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too, with his most Christian Majesty, has stipulated in certain cases, the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect. The establishment of the Militia, of a Mint, of Standards of Weights and Measures, of the Post Office and Post Roads, are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course, and which are abundantly urged by their own importance. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives, The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated, leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope, that it will be a favourite policy with you, not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded, but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit, to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject, and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute, along with other means, to the actual reduction of the public debt, the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest, as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents. Gentlemen of the Senate, and House of Representatives. In perusing the various and weighty business of the present session, I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom, and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty, you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both, and our best reward, if by a successful administration of our respective trusts, we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens, and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence. (Signed) GEORGE WASHINGTON. United States, Dec. 8 1790.  ID330 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	01 	07 	entertain 	New-York Oct. 11. We are informed that the census of Philadelphia is completed, and that the city is found to contain fifty three thousand inhabitants. A Petersburgh (Virginia) paper of the 30th ult. informs the public of that state, that a serious petition is now drawing up, to be presented to the next congress, stating arguments in favour of polygamy, from the plain principles of reason; and praying that a man may legally marry two wives. This, it is thought, will be the most effectual means to extirpate the numerous race of old maids, and increase the population of the United States. The petition is to be presented by a gentleman residing at Cabin Point. Oct 12. In one of the Charleston papers of the 16th ult. appears the epistle from the yearly meeting of the Quakers in London, to the friends in Great Britain, Ireland and America. It is remarkable that in the re-publication of this episstle in the Carolina paper, the whole paragraph relative to theslave trade and negro slavery is omitted. Oct. 13. The ship Betsy, Rook, arrived on the 6th instant, at Wilmington, Delaware,, from Londonderry, in Ireland. This vessel brought in a large number of Irish emigrants, some of them people of property; who, weary of the patronage of their old tutelar saint, St. Patrick, have come to settle themselves and their posterity in America, under the more liberal auspices of St. Tammany. The following letter was written from a young heir to the Probate Judge–Sir–My father departed this life not long hence, and has left a widow and five scorpions. I understand he died deetested and made me executioner, but as the estate is like to prove insolent, I was told that as you was Judge of reprobates, you must send me a letter of condemnation. And as in duty bound ??? ??? pray, &c. Extract of a letter from a gentleman, in the county of Lincoln, Massachusets, dated Sept. 14. We have had a very wet season here since you went from us, and the grass hoppers are innumerable; they have eat up all the gardens, and all the grass; of course, as the natural consequences, we have no milk, neither shall we have any beef or butter this season; the corn has also suffered very much from those insects Extract of a letter from Banbury (Georgia) Sept. 20 A firm peace being now, to all appearance, secured between the United States and the Creek Indians, we may reasonable expect that the state of Georgia will soon begin to feel the good effects. The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value, and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men, who instead of being mere lookers on, in quality of overseers and drivers, would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe, and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw, is one of the most beautiful you can imagine,abounding with everything that can make life comfortable, besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of Sapola, with rather more water than that of Charleston. Several vessels are hourly looked for from France, (one in particular of 800 tons from Bourdeaux) to load with live oak ship timber and??? in the river of St. Mary's. Extract of a letter from Hampton (Virginia) Sept. 25. There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river, the exportations of which, in the opinion of rational men, ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals, and clays for the several colours of paint, which may be had in any quantity, and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal, from every discovery we have been able to make, are inexhaustible; all the samples, however, that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface, and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand, there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe, and at a much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints, there are none better in the world, and in quantity, when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river, of property and enterprize, are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature, it is thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their attention. Extract of a letter from Charleston, Sept. 27. On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard, Hubcaw, a fine new brig, calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice, the property of Mr. Hary Grant, and is to be called the Pringle. A number of spectators collected from the city to view the pleasing sight, with which they were no less delighted, than with the liberal en tertainment and polite attention of Mr. O???. Boston, Sept. 28. Yesterday sailed from this port, the ship Columbia, Capt. Robert Gray, on a circum navigation voyage to the North-West coast of America.–This is the second voyage the Columbia has made to our coast–too much praise cannot be given to the gentlemen, owners of the ship, for their exertion in extending the commerce of America. The native of??? has returned to the place of its nativity. Dr. FRANKLIN Never declare yourself the author of a???, without being, beyond doubt, certain of???, was the Doctor's advice. He generally enforced his percepts by giving an example. I had been with a number of my acquaintance taking the diversion of a dance at an inn. The fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the tavern keeper came in and advised us in a very warm manner to make a collection for the fiddler who had been scraping his cat gut several hours in our service; we apparently agreed, and he well pleased with the success of his persuasion, went for his hat to collect what we were willing to give. We took up an old newspaper, tore it into small pieces, which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern keeper goes round the room, and we, very gravely, drop our paper in his hat. The fiddler returns, and the landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self approbation, boasts of what he had been doing for him; It was I persuaded them to make the collection, I made them give, I went round to every one, and see what I have got. If it had not been for me–the fiddler examines his prize, and discovers the cheat–he vents all his anger upon the poor landlord's shoulders, who thus suffered for proclaiming himself the author of a project before its success was fully ascertained.  ID333 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	06 	24 	inform 	The Indians, on the borders of Kentucky, continue to commit the most horrible acts of cruelty upon such unfortunate Americans as fall in their power. The burning of the Miami villages, and the destruction of their corn and vegetables, instead of intimidating those ferocious savage, have made them more and more vindictive and restless; and being acquainted with all the passes in the country, they bid defiance to their pursuers, whom they frequently surprise and cut off.  ID334 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	01 	10 	inform 	From the New York Journal. Winchester, Oct. 20. By recent intelligence from Kentucky we learn that a short time ago an American vessel was seized at New Orleans, and her cargo disposed of by the Spaniards. Also, that the troop which went out against the Indians had, not far from the banks of the Ohio, fallen in with about forty of them, whom they made their prisoners, after a slight resistance; and that having washed them, 15 turned out to be white men. Philadelphia, Nov 9. We hear from undoubted authority, that a considerable loan has been negotiated in Holland for the service of these United States. Albany, Nov. 4. The Legislature of Vermont have resolved to pay to the State of New York 30,000 dollars, agreeably to the first proposition contained in the declaration of the Commissioners of this State, appointed to declare the consent of the Legislature thereof, that a certain territory within the jurisdiction of the State of New York be erected into a new State on the 17th of October last; in consequnece whereof, all rights and titles to lands within the State of Vermont, under grants of the late colony of New York, or from the State of New York (except such grants as were intended as confirmations of those from New Hampshire) cease and determine. The Legislature have also resolved, that a Convention be called for taking into consideration the constitution of the United States; the members to be elected in December, and the Convention to Meet the first week in Jauary. The Legislature have adjourned to meet again on the first Thursday in January, for the purpose (we suppose) of choosing Senators, and affixing the time and manner of electing Representatives for Congress. New York, Nov. 18. The following resolution has passed the House of Representatives of the State of Virginia now in session: Resolved, That so much of this act, entitled, An Act, making provision for the provision for the debt of the United States in their redemption of the public debt, is dangerous to the rights, and subversive of the interest of the people; and demands the marked disapprobation of the General Assembly. Portland, Nov. 15. The stone work of the light house, at the entrance of our harbour, is now completed. On Tuesday the 9th instant, the last stone was laid by Mr. Nichols, of this town, master builder. The work is extremely well executed. The lighthouse is now 70 feet high. To this the lanthorn, which is to be six feet in diameter, will add about 15 feet, 85 feet in whole. The lanthorn is now preparing, and will probably be raised and lighted by the first of next month. Baltimore, Nov. 23. A society of respectable gentlemen of this place have raised an adequate fund for the establishment of an extensive manufacture of gunpowder, and the necessary mill-works will be speedily erected in the vicinity of this town. This important insituation will not only prove highly advantageous to this State and town, but may, if properly encouraged, become a national benefit. York (Pennsylvania), Nov 10. From Wright's Ferry we learn, that about four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, as a boat was coming from the East side, a most tremendous storm arose when she was about half way over, by which means she was soon filled with water, and sunk. there was six passengers and the??? in her (besides a small light waggon and three horses, viz. a clergyman, the owner of the waggon, with his wife and three children; when the storm came on, the woman and children took shelter in the waggon, but it continued to blow with such violence that the waggon was torn out of the boat, and the body having by chance got loose from the carriage, and being pretty tight, floated some distance till its progress was stopped by a rock; the husband, viewing the melancholy situations of his wife and children, resolved to relieve or perish with them, and quitting the boat swam to the waggon, cut open the cover with his knife, and with difficulty kept their heads above water till they were relieved by a boat from the West side; by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappeared; the Clergyman just as he found the boat sinking mounted his horse, one of the boatmen mounted on one of the waggon horses, and by this means preserved themselves till they were relieved by a boat; the other boatman of the name of Tim Sulivan, depending on his skill in swimming got up an oar, but it is thought he is drowned, as he has not since been heard of; the boat was found in the falls, and one of the waggon horses that had been given up for lost, was found next day some distance below the falls, with all his geers on, and does not appear to have received the least injury. Extract of a letter from Sunbury, Northumberland County (Pennsylvania), dated Nov. 13. One of the men who murdered the Indians at Pine Creek, was tried on Saturday evening, and though a number of witnesses clearly proved the hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed, and the confession of his counsel at the bar that confirmed it, yet, notwithstanding an express charge from the judges to bring him in guilty, the jury in a few moments returned with a verdict in his favour, and a subscription to pay the costs of the suit, that he might be immediately set at liberty; and all this from a most absurd idea, which the Attorney General, with all his endeavours, could not beat out of them, that the crime was not the same to kill an Indian as a white man: for some minuets the Chief Justice was mute with astonishment. How the State can pacify the Indians now, Heaven knows, while at this moment the other murderers are at large in this country, and no one will arrest them.  ID335 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	05 	09 	inform 	Halifax, April 6. The late violent rains have done much damage in the country:–The bridge at Sackville is nearly torn down, and the Mill there is much injured: the Bridge at Nine Mills River is partly carried away; and the different roads and causeways are supposed to have suffered more than 2000l. will repair. Since the retreat of the f–eral troops, under General Harmar, the Miami Indians have committed unparalleled cruelties. A large body of them, on the 2d of February, attacked the settlements called Big Bottom, twenty miles from Harman, on the Muilsingam, which they entirely destroyed. Eleven men and two children were massacred, two escaped and three were taken prisoners. Boston. The amount of the value of theexports from the United States, for thirteen months, agreeable to an estimate made at the Office of the Treasury, in 20,000,000 dollars. The greatest apprehensions are entertained of an invasion from our savage neighbours; as accounts from Philadelphia state, that there has been a confederation of all the South West Indians to fall on our frontiers early in the spring. Similiar apprehensions have driven the inhabitants in the country of Marcetta, from their plantations into the city, where they do military duty. According to the late Census, the number of inhabitants in this commonwealth is 470,000. Philadelphia, April 7. Congress met here to-day and made a house, Articles of the Constitution, that were not liked by many of us, are altered much for the better– among other things, we were dissatisfied that not any notice was taken of Religion, as we wanted it expressly declared, that not any sect should ever be established in preference to another.–This is now done. In this part of the world we know not any thing of Toleration–all are equally free. It is said we have land for upwards of an hundred millions of people; we are yet about three, so that,for sometime we have have not any great cause to fight for territory.  ID336 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	05 	13 	inform 	The Indian war in America is now become an object of considerable importance, by the junction of several tribes of Indians, hitherto??? with those already engaged in it. General Washington is expected to take the command of the army intended to serve against them in the present summer.  ID337 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1792 	04 	20 	inform 	Letters dated Halifax, Feb 7, brought by the Schooner Joseph, arrived at Glasgow, say, the Indians have beat the Americans in a second action, in which 48 officers and 800 men were killed of the American army, besides the loss of all their field pieces, arms and stores. since this battle, the Indians are increasing, and become very powerful.  ID338 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1792 	04 	23 	inform 	Abstract of American Finances, as laid before Congress, January 23, by Alexander Hamilton, Esq; Secretary to the Treasury of the United States. Revenue.

That M'Gilvray, and his army of savages, after an unsuccessful and bloody engagement, had fled to the woods, where the General left them, and returned to Savannah.– This expedition was undertaken about the beginning of March, winch has been crowned with the expected catastrophe, and though the Cherokee, Miami, and Chiquesaw tribes, may mediate revenge at some future period; it is not likely they will be in a condition to disturb the settlers for some years to come.  ID342 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	07 	12 	inform 	Letters from Alexandria, in Virginia, dated the 9th May last, mention, that General Wayne had been dispatched, in the beginning of March, on an expedition against the Cherokee Miamis and Chickesau Indians, who have, for some time past, had as their chief warrior, one Macgillivray, a Scotchman, who has long resided among these Indians. General Wayne, at the head of two thousand Provincials, had completely routed them after a great slaughter. After the battle, Macgillivray and his savages took refuge in the woods. General Wayne has destroyed the most part of the habitation of these Indians in the extent of 200 English miles along the river, which is the boundary of Georgia, after which he returned to Savannah. This defeat is so total, that it will put it out of the power of these Indians to be again troublesome to the State of Virginia.  ID343 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	06 	18 	persuade 	The American States having now gained their independence, have no cause of quarrel let with this country; but matters are very different between them and Spain. It is well known, that the Indians on the back settlements have been regularly supplied with arms and ammunition from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies, to enable them to distress the Americans, and prove at least a hindrance to their growing prosperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi has been denied them?and the Spaniards, now in possession of the Floridas, have been continually quarrelling with them about their boundaries. It may therefore be considered as almost certain, that the American states will take an active part against Spain. This will be a great acquisition to Britain in every point of view; for though American cannot furnish money, she can furnish men and provisions; and afree intercourse with her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the security of our West-India Islands. Their privateers, too, will be able to take their runs so speedily, that the Spanish trade must be very materially injured thereby.  ID349 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1791 	07 	25 	entertain 	Norfolk, April 11. This day arrived the ship Albion, John Simmons, master, in 47 days from Rotterdam; on the 8th lying to in a heavy gale of wind, the Albion shipped a sea, which carried away all her boats and every loose article from the deck; there were three men of the watch, one of whom is washed overboard and perished– his name is John M'Naught, and belonged to Greenock. Extract of a letter from a gentleman at the falls of the Ohio, to his relation inWinchester, Virginia. dated April 13, 1791. I wrote to you from Fort Pitt, which place we left the 3d. inst. in company with two other boats, and proceeded to Limestone, without meeting or apprehending danger–at that place we were informed of several disasters which had befallen boats going down the river, and one to a boat going up to a French station, loaded with bacon, butter, &c. The particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians, and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing, they gave the Indian whoop, and rushing on the flankets, scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat, but did no damage, as it required some time to make their way into the river. After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity, they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days, five or six boats happened to come down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them, in which were two young ladies, of the name Macdonald, a young gentleman, and some others, passengers, and took it. Elevated with this easy capture, they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight, which they attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes, each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat, as it came down, and commenced firing; after discharging their guns, they retreated, loading and came on a second time, fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on, there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat, which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two were killed, and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat, and prevent the Indians from boarding it, which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ???, they threw billets of wood at them, and one of them took up an ax, as a weapon of defence, should they persist in boarding, which the Indians perceiving, and, as is supposed, their ammunition being expended, they retreated, without accomplishing their object. These inhuman monsters, previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat, placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes, in which situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction, they fired at another boat, and killed one young man. In short, every boat tat has gone down the river lately, has been fired at, except our's. We saw no Indians; the places where the above depredation happened we passed in the night. Boston, May 4. It is supposed that the adventures of the town of Boston, lost 25,000 dollars in the late lottery; besides 'wear and tear' of conscience. Salem, May 31. His excellency our worthy overnor perceiving, with his usual discernment, that Lotteries have a tendency to withdraw the people's attention from industry, the only certain source of wealth and prosperity; and also that they operate as a??? ??? ???, ??? ??? and embarrassed being??? the ??? a venturers; suggests, in??? ??? the Legislature, the propriety of discontinuing this mode of raising money. The states of Connecticut and New Hampshire have passed laws, prohibiting the sale of lottery tickets of other states, in their states. Bennington, May 30. A gentleman from the northward informs, that the part at the British post lately holden in this state, has recently been recalled. Baltimore, May 27. Colonel Jacob Webb, and Captain Miller, formerly of Stamford, in Concecticut, Mr. John Carmel, of Philadelphia, merchant, and several other gentlemen, with a negro boy, were drowned, on the 9th of March last, in St. Mary's river (Georgia) occasioned by the oversetting of a boat, in a sudden flaw of wind. Boston, May 25. On Friday last, the venerable Mr. John Simonds, of Salem, entered the one hundredth year of his age. He is the only male person who has arrived at that great age from the first settlement of the town by the English, in 1629, to the present day. New York, June 9. General Washington, on his tour to the Southern Sates, landed at Charlestown, South Carolina, in a barge decorated for the purpose, with colours and pendants, and rowed by twelve American Captains and a Cockswain, all dressed in blue silk jackets, black silk breeches, white stockings, and blue roses to their shoes. They had likewife hold laced hats; with silk bandeaus, with the motto, Long live the President. An immense number of people assembled near the Quay, and on board the vessels in the river, which, as well as works, saluted him with several discharges of artillery. The day was afterwards devoted to conviviality–The lodge of St. John addressed his Excellency as follows:– Right Worshipful Sir, We the Master, Officers and Members of St. John's Lodge, No. 2 of Newbern, beg leave to hail you welcome with three times three ! We approach you not with the language works have proved you to be the true and faithful Brother, the skilful and expert Craftsmen, the just and upright Man. But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to express with sufficient energy, the cordial warmth with which our bosoms glow towards you–We therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and devoutly pray, that the Providence of the Most High, may strengthen, establish and protect you in your walk through life–and when you are called off from your terrestrial labours, by command of our divine grand master, and your operations sealed with the mark of his approbation, may your soul be everlastingly refreshed with the streams of living water which flow from the right hand of God. And when the Supreme Architect of all world's shall collect his most precious jewels, as ornaments of the Celestial Jerusalem–may you eternally shine among those of the brightest lustre. To which the President returned the following answer:– Gentlemen, I receive the cordial welcome which you are pleased to give me, with sincere gratitude. My best ambition having aimed at the unbiassed approbation of my fellow citizens, it is peculiarly pleasing to find my conduct so affectionately approved,, by a fraternity whose association is founded on justice and benevolence. In reciprocating the kind wishes contained in your address, be persuaded, that I offer a sincere prayer for your present and future happiness. George-Town. April 30. Yesterday morning, about one or two o'clock, the ship Termagant, belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen, lying in the stream opposite this town, was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected, but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board, the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction, and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting, store and dwelling houses, on the water side, were prevented from sharing a similar fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse, the property of Francis and Charles Loundes, situated at some distance from the water, wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stored, was several times, in different places, on fire, ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss, occasioned by this alarming element, must be great indeed, as the ship was large and nearly new; besides, there were goods to a considerable amount, and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the money, which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin, which by some means or other, set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost. Pittsburgh, May 21. A letter received in this town, on Sunday last, from Lieut. Jeffers, at Fort Franklin, mentions, that an Indian had arrived there, who brought him intelligence that 300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations had set out for war and that they were determined to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio, near Petersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing, but their destination was not known.  ID351 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1792 	08 	17 	inform 	By private letters and newspapers lately arrived from Philadelphia and New York we have informmation, that the Indians are carrying on their depredations on the back settlements of the United States with great vigour; that an enquiry as to the miscarriage of the war had been made by Congress, and an army was collected this year; that the Americans had some expectations of getting free of the Indian war by treaties. We have advices of Governor Clinton's being re-elected Governor of New York state by a majority of 180, but the friends of Mr. Tay were objecting to the return, as the canvassers had not opened the boxes which contained the returns from three counties, Otsego, Clinton, and Tioga, which if opened they say would have given the election to Mr. Tay, the county of Otsego alone being 300 majority in favours of Mr. Tay. A dreadful storm happened at New York on the 1st of July, which continued with so much violence, that several vessels were driven from their moorings, and a number of boats upset and many lives lost.  ID352 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1792 	08 	20 	inform 	Extract of a letter from New York,??? A complete overthrow has lately been given to a numerous body of Indians, commanded by one of their greatest Warriors, who was left dead on the field, amongst many hundreds of his followers. The attack was commenced on the morning of the 28th of June, by a company of Regulars under the command of Lieutenant Morton of New York, aided by a number of the neighbouring inhabitants; and after a contest of three hours, put them totally to the rout. The carnage was general amongst the Indians, and no quarter given, as it might operate as a terror in future to those savage Freebooters, whose depredations on the property of every description of individuals and oftentimes??? with personal cruelty to those in their power, has exasperated the Communities to the highest pitch of vengeance and retaliation when an opportunity offered.  ID353 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1792 	12 	14 	inform 	Extract of a letter from Philadelphia, dated Nov. 1. Advice received from Governor Blount, dated the latter end of September, informs us, that the Cherokees of the five lower towns on the Tenesee, headed by John Watts and Esquaka, or the bloody fellow, has declared war against the United States, and that the warriors, according to various authentic accounts, amount to near 600, including about one hundred banditti Creeks; another letter mentions that the above force had actually set out on some expedition against the frontiers; it is feared they will fall first on Cumberland settlement.  ID354 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1792 	10 	08 	entertain 	Extract of a letter from Luxene County. On Saturday the 1st of July, I left Tioga point, near the middle of the day; about half after one o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising from the north west, and I had scarcely time to take shelter in the house of Obadiah Gore, Esq; at Sheshequen, before the storm came on, attended with heavy thunder and lightening, and a violent gale of wind with rain. The storm continued up wards of half an hour, during which time to see the tumbling of timber during the storm, was surprising. After it abated I continued on my journey, but found it very difficult travelling in many places, the road being blocked up by the falling of timber. I reached Wilksbarree on Wednesday. It appears that the storm extended through the country, and at the same hour of the day, blew more violent in some places than others. At Exeeter, about nine miles from Wilksbarrie, a level plain loaded with pitch pine timber, was swept of its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile in length, and three fourths of a mile wide, being either torn up by the roots or twisted off, leaving their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high. A number of buildings in different parts of the country stript of their roofs, and otherways damaged–fences in many place removed, and many fields of corn, others grain and flax laid level with the earth–cattle killed by the falling of timber in every part of the country. A Mr. –Lot, who lived at Mahooper, about 35 miles from Wilksbarre, whose family consisted of his wife and a number of children– he with his wife being absent children seeing themselves in danger in the house, left it at the instant a large tree was falling; the tree reached them a small distance from the door, and a girl about eleven years of age was crushed to pieces about expired instantly. One of the other children had a thigh and both arms broke, another badly wounded in the head–these two it is feared has received the fatal blow, two other slightly wounded. Extract of a letter from Richmond, Virginia, dated July 28. By accounts from Kentucky we are informed, that about the 1st of this month a party of Indians appeared near Frankfort, and took a great number of horses and negroes. Col. M'Dowell with 300 men pursued them to the Ohio; but not falling in with them he crossed the river, leaving 100 men to take care of his horses; after marching about 12 or 15 miles, overtook a large party, when a severe engagement ensued, but being overpowered by numbers, was obliged to retreat. He then sent for the men left behind, and came up with the Indians the next day, and after engaging some time, obliged them to make a precipitate retreat. Col. M'Dowell took six Indian warriors, two Englishmen and a Frenchman from Detroit, and all the negroes and horses. Newtown, June 27. On the 13th instant the meeting house in Newtown, was removed about eight rods, the removal was effected in one hour and an half, after previous preparations for the purpose had been made. The house is between 70 and 80 feet long, and about 50 feet wide, with a steeple at one end; the whole of which was removed entire, with the least injury to any part.  ID366 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1794 	01 	24 	inform 	Letters from Quebec, dated Nov. 17, say, that every thing was quiet in that province. Some letters from Quebec were on Saturday received at the General Post Office, which state that the American army under the command of General Wayne had been routed by the Otoway Indians; an advanced party of 200 men had been entirely cut off: his army consisted of 400 regulars and 2,000 volunteers.  ID377 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1794 	07 	18 	inform 	Philadelphia, June 3. [ Authentic.] Copy of a letter from General Wilkins, to Col. C. Biddl, dated Pittsburgh, 23 d May, 1794. I this moment received yours of the 17th inst. I arrived about fifteen minutes ago from Le Boeuf, and left the detachment there well covered, and in good spirits. They have built, under my directions, two small block-houses, picketed in, which I think will render them sufficiently strong until the reinforcement goes under Capt. Denny. The Indians I have conversed with still continue of the opinion that the British will make an opposition to the establishment at Presque Isle. There arrived at Cuslawago, while I was there, an Indian from Sandusky, where he had been left by the Senecas last fall sick;ߝhe says the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, M'Kee, and Elliot the Indian agent, (the two last refugees from this country) were visiting all the Indian towns in that quarter, and exciting them to continue their opposition to the Americans, and assuring them of support from their father the British monarch. He further adds that they were ready for fighting Gen. Wayne the moment he moved; and that the British were erecting garrisons at the Miami river. Heconfirms the accounts of the other Indians, that they were determined to oppose the establishment at Presque Isle. There were in the Port of Philadelphia on the 25th of May. 62 Ships, 73 Brigs, 7 Snows, 60 Schooners, 42 Sloops. 244 In the House of Representatives of the United States, Thursday June 5, 1794. The House, according to the order of the day, resolved itself into a committee of the whole House, on the report of the Committee, to whom was referred the remonstrance of the People west of the Alleghany Mountains, relative to the navigation of the river Mississippi, and after some time spent therein, Mr. Speaker resumed the chair, and Mr. Trumbull reported, that the Committee, according to order, had the same report under consideration, and come to a resolution thereupon, which he delivered in at the Clerk's table, where the same was twice read, and agreed to by the House, as follows: Resolved, That as it appear, from the communications of the Executive, that the right of the United States to the free navigation of the Mississippi, is now the subject of negotiation with the Court of Spain; and as it is the interest of the United States, and every part thereof, to come to an amicable adjustment of the right in that mode, rather than resort to any means constitutionally belonging to the Legislature, no farther proceeding should be had on the said remonstrance, during the present session of Congress. Extract from the Journal.  ID378 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1794 	11 	17 	inform 	American papers are received, dated October, 4. 1794. They contain two letters from General Wayne to the American Secretary at War, giving an account of a severe action he had with the Indi ans, who were assisted by the volunteers and militia of Detroit on the 20th August, on the banks of the Miamis, in the vicinity of the British post and garrison at the foot of the Rapids.–The action was bloody, and he says, our army was left in full and quiet possession of the field of battle, which terminated under the influence of the guns of the British garrison, as you will observe by the inclosed correspondence which passed between Major Camp bell Commandant and myself upon the occasion. He adds℃We remained three days and nights on the banks of the Miamis, in front of the field of battle; during which time all the houses and corn fields were consumed and destroyed for a con siderable distance both above and below Fork Mia mis, as well as within pistol shot of that garrison, who were compelled to remain tacit spectators to this general devastation and conflagration, among which were the stores and houses of Colonel Mac kee, the British Indian agent and principal stimu lator of the war now exiting between the United States and the Savages. The American paper from which this account is taken, does not give the correspondence above alluded to, but concludes the article thus: Besides the very important papers which we have been able to offer to our readers this day, the Executive, we understand, has received copies of a correspondence between the British Major Camp bell, and General Wayne. The Major begins it by inquiring of the General by what authority he came there. The General answers by requiring to know who gave Campbell authority to establish a fort at that place, it being within our side of the treaty boundary, and no such establishment there when that instrument was signed. We hope ere long our gallant General will give a good account of this Mr. Campbell.  ID383 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1789 	09 	28 	inform 	Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Antiqua A matter has lately happened here, which may perhaps be attended with serious consequences. There is a little island called Flat Island, near the Island of St. Martin's, which Sir Gillies Payne claims; he lately sent a few negroes there, who with a white man, were driven off by the French. A complaint has been made to Lieutenant-Governor Nugent, who means to know from the Baron de Clugny, whether he avows the fact; if he does, probably it may bring an open rupture, as out troops and ships may be sent down to protect it.
