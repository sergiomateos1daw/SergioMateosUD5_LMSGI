Many of the hailstones were as large as hens eggs–the common size was a little more than an inch in diameter. Twenty-give hours after it fell, banks of it were measured at the foot of a hill, and found to be 20 inches deep. The Saturday following great damage was ??? by hail at Shrewsbury, country of Worcesster. August 15. On Sunday the 25th July, a violent hail storm commenced a few miles to the westward of Wilmington, Delaware, which did great damage to many fields of grain, and blew down, in many places, an immense quantity of timber. The hail in this storm was of an extraordinary appearance; part of it being about two inches long, and of a very considerable circumference. On Saturday, the 1st inst. arrived at Wilmington, Delaware, the brig Maria, Capt. fort, from Londonderry, with 200 passengers. On the 4th inst. arrived at Philadelphia, the Happy Return, Capt. Ewing, in 8 weeks from Londonderry, brought 340 passengers in good health: Capt. Ewing parted, near the Capes of Delaware, with the ship Sally, Capt. Miller, with passengers from Londonderry for that port also. Pennsylvania, July 21. Last Sunday evening Mr. John Garrison, son of William Garrison, of Newbury township, in this county, was killed by lightning in his own house. The lightning struck in at the gable and just at the instant that Mr. Garrison was in the centre of the floor, walking towards the window; his brother was standing within two yards of him when he fell, but providentially received not the smallest hurt. We also learn, that Patrick M'Sherry, of Little's-town, in this county, had two cows killed by lightning, the same evening. New London, July 30. A slight shock of an earthquake was fel tin this and the neighhbouring towns, on Sunday morning last, about thirty minutes past five o'clock. Middletown, July 25. About five o'clock this morning, a noise was heard that seemed to pass over this city, which is thought to have come from a north-westerly direction and proceeded to a south-easterly one. The noise was equal to loud heavy thunder, and the commotion occasioned by it very sensible in the shaking of houses, but no damage was done.– The Tuesday preceding, about six or seven miles to the southward of this place, a similar but heavier noise was heard, attended with the like commotion. Extract of a letter from Dartmouth, (Connecticut) July 26. Some days ago a house near the college, was struck by lightning, and a child therein killed. Since that a woman was killed by the same means in Cornish, a town adjoining Dartmouth, as she sat in her house at work. Later still at Hampton, in New York state, a yoke of oxen were killed, both by one flash of lightning.–From what reason we cannot tell, but the lightning has been peculiarly destructive in many of our settle ments during the present summer. It would aphowever, that nature is willing to repair those losses; accounts having just come to hand, that on last Monday morning a woman in FPlainfield was safely delivered of four girls at a???; one of whom died the night following, the rest likely to do well. Saturday, at a tavern near the market, the following specimen of gormandising was??? ed :–A person, not for any bet, or without any other inducement, than the craving of the stomach,eat, at one meal, a shoulder of roast lamb, 3 slices of bacon, three quarters of a pound of cheese, 15 large cucumbers, one half of an 8d wheat loaf, a plate of cold potatoes, and drank a quarter of cider.  ID344 	Glasgow Advertiser 	Glasgow 	Scotland 	United Kingdom 	1790 	05 	17 	inform 	Kingston, Feb. 6. By a St. Christopher's paper of the 25th ult. we learn, that the small-pox raged lately at >Surinam, to such a degree that, within the space of two months, upwards of 2500 persons had perished by that disorder. A very severe shock of an earthquake was felt between give and six on the evening of last Thursday se'ennight, at the settlements near the Blue Mountains. On Wednesday the 3d instant, arrived at Lucca, the ship Pitt, Captain Hunter, from Africa with154 Gold-Coast Negroes. On the passage from Africa, nine of the seamen mutined, whom Captain Hunter has brought confined in irons, and they are to be tried at a Court of Admiralty Sessions. Feb. 20. Very strong suspicions are entertained by the Americans, that the Indian Chief M' Gilveray, and the nations under his immediate controul, or in alliance with him, are subsidied by the King of Spain. It is a well known fact, that they are regularly supplied with cloathing, arms and ammunition, from the Royal Magazines at St. Augustine and Pensacola, and therefore in all probability; the sword not the olive branch, will be the most speedy and effectual agent for terminating the disputes. March 6. Tuesday last arrived in the harbour of Port Royal, from Cork, his Majesty's ship Chichester, of 44 guns, armed en flute, Lieutenant Craven, Commander, having on board the first battalion of the first or Royal Regiment of of foot, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Dundas. The other Officers are–Captains, Duncan, Franer, Pemberton, and Mannoch; Lieutenants, Sir W. Jas. Cockburne, Bart. Nicholson, Puxley, Clunes, Browne, Clarke, Drummond, and Graham; Adjutant, Sir. W. J. Cockburne, Bart. Quartermaster, Mr. Davidson, Surgeon, MR. Young; Ma?e, Mr. Bolton. The troops in the Chicester amount to 500 men, exch??e of 100 women and children. Colonel Hunter is appointed superintendent of the settlement at the Bay of Honduras, in the room of Colonel Despard, recalled. Col. Hunter came out with the earl of Effingham; it is therefore probable that the disputes which have so long subsisted between Lieutenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of the Bay of Honoduras, will be brought to a speedy determination. At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's estate,a negro blacksmith was sold for the extraordinary sum of two hundred and sixty pounds! At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d regiment quitted the barracks in this town and at Up Park Camp, and embarked on board the Chichester for Great Britain; the 14th at the same time taking possession of their quarters. Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispaniola, that, on the 1st of this month, a number of free people of colour, to the amount of 700 and upwards, having possessed themselves of several field pieces, formed a camp in that districh, and exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarming. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent from the Assembly to demand the reason of so extraordinary a proceeding, the insurgents demanded, that a remonstrance which they then delivered to the deputies, should be presented imimmediately to the general, and that an answer thereto should be given without delay. The paper being conveyed as they desired, proved to be a sensible and well written detail of the various claims the free people of colour had on what they termed the justice of the whites, with whom they demanded an equal participation of all rights and immunities whatsoever–the privilege of representation, and of qualifying for all the learned professions–and concluding with the avowal of a determination to proceed to extremities should their demands be treat with neglect. On the perusal of this paper, it was judged adviseable to assemble a body of the militia, who headed by the General, immediately went against the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired and fled to the mountains; three or four of the whites were killed, and one of the ringleaders was taken and instantly beheaded. A proclamation was then issued, offering a reward of 50 half joes for the head of any principal offender, and in the course of a few days not less than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday the 7th instant, a very great majority of those who had formed the camp, finding all their attempts completely frustrated, came in and took the oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two of the principals, for whom high rewards are offered, are not yet taken. From Port Maria we have received the disagreeable account of the loss of the ship Lion, Capt. Smith, belonging to Liverpool: a violent breeze on the 5th instant drove her from her anchors, and she now lies stranded on the beach.
