        ID111Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18140319informThe following letter received in town, gives a description of the wanton and barbarous conduct of the American army, in destroying a settlement of the Moravian missionaries, in their late irruption into province:– Yesterday I received a very afflicting account from North America, by a letter from New York, dated Dec. 27 1813, concerning a report of the total destruction of our settlement, ??? ??? on the 6th of October, by the American army under General Harrison. It was the consequence of the invasion of that province, after the capture of the little fleet on Lake Erie, and the defeat of the s[?]al British force under the [?] of occupying the Chapel and some other houses for our sick British soldiers, and considering the danger the Christian Indians were in from the malice of the Americans, it was his advice, that the Missionaries and the Indian Congregation should retreat farther into the country. When the Americans were successful in the latter, it became necessary to take steps of effect it. The British behaved very kindly to the brethren, and offered to purchase the houses and cottages, but their defeat prevented it. On entering the place, the Americans first pretended to be friendly, and sorry that the Indians had fled, who had gone with Mr and Mrs Denke (one of the Missionaries) up the river. Mr and Mrs Schnall, and the aged Missionary, Michael Young, remained. During the first night the Americans already changed their tone, or rather showed their real character. They began to abuse the Missionaries with curses, and all manner of insults, plundering the houses ; and General Harrison, to whom we appealed, would grant no redress. They took every thing that was??? away ; and, under a pretence that King's stores and English goods were lodged in the houses, ransacked every place, and every trunk and chest belonging to individuals. Commodore Perry, who had defeated the Mosquito fleet on the lake, was there, and behaved rather better than the rest, advicing the Missionaries to get away as fast as they could. They did so with difficulty, and shortly after the Americans set the place on fire, and burnt down the whole, even every outhouse[?]. The poor Missionaries had a very tedious journey, and reached Silitiz, a settlement of the Brethren in Pennsylvania, December 11. Whither the Christian Indians have fled is not known ; they had proposed to go to the Grand River, about 100 miles off. war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;Native Americans
        ID112Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18140526informA proclamation, issued by Governor Macquarrie, appears in the Sidney Gazette of 14th May, stating that Peter Mills Acting Deputy Surveyor of Lands at Port Dalrymple, Van Dieman's Land, and George Williams, Acting Deputy Commissary of Stores and provisions at the said settlement, had absconded from their habitations, and fled to the woods ; that their object was to live by rapine and violence ; to effect which they had armed themselves, and taken the command of a gang of 26 desperadoes, with whose aid they had committed numerous robberies–entering the lands of settlers, driving away their cattle, and plundering their houses. The proclamation declares that those who shall return to their houses and occupations before 1st December next, shall be pardoned and saved harmless from all offences, except the crime of wilful murder ; and denounces those who shall disregard this offer, as outlaws. Sydney, New South Wales, Jan. 4. The Argo has arrived with a most extensive supply of tea, viz, 167 chests of souchong, 200 ditto bobea, 200 hyson skin, and young hyson 50 ; in all 617 chests. The consequences has been a reduction in the price of souching from 30s to 5s per lb currency. Shortly prior to the Argo's departure from the Island of Mauritius, the Hope American ship, laden with tea and sundies, valued at L80,000, was captured by his Majesty's sloop Harpy, Captain Allen. In consequences of the oppressive conduct of several masters of colonial and British ships, and of their crews towards the natives of New Zealand, of Otaheite, and of the other islands in the South Pacific Ocean, which have led to the destruction of several vessels, with their crews, by the natives, and disturbed all trade and intercourse with those islands, both by British shipping and that ofthe allied powers–his Excellency has forbidden any vessel to clear out from any place in New South Wales, without a bond given by the master or owner to the naval officer for the time being at the port, for L.1000 sterling, binding him and his crew not to commit any act of hostility, or to be guilty of any trespass, or forment any animosities between the natives, or take any part in any war that may prevail ; nor forcibly carry away any male or female inhabitants of the islands under penalty of forfeiting the sum specified in the bond. A small party, who a short time ago undertook[?] a land passage in a direction towards Broken Bay, for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and fertility of the country, have discovered an excellent grazing track of 8000acres. In consequence of which one gentlemen, Mr Robert Campbell, has already sent thither an extensive herd of cattle, and this example is likely to be followed by others. Thomas West, who came to this colony a convict for life, in the ship Earl Cornwall's[?], in 1801, has received from his Excellency a conditional pardon, in consideration of his general good conduct and character for sobriety and industry, and also in consideration of his having lately erected a water mill for the grinding of grain at Barcorn Glen, within two miles of Sydney, being the first water mill ever erected in the vicinty of this town. Sydney, New South Wales, May 21. The good understanding between the natives and our settlers, which had been maintained for the last six years, has given place to frequent outrages attended with fatal consequences. On Saturday, a body of 60 natives commenced plundering the fields of a settler, when three privates of the veteran battalion fired upon them and killed a boy. The narushed upon them before they could load again, and killed on private, Isaac Eustace, and compelled the other two to fly. They then plundered the ground of Messrs Milehouse and Butcher. Next day a party of 14 soldiers falling in with them, shot a woman and two children–the savages attacked William Baker, a stock-keeper of Mr MacArthur, killed the man and two women, named Sullivan and Herburg. Sydney, New South Wales, Feb. 12. On Monday last arrived the ship General Hewett, Captain Earle, from England, having a detachment of the 46th regiment, commanded by Major Oglivie ; and yesterday arrived the Windham, Captain Bligh, also from England, having on board the head-quarters of the 46th regiment, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Molle, who succeeded Lieutenant-Colonel O'Connell, as Lieutenant-Governor of the territory, and is accompanied by Mrs Molle and family ; also Lieutenant Walters, of the navy, agent for transports– Of the 300 convicts which the General Hewett received on board, 35 died on the passage. settlement description;crime;colonial government;international trade;Maori;Pacific Islanders;transportation
        ID113Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18140912inform[Extracts of Letters from Quebec and Montreal.] Quebec, July 15. The commercial world is flourishing here, but in political matters, I am sorry to say, we are sadly in the back ground. The old defensive system is still adhered to, and, I fear much, with all our reinforcements, we shall do little good till we have another commander in chief. There is now a great body of regular troops in this country, and a handful of brave fellows have recently been almost sacrificed par la petite guerre at Chippawa, whilst, in the lower province, there are at least 10,000 regulars doing nothing. Some of the officers of the regiments lately arrived from France do not conceal their sentiments– On inspecting one of the regiments the other day, our chief took occasion, as usual, to make some remarks on the cut of the men's clothes, when the Colonel commanding stepped forward and told him plainly, that such systems were now completely exploded–that he had had the honour of serving very lately under a much more celebrated General that it was probable he would ever serve under again–that his men had been accustomed to fight, not to dance ; and if such was the plan he was called on to follow, he should certainly retire from the service. Such language you may suppose was not very pleasing to our Governor ; but I am happy to find that we now have military men amongst us, who are not afraid to speak out ; as it appears the numberless representations of civilians are not much attended to. Montreal, July 14. I consider this country now as perfectly secure against any attempts that the Americans may make, not withstanding the system of our chief does not seem to be changed. He has received a great many more troops this year than he had any idea of, and does not seem pleased at having so large a force unhis command, as the country will now look to him for some offensive operation against the enemy. He has done nothing the whole summer but parade about 6000 men at Chambly, where he makes them march past him twice a-week, bowing and scraping, instead of employing them where they ought to be. You will have heard of an American army of about 6000, under General Jacob Brown, having crossed the river at Fort Erie, when General Rial, with a force of 1500 only, gallantly assailed them but was overpowered by numbers, and sustained considerable loss. I inclose a general order published yesterday about this unfortunate business, whereby you will find that our loss has been great. Upon this frontier the Americans have hardly any force, and it appears very singular indeed, that so great a body of men, as are now on the other side of the river, from Sorel to Isle Aux Noix, at least 10,000 men, should be left for the purpose of parade, when they are so much wanted in the upper province. I sincerely hope that some investigation will take place into this business, as it is really disgraceful to think that such an enemy should be able to make an attack upon us with impunity. international trade;military;war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States
        ID114Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18141015informQuebec, Sept. 10. The Americans, to the number of 900 men, landed and at tacked Fort Michillimackinac, in Lake Huron, on the 4th August. They were repulsed by the British garrison. The American fort la Prairie du Chiens has been taken by the British. This place was considered as of great importance to the enemy. Major General Conran, of the Royal, has had the misfortune to break his leg, by a fall from his horse. This officer had just arrived to join the army on the Niagara frontier, when he met with this accident. On the 31st August, the British troops broke their encampment at Odell Town, near Lake Champlain, and proceeded immediately to take possession of the position which the American army had just abandoned at the village of Champlain. This army was commanded by General Izard, and are said to have proceeded partly to Plattsburgh, and partly to Sackett's Harbour, on Lake Ontario. The British troops now at Champlain are commanded by Major Gene rals Brisbane, Power, and Robinson, and consist of the 13th, 49, 88th, Meuron's regiment, Canadian chasseurs, &c. &c. The 79th[?] or [?] Glasgow Lowland regiment are now quartered at Cornwall, in Upper Canada. The 4th[?] battalion of the 1st, or Royal Scots, are stationed at Quebec. The 3rd[?], 104th flank[?] companies, 103d, 8th, or King's, 100th, regiment de Watteville, [?] battalion of 1st, or Royal Scots, and 41st flank[?] companies are with the army under Lieutenant General Drummon, on the Niagara frontier, Upper Canada. The 37th and 57th regiments are at Montreal. On the 15th of August, the British troops under Lieutenant General Drummond assaulted Fort Erie. The attack was made in three columns, under Colonel Scott of the 103d regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Drummond 104th regiment, and Lieutenant Colonel Fischer of de Watteville's. The two former were directed to scale the fort, and the latter to get possession of a small hill, named Snake-Hill, which the Americans had fortified, and being situated only about eight hundred yards from Fort Erie, was of consequence to us. This latter column failed in their object ; but the two columns destined for the fort carried the same in a most gallant manner, and obliged the enemy to retire into two stone block-houses inside the fort, when their own guns were turned against them. At this time a most unfortunate explosion took place, which blew up the magazine and battery, and with them a number of our brave soldiers ; and the consternation caused by this was so great, and we were obliged to abandon our conquest, and retreat to our original position, with great loss of both officers and men. The large ship-building by the British at Kingston, on Lake Ontario is to be launched the second week in September– also will carry about 100 guns. The battalion of royal marines, commanded by LieutenantColonel Williams, and which has been stationed lately at Isle au Noix, and parts adjacent, have been broken up and distributed among the fleets on the Lakes. The Staff of the battalion proceed immediately to Halifax from Quebec, in the Ceylong armed-en [?] ship. The Junon frigate, Captain Upton, has arrived from Halifax at Quebec, with money for Government. The crew of this vessel is to be employed on the Lakes. A brig, which sailed from Cork, under convoy of the Antelope, of 50 guns, has arrived at Quebec.–The Antelope, and the ships under convoy, are hourly expected. It is said that there are on board the ships of the latter about 4000 troops, chiefly detachments and reinforcements for the regimentsin Canada. Captain Dowale, of the royal navy, now commands the fleet on Lake Champlain. war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;military;navy
        ID115Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18141015informCanada Papers Quebec, Sept. 3. The army from this province has entered the United States by the Champlain frontier. On the 1st inst. the advance was at Chazy. Quebec, Sept. 8. From the north-western frontier of Upper Canada, Messrs M'Gillivray and M'Leod, who arrived here on Thursday last, have brought dispatches from Lieutenant Colonel M'Donal, at Michillimackinac, written since the repulse of the American forces sent there to recapture it. The following are the particulars of that expedition :– On the forenoon of the 5th of August, the Americans landed 900 men, or thereabouts, at the back of the island (Dowsman's farm). There is a considerable space of ground cleared, and a gentle slope, which enabled their vessels, at anchor close to the beach, to keep clear, by a constant fire of grape, &c. and which by the situation of the ground, passed directly over the men's heads, as they formed and advanced towards the woods. Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual[?] formed his small garrison (150 at most) at the extremity of the woods, and the Indians were stationed on each flank, to keep the enemy from outflanking the troops. By a false account of the enemy's intention to land on another part of the island, a certain number of Indians were sent to watch their motions ; but more Indians absenting themselves, exposed one flank of Lieutenant-Colonnel M'Doual's party entirely ; and an apprehension was entertained that the enemy would outflank and cut off the garrison from the forts ; it was therefore deemed expedient to fall back between the two forts, and there await the advance of the enemy. A party of between 40 and 50 Indians, placed on the left flank, and ignorant of the movements in the centre and right flank, fired on the Americans, and threw them into confusion, which the Indians soon perceived, and encouraging each other by whoops and yells, totally broke the little order still observed by the enemy, who took instant flight, and were all out of reach before Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual was apprised of their retreat. Thus was a body of at least from six to nine hundred men defeated and put to instant flight by 40 or 50 Indians, with a loss of 17 men and a Major (Holmes) killed and found on the spot!–The Indians lost but one man. Previous to and combined with this, the measures taken by the enemy were these: On the [?] of July, a detachment of the expedition sent against Michillimackinac by the enemy, proceeded to St Mary's, where they met with no resistance, there being neither troops nor Indians, and every person occupied about their usual concerns ; such as bay making, fishing &c. Major Holmes commanded the party, who gave up to indiscriminate plunder, and destroyed the whole of the property belonging to the North West Company ; burning their houses, stores, and vessels, killing their cattle, and taking off their engagees prisoners ; tearing down the fences, destroying the gardens, fields, &c. Many wanton acts of cruelty might be detailed. Let two suffice for the present. Mr Johnstone's property was plundered, even his furniture ; the very clothing of his wife and children was seized upon by these ruthless plunderers, and carried away. Major Holmes sent to the south side of the strait for Mr Johnstone's son George, and, after threatening and reviling him with the most oppobrious language, flourished his sword over his head, and said he had a great mind to cut his head off, now he was his slave, When they were in the act of burning the houses and stores, Mr G. Johnstone was ordered to stand in a certain spot, under pain of being shot ; but had he remained, sufforation[?] must have been his fate, being so near the buildings in flames : he therefore risked being shot, and came off, and thereby effected a timely escape. Another instance of more than savage cruelty was exercised on a poor horse, which they made us of all day in carting their plunder, and in the evening, whilst still tackled to the cart, tied him to the end of the dwelling-house then in flames, and amused themselves in looking at the poor animal making vain efforts to get loose ; but there he was burnt, and his bones seen there by the writer of this. war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;Native Americans
        ID116Caledonian MercuryEdinburghScotlandUnited Kingdom18141208informCanada Papers Montreal, Oct. 29 The express from Upper Canada, which arrived yesterday morning, confirmed the highly satisfactory reports of the preceding day, that the enemy had precipitately retreated on the 19th instant, from before Chippawa, after destroying a quantity of provisions and heavy baggage ; and that, on the 21st, they had passed over to Buffaloe a great part of their force, and were blowing up the works at Fort Erie. Further accounts from Kingston have been received this morning to the 26th instant, when the official report of the enemy's retreat from Fort Erie, after the destruction of the works, had not reached that place, but there was no doubt of the fact. Major-Genera de Watteville commanded the corps pressing on the enemy ; the master of a mail which arrived at Kingston on the 25th, in twenty-four hours from Fort George, further confirms the previous intelligence, and reports that several hundred prisoners were taken, before the Americans effected their escape across the river. On the 18th the British came up with his rear guard, and in a sharp action thirty of the Americans were left on the field wihtout a casualty happening on our side. This was at Chippawa Creek.– The enemy then fled with the utmost precipitation to Fort Erie, and began the destruction of his fortifications. A military courier from Kingston arrived this morning, brings no additional news of importance.– Sir James Yeo had returned to Kingston with the sick of the army of Niagara on board. We again sailed for the head of the Lake. A private letter from Niagara of the 10th instant, says that a severe action took place the day before near Chippawa ; our loss is stated at 10 killed and wounded. That of the enemy is supposed to be very considerable ; a field piece made to bear upon one of his columns did great execution. Another letter denies any loss in killed but makes the wounded 25 or 30. Montreal, Nov. 5. From Upper Canada we have received nothing of importance. The report of the whole American armies have crossed the Niagara was a mistake as the last accounts from that quarter mention that General Brown was still in possession of Fort Erie. Quebec, Nov. 3. We are in expectation of some further details of the operations on the Niagara frontier by this day's Montreal post ; but they had no arrived at one o'clock. The evacuation by the enemy of our territory on that frontier is a striking illustration of the importance of the command of the lake. The enemy did cross over to our side till the moment his fleet was ready to assume the superiority. The re-appearance of our fleet effected what could not be done by the expence of so much blood and treasure. (From the Quebec Gazette) The American Government has published the pa pers relating to the late negotations at Ghent. We confess that we have seen these papers with feelings of some satisfaction and much regret ; satisfaction that we can now say that the honour of the British Government is pledged to do something for British interests in North American, and regret that that something is so little. The Indians are to be made independent of both nations. This is perfectly just, and would, under certain cirumstances greatly add to the security of these provinces. The Lakes are to be exclusively British. On these subjects we must be permitted to ask how long they would be permitted to remain so, how long the Indians would retain their independence in the event of another war, if the communication with them should be in the power of the enemy ? The sole communication for military purposes, with the Indians and the Lakes, is by the river St Lawrence, from Montreal to Kingston, and from Niagara to Fort Erie ; and the Americans are to be permitted to remain in possession of one of its banks ! The enemy has hitherto been prevented from interrupting this communication by the thinness of the settlements of their side, the consequent badness of the roads, and difficulty of supplying a large force. The possession of th southern bank of the St Lawrence between Montreal and Kingson, and the power of supplying themselves, and operating on that frontier, by the roads now existing, and from Lake Champlain, has been worth a large force to them, during the whole of the war ; it has caused us to parcel our force to support the line of communication between Lake St Francis and Kingston, and keep a great proportion of it to protect the base of that line in the vicinity of Montreal. The position of Canada, relative to the United States, with its present boundaries, is an extraordinary one ; so much so, that intelligent military men have pronounced it incapable of defence much beyond Quebec. The miserable state of the enemy's preparations, the superiority which we then had on the Lakes, the good disposition of the inhabitants, and the prudent conduct of the commander of the forces, alone saved it. The waste of means in protecting and conveying supplies by a communication of five hundred miles, adjoining the whole way to the enemy's frontie, is conceivable only to those whom experience has made acquainted with the fact, or who are habituated to reflection ; and whenever the communication of the Lakes becomes interrupted, the supply of any force further advanced on the line becomes utterly impracticable. The enemy derives his supplies either by the Lakes, upon which an army can effect nothing, or from a settled country, a long way in his rear, protected by his army, a country covered with woods, and a militia more effective than the best troops in such a country, always ready for the protection of their property and their houses– Under such circumstances, the weakness of an army beyond a certain point is to be counted by its numbers. We scruple not to say, that, whenever that part of the State of New York extending to the St Lawrence, between Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain, shall be fully settled, the whole of Upper Canada must fall to the United States, the Lower Canada will not be defensible but at an expence of means far beyond its value. We had much rather see the Americans confirmed in the possession of Sackett's Harbour, Presqu-ile, Detroit and Michilimackinac, than in the possession of the tract of country just mentioned. Great Britain will always have the means of establishing a superiority on the Lakes, whenever she chuses to exert them, but she never will be able to drive the Americans out of that frontier, when once fully settled, supported as they will be by the immense population of the back parts of the State of New York and adjoining States. From the United States Papers Urbanna, Sept. 25. An express has arrived from Detroit, to General M'Arthur, in six days, in which Governor Cass says– A state of things has arrived, in which your presence, with the force at your disposal, is essential to the security and preservation of the country. The Indians have recommenced hostilities on every side of us ; they are murdering the people, and breaking up the settlements. There is now a large force of them in the immediate vicinity of this place, most probably within a mile of it, with the avowed purpose of attacking the town. We have no force adequate to the defence of the country, and none of description proper for the pursuit of the Indians– My opinion is, that you should hasten on with the mounted men with all possible expedition. The express came by water, the land communiation being entirely cut off. Albany, Oct. 25. The Legislature of this State adjourned yesterday, after a session of four weeks. The principal laws passed are: An act to authorise the raising of troops for the defence of this State. An act to encourage privateering. An act to authorise the raising of a corps of sea fencibles. An act to provide for the repayment of certain sums of money advanced by the Corporation of the city of New York, for the defence of the State, and for other purposes. An act to prevent the apprehension of British deserters. An act to authorise the raising of two regiments of men of colour. An act authorising additional pay to be made to the volunteers, and for paying the militia called into service by the State authority. An act to aid in the apprehension of deserters from the army and navy of the United States. The first act authorises the Governor to call into actual service 12,000 men, for the term of two years, provided the Government of the United States shall have declared their intention to pay, clothe and subsist them at their expence. The privateer bill authorises associations to incorporate themselves for the purpose of fitting out privateers. The following resolution, introduced by Mr Monell, passed both Houses of our Legislature unanimously on Saturday:– Resolved unanimously–That the House of Assembly of the State of New York view, with mingled emotions of surprise and indignation, the extravagant and disgraceful terms proposed by the British Commissioners at Ghent–that, however ardently they may desire the restoration of peace to their country, they can never consent to receive it at the sacrifice of national honour and dignity–that they therefore strongly recommend to the National Legislature the adoption of the vigorous and efficacious measures in the prosecution of the war, as the best means of the bringing the contest to an honourable termination, and of transmitting unimpaired to their posterity their rights, liberty, and independence. The following is a private letter which was brought by the Liffey : Montreal, Nov. 5. 1814. Sir George Prevost reached Kingston on the 10th October, where his presence has been of the utmost importance. Chauncey resigned his blockade of that place on the 8th, and retired with his squadron to Sackett's Harbour. Our fleet which was ready for the Lake in a few days after Sir George's arrival, sailed for Niagara on the 16th, with 500 of the 90th, and a supply of provisions and stores for the right division, and arrived off Fort George on the evening of the 18th. Having landed this reinforce ment, Sir James returned to Kingston on the 24th. The enemy at Fort Erie having been joined by General Izard's army, making a force of 7 or 8000 men, advanced upon General Drummond, and attacked our positions upon the Chippawa on the 15th instant ; but having met with an opposition unexpected by them, and making no impression, retired on the 16th and 17th to Black Creek, from whence they advanced one of Izard's brigades, 1500 men, on the 19th, with a view of our turning our right, and attempted to cross the Chippawa, about six miles from its mouth, where they were met with by a corps of about 1000 troops, under Colonel Meyers, who faced them most manfully ; they skirmished the whole day, in which the Glengarries supported their high character, and, in the evening, Jonathan finding himself foiled, and unable to bring up his artillery from the horrid state of the roads, retired again to the main body at Black Creek. Our casualties on this occasion were triflin– those of the enemy were said to have been considerable, though he refrained from exposing himself to our fire in the open ground. We had two field-pieces there, and whenever the enemy showed a column out of the wood, a well-directed discharge soon obliged them to return to their shelter. By this time our fleet being announced, gave alarm to the enemy, and they commenced a precipitate retreat to Fort Erie. They were purused on the 20th and 21st by our advance, under Major-General Watteville, close to Fort Erie, where he found them occupying the high ground, which General Drummond had not left many weeks before, and could push no further. At the date of the last accounts from General Drummond, Jonathan still maintained his post, from which it will require a few columns of fresh troops to dislodge him, but as they are now on their way to join the right dividion, I trust I shall in a short time have the pleasure to acquaint you of the complete expulsion of the enemy from the Niagara frontier. It is said, that for want of sufficient shelter, a part of General Izard's force had crossed to Buffalo, and that they had passed over some heavy artillery and stores, leaving at the fort such a force as they conceived capable of defending it. Sir James brough down with him the skeleton of the 1st battalion of the King's regiment, and the remains of the two flank companies of the 10th. He sailed again on the 1st inst. taking with him about 1200 men, comprising the 37th, a brigade of artillery, a 9pounder, and detachments from the 6th and 82d regiments, and a large supply of provisions and stores. The five hundred of the 9th regiment who marched to York would be crossed to Niagara in the brigs ; the 9th, 850 strong, were to have been embarked in the fleet, but Sir James could not take them. The Royals, 41st, 89th, and 100th, exhausted corps, return to Kingston by this trip of the fleet, which I fear was scarcely able to make another this season. The St Lawrence has proved a noble ship, and one and all seem delighted with her. The frigate in frame arrived at Kingston, where she has been laid down and lengthened to make her the size of the Prince Regent. The keel of a 74 is also laid down there. The Americans are said to have commenced upon two more ships of the class of the Superior. Letters from Michilimacinack to the 19th October state, that the capture of the two schooners will be attended with the most important benefits in the security of that post, and the territory dependent upon it. Captain Rocheblave, with the detachment of the 81st under Capt. Wardrop, and artillery, arrived there on the 14th October, without any casualty among the troops ; and Mr M'Kenzie, with his brigade, would arrive about the 21st. The two schooners had made a trip to Nottawasage for provisions and supplies, and would attempt another before the navigation closed. A reinforcement had been sent under Capt Bulgar to Praire du Chain. The arrangements necessary for reinforcing and supplying General Drummond's army being completed, and the attack upon Sackett's Harbour being deemed impracticable this season, Sir George returned last evening to this place ; his journey to Kingston has certainly had the effect of inducing General Brown, with a considerable part of his force, to move to Sackett's Harbour, and has thus left General Izard so much weakened at Fort Erie, that I have little doubt of the result of an attack upon him. I am sorry to see that the malice of a certain party here has been at work at your side of the water ; it has increased tenfold since the expression of the public sentiment in favour of his Excellency, by the addresses which are now preparing, and which I can assure you is the real and unsolicited voice of the people. I am happy to find that General Kempt is going to England, as he will afford true information upon the state of the country, and be able to exposethe falsehoods which have been circulated respecting recent events. war;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States;Native Americans;military;privateering
