The multitude are out of employ, and who cannot get into any situations by which they might support themselves, is truly deplorable. If a place falls vacant, a croud of necessitous candidates immediately urge their distresses, and it is certainly a fact, that, for one appointment, there are thirty Englishmen who would be happy to obtain it, so many have gone out lately to India, for whom there is no employment. economic migration;colonial economy
        ID60Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17900104informBoston, October 26. Saturday, between the hours of two and three, arrived in town from New-York, the PRESIDENT of the United States. The inhabitants of this metropolis have now the happiness to felicitate themselves on having among them the virtuous General, who delivered their capital from the oppression of a British foe; and in the same person the magnanimous President of the United States of America.–The President left New-York on Thursday the 15th instant, to visit the Eastern States, attended ouly by his two private secretaries and servants– Actuated by the principles of a true republican Patriot, and considing in the ardent affections of the citizens in the States through which he had to pass, he had it in vic??? travel without the temporary parade which his dignified station might justly clam but wherever he came his merits were already known, and the people, with heartfelt joy, and high approbation of his virtues, saluted him the Defender of their Freedom and Independence. –The worthy Governor of this Commonwealth haivng an exalted estimation of the virtuous President, and although much indisposed as to his health, was determined to shew the President the honours of the government in a stile suitable to his dignity; accordingly he ordered the troops of Middlesex horse to escort him through that county, and permitted General brooks to exhibit to the President on Cambridge Common, as he passed, a fine body of the militia of the 3d division, consisting of about 1000 men, all in complete uniform and equipment. The President was honoured with a salute as he passed them. The Governor requested the Lieutenant Governor and the Council, to meet the President at Cambridge (and would have accompanied them himself hand his health permitted) whither they were escorted by col. Tyler's corps of the horse. The Lieutenant governor and Council met him there, and preceded the President under the escort of horse, and introduced him to the capital of the commonwealth. From the best accounts we are able to collect, we present the following as the Order of Procession. The Independent company of Light Infantry commanded by Major Otis. The Independent Fusiliers, commanded by Cap- tain-lieutenant Laughton. The Independent Cadets, under the command of Major Scollay. Company of Artillery, commanded by Captain Johnson. /[Altogether commaned by Colonel Bradford.] Music. Constables of the town. Deputy-Sheriffs. The Select-Men. Town-Clerk. Committee of Arrangements. The High Sheriff. the Council of the Commonwealth. The Lieutenant-Governor Marshal of Massachusetts District. The PRESIDENT on horseback; with his Suite. Overseers of the Poor. Town-Treasurer. Magistrates. Consul of Holland. The Reverend Clergy. Physicians, &c. Lawyers. Merchants, shopkeepers, and Traders. Then followed the Artizans, Tradesmen, nufacturers, &c. of the town, in order, with flags, &c. On the President's arrival at the State-house, he ascended a temporary balcony, adjoining the gallery, where were a select choir of singers, who, upon the President's appearance, sang the following ODE to Columbia's Favourite SON. 1. Great Washington, The Hero's come, Each heart exulting hearts the sound, Thousands to their Deliverer throng, And shout him welcome all around! Now its full chorus join the songs, And shout aloud great Washington. 2. There view columbia's favourie Son, Her Father, Saviour, Friend, and Guide! There see th' immortal Washington ! His Country Glory, Boast, and Pride Now in full chorus, &c. 3. When the impending storm of War, Think clouds and darkness hid our way, Great Washington, our Polar Star, Arose; and all was light as day. Now in full chorus, &c. 4. 'Twas on your plains they valour rose, And ran like fire from man to man; 'Twas here thou humbled Paria's foes, And chac'd whole legions to the main! Now in full corus, &c. 5. Thro' countless dangers, toils and??? Our Hero led us safely on– With matchless skill directs the wars, 'Till Vict'ry cried–The day's his own! Now in full chorus,&c. 5. His country sav'd, the contest o'er, Sweet peace restor'd his toils to crown, The Warrior to his native shore Returns, and this his fertile ground. Now in full chorus, &c. 7. But soon Columbia call'd him forth Again to save her sinking fame, To take the helm, and by his worth To make her an immortal name! Now in full chorus, &c. 8. Nor yet alone thro' Paria's shores Her fame, her might trumpt blown; E'en Europe, Afric, Asia, hears, And emulate the deed he's done! Now in full chorus, &c. After which, the procession passed by the President, under the gallery, and then dispersed, highly satisfied with the occasion of their assembling, and fully participating in the joy of the day. The Independent Companies then escorted the President to his residence in Court-street–fired three vollies, and then dismissed. In the evening the several public houses in State-street were illuminated, the Coffee House, Bunch of Grapes, Eastern Coffee House, &c. together, which mad a beautiful appearance. Fire works were also displayed in the said street. Rockets were likewise thrown from the French ships in the harbour, and from Castle William. Two French frigates, L'Active and Le Sensible, were delightfully illuminated, the former with several hundred lamps, judiciously arraign ed. It is supposed the number assembled upon the above occasion, amounted to 24,000 persons. No unfavourable accident happened during the whole scene–that we have heard of. The regularity and good order in the procession afforded to the marhals the highest satisfaction, as well as to the numerous spectators. nationalism;songs

        ID62Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17900104informOctober 31. We are informed by very respectable authority, that Mr. M'Gillvry has written to the President of the United States, a full and sensible account of the rise and progress of the disputes subsisting between the Georgians; from which statement he expected to prove, to a demonstration, that he has not acted the inconsistent part which some have alleged, neither has there been such cruelties committed by the Indians. From Mr. M'Gillevry's abilities, and considering he was educated in Europe, being the son of a Scotchman and Indian women, we have no reason to expect any savage cruelties from an of his people; but, on the contrary, it is rather to be presumed that his proposals, which are contained in his letter to the President, are of a rational nature, and many probably bring about a final and an advantageous treaty with the United States. Native Americans
        ID63Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17900104informNovember 12. On Thursday last the Viscount de Ponteves gave a surperb entertainment and ball to a number of respectable ladies of gentleman of this town on board l'Illustre, of seventy-four guns. The boats of the fleet, the state yacht and barge, received the company at Foster's wharf, before 12 o'clock–and on the appearance of the first boat having ladies on board, a signal gun was fired from l'Illustre, and in an instant the squadron was beautifully arrayed with the flags of all nations. On arriving at the ship, the company were very politely received by the Viscount, and conducted to the state room–the marines saluting as the company passed them. At one o'clock the whole sat down to a table liberally spread with a profusion of luxuries and delicacies, in a hall erected for the occasion, which was very fancifully decorated. At the head of the table was a castle of pastry, having thirteen metal guns, by which from tubes that communicated through the table, and the company were saluted with a f–deral dis charge. On the top of the castle waved a small white ensign–the device, two hearts –the motto, The United hearts of America and France. The head of the hall was ornamented with a heart pieced with arrows–and in the motton, Homage to the fair daughters of America, a fine compliment made by the noble Viscount to his female guests. After dinner, the ball began, and closed before nine o'clock, and on departure, his Excellency was saluted with thirteen rockets let off from a boat moored at some distance from the ship. Rhode Island and North Carolina yet remain averse to the new government; they refuse allegiance to all acts of the States, and, of course, do not participate in any privilee; they are treated in respect to port entries, &c. as foreign States. society

        ID67Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17900712entertainCharacter of the Female Sex. By Mr. Ledyard, a celebrated traveller. I have always remarked that women, in all countries, are civil, obliging, tender, and humane; that they are ever inclined to be gay and cheerful, timorous and modest : and that they do not hesitate, like men, to perform a generous action. Not haughty, not arrogant, not supercilious, they are full of courtesy, and fond of society ; more liable in general to err than man, but in general also more virtuous, and performing more good actions than he. To a woman, whether civilized or savage, I never addressed myself in the language of decency and friendship, without receiving a decent and friendly answer. With men it has been otherwise. In wandering over the barren plains of inhos- pitable Denmark, through honest Sweden and fro- zen Lapland, rude, and churlish Finland, unprin- cipled Russia, and the widespread regions of the wandering Tartar ; if hungry, dry, cold, wet, or sick, the women have ever been friendly to me, and uniformly so ; and to add to this virtue (so worthy the appellation of benevolence) these actions have been performed in so free and so kind a manner, that if I was dry I drank the sweetest draught, and if hungry I eat the coarse morsel with a double relish. gender
        ID68Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17900709informWe have this day received Quebec newspapers down to the 24th May, from which the following is extracted:– Quebec, May 20. We hear late accounts from Niagara mention, that the Indians in that quarter are much alarmed in consequence of a message said to be received by them from the States, that they had now raised an army to take their own for Niagara, and that two thousand men of that army were now on their way from New York–desiring the Indians to lye still and look on, and that they would punish those that should interfere. It was also said, that the people of New York were determined of themselves to lay open the post of Oswego, and that emissaries had been employed to persuade the Indians they would be greatly benefited by that event. We are rather inclined to believe the Indians are too sensible of the great benefits already conferred upon them by our neighbours in buying their lands from them, to think of accepting any more from that quarter, and we would recommend it to the new-born Sovereignty on this side the Atlantic, before they testify their impatience, that national treaties, like private agreements, are not to be infringed by one and performed by the other party–Pay and you shall receive. [As to the Americans making an attempt upon Niagara, they have long had it in contemplation to get possession of our posts upon the lakes in Canada.] May 24. The concerned in the ship Columbia and sloop Washington, have received letters from the Captain Kendrick, dated at Nootka in July last; he informs them, that he passed the winter preceding on the north-west coast of America; that he was then bound on a voyage further northward, and from thence intended to proceed to Canton.– The letters were forwarded to Mexico by a Spanish fleet that had been at Nootka, and from thence to the Spanish Charge des Affaires at New York. They were covered to the President of the United States of America. [From what appeared in our paper of Friday last, (see Glasgow Intelligence, p. 424 ) and what is mentioned above, it seems very probable that the affair of Nootka Sound had been a preconcerted scheme between the Americans and Spaniards, as Capt. Kendrick addresses his dispatches for the President of the States without making the least mention (from what is made public) of any British ships being then at Nootka Sound.] Native Americans;United States--Relations--Great Britain;Great Britain--Relations--United States
        ID69Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17900816informBy recent letters from America we learn, that the Congress of the nited States, after warm debates in both Houses, particularly in that of the Representatives, passed an act for the purpose of fixing permanently their seat of Government at German Town in Pennsylvania. The two new provinces in North America, Kentucky and Vermont, whose population already is so very considerable, were formed by the vast numbers of inhabitants who fled from the destruction and ravages of the unhappy contest between Great Britain and her colonies, and though the greatest part of them were then deemed loyalists, yet they have now jooined the American confederation. Seated on the banks of the great river Mississippi, far to the westward of all the other states, they can either navigate northerly to the lakes, or southerly to the Spanish settlements on the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico, and carry on a lucrative trade with the Indians. They are possessed of as fertile a tract of country as any in the world, the position of which they??? also s???d by navigable rivers to Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, and from thence, as their views???tend, to every country in Europe. Thus, from the most distressed situation, to rise to opulence and independence ina few years, must excite admiration. Agriculture, at present, seems to be the peculiar province of American industry, from whence wealth will flow into every part of that vast country, as it abounds in large tracts of rich land, level grounds, with a deep soil, and extended savannahs; while to the northward the fisheries and shipbuilding amply compensate for the want of an equal fertility; and though not so abundant in coin, yet the provinces produce the finest meadows, form whence a provision trade will be every year increasing. The southern countries of Europe, not affording sufficient crops of grain for the support of their inhabitants, on account of the remarkable encrease of population, and which is still augmenting, as arts and manufacturers are every where extended: America may, therefore, be deemed, in future, the granary of this quarter of the globe. international trade;Native Americans;settlement description;colonial politics
        ID70Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17900917entertainA humorous Adventure of a Marriage negotiated by a Bill of Exchange, in one of the English West India Islands. A Merchant, originally from London, having acquired a great fortune in this island, concluded with himself he could not be happy in the enjoyment of it, unless[?] he shared[?] it with a woman of merit ; and knowing none to his fancy he resolved to write to a worthy correspondent of his in London. He know no other [?] than that he used in his trade ; therefore treating affairs of love as he did his business, after giving his friend in a letter several comissions, and reserving this for the last, he went on thus : Item[?], seeing that I have taken a resolution to marry, and that I do not find a suitable match for me here, do not fail to send me by next ship bound hither, a young woman of the qualifications and form following: As for a portion I demand none ; let her be of an honest family ; between 20 and 25 years of age ; of a middle stature, and well proportioned ; her face agreeable, her temper mild, her character blameless, her heatlh good, and her constitution strong enough to bear the change of the climate, that there may be no occasion to look out for a second through lack of the [?] soon after she comes to hand ; which must be provided against as much as possible, considering the great distance and dangers of the sea. If she arrives, and conditioned as abovesaid, with the present letter endorsed by you, or, at least, an attested copy thereof, that there may be no mistake or imposition, I hereby oblige and engage myself satisfy the said letter, by marrying the [?] at 15 days [?]. In witness [?] [?] I [?] [?], [?]. The London correspondent read over and over the odd article, which put the future [?] on the same footing with the bales of good he was to send to his friend ; and after adressing[?] the prudent exactness of the naturalized Creole, and his laconic stile, in enumerating the qualifications he insisted on, he endeavoured to serve him to his mind ; and after many enquiries, he judged he had found a lady fit for his purpose, in a young person of a reputable family, but no fortune ; of good humour, and of a polite education ; well shaped, and more than tolerably handsome. He made the proposal to her as his friend has directed, and the young gentlewoman, who had no subsistence but from a cross old aunt, who gave her a great deal of uneasiness, accepted it. A ship bound for the West Indies was then fitting out at Bristol ; the gentlewoman went on board the same, together with the bales of goods, being well provided with all necessaries, and particularly with a certificate in due form, and indorsed by the correspondent. She was also included in the invoice, the last article of which ran thus : Item, a maid of 21 years of age, of the quality, shape and conditioned as per order ; as appears by the affadavits and certificates she has to produce. Writings, which were thought necessary to so exact a man as the future husband, were an extract from the parish register ; a certificate of her character, signified by the curate ; an attestation of her neighbours, setting forth that she had for the space of three years lived with an old aunt who was intolerably peevish, and that she had not, during all that time, given her said aunt, the least occasion of complaint. And li[?]y, the goodness of her consitution was certified after [?] by [?] [?]. [?] [?] departure the London correspondent sent several letters of advice by other ships to his friend, whereby he informed him that per such a [?] he sent him a young woman of such an age, character, and condition &c. in a word, such [?] desired to marry. The letters of advice, the bales, and the gentlewoman came safe to the port ; and our Creole, who happened to be one[?] of the foremost on the pier and the lady's landing was charmed to see a handsome person, who having heard him called by his name, told him, Sir, I have a bill of exchange upon you, and you know that it is not usually for people to carry a great deal of money about them in such a long voyage as I have made ; I beg the favour you will pleased to pay it. At the same time she gave him his correspondent's letter, on the back of which was wrote, The bearer of this is the spouse you ordered me to send you. Ha, [?][?] ! said the Creole, I never yet suffered my bills to be protested, and I swear this shall not be the first : I shall reckon myself the most fortunate of all men, if you allow me to discharge it. Yes, Sir, replied she, and the more willingly, since I am apprized of your character. We have several persons of honour on board, who knew you very well, and who, during my passage have answered all the questions I asked them concerning you, in so advantageous a manner, that it has raised in me [?] for you. This first interview was in a few days after followed by the nuptials, which were very magnificent. The new married couple are satisfied with their happy union made by [?] of exchange, which was the most fortunate that had happened in that island for many years. marriage;Women--Great Britain;emigration and immigration;international trade
        ID71Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17901004informExtract of a letter from New York, Aug. 3. Our harvest is over westward and through the southern counties of this State. This week will finish it in the northern, and I am confident we have not had so fine a crop since 1774, and all gathered without a drop of rain, which will render wheat fit for exportation in OCtober. The Summer grains are also abundant, and those on the ground, especially Indian corn, equally promising. Should Europe require wheat at even two thirds of the prices given last year, we shall draw a very large balance from them in specie. The public debt of this country having in course of a few days been funded, brought many foreigners into deep speculations, which reduced bills of exchange to par. international trade;agriculture
        ID72Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17901115entertainA Transfer of Conjugal Love. On Monday last was married at Stockport, an inhabitant of Macclesfield, to a female on whom he had fixed his affections. It is to be observed, that he did not toil through the tedious forms of courtship, but at once got a wife, as others sometimes get good places, by purchase –and, as we are informed, the lady was valued at eight guineas and thirty yards of Irish cloth, at 2s. 6d. per yard–which property he deposited in exchange for earthly treasure. –Whether a wife may be cheap or dear at that price, time will shew. Her former husband, having seen military service, was not to be discomposed at trifles, and his philosophy probably being strengthened on the occasion, he attended the happy pair to church, and saw the marriage ceremony ; after which they spent the evening at the bridegroom's house, where all was gaity. The first husband parted with an helpmate had borne his sorrows twelve years ; and the second husband received a partner of his joys, after having buried a former one just a week. marriage
        ID73Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17901119entertainCourt of Chancery. The King, at the relation of the Bishop of London , versus Anderson and Gipps. On the 18th of June, 1692, the Hon. Mr. Boyle left by will the sum of 5400l. to be laid out in lands in Yorkshire, out of the rents of which the sum of 90l. was to be paid annually to the College of William and Mary, in New England, to be applied for the purpose of propagating the Christian religion amongst the Indians in the back settlements in North America ; and likewise a further sum of 45l. to be paid to the same College, for the support of two missionaries to preach the gospel. The city of London were left trustees, and the management under the trust was, by the will, committed to the care of the Bishop of London. The present Bishop instituted this suit, in which the city, and a great number of other persons, were parties, for the single, and indeed novel purpose of knowing, whether (as the teststor had originally devised the several sums for the use of British subjects, and the Americans having ceased to be in that situations since their independence), the annuity ought not to revert to this kingdom, or to some other of his Majesty's colonies, to be applied to similar purposes. This being the first determination of that nature since the American Revolution, the Lord Chancellor decided it with that superior dignity of sentiment that always attends his decrees. Two phrases are sufficient– all charitable devices are to be held sacred– we cannot rake up the ashes of the dead, in search of latent intentions. The annuities and arrears must be paid, and Messrs. Anderson and Gipps, and likewise the city of London, must be paid their costs. bequests;charity;religion;Native Americans

        ID85Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17901213informTHE INDIANS. IT is our wish, in imitation of other newswritters, to give now and then an account of such new publications as deserve the attention of the public; but in a paper, published only twice a week, where so much naturally occurs under the article of temporary news, it is but seldom we can find room for this purpose:–when, however, any ting remarkable appears in the literary world, we never fail to notice it, although it may not be in our power to give an extensive and critical account of its excellencies. We take up the pen with real pleasure at present to announce the publication of a tragedy, intitled THE INDIANS, the reputed offspring of a learned Professor in this University. The great applause with which this play was received, when performed at Richmond Theatre, has raised the expectations of those who were not present at the performance to the highest pitch; and we think we may take upon ourselves to assert, that upon perusing it, even their highest expetations will not be disappointed.– The plot of the piece is taken from a well known story published at the end of a volum of poems, written by the same gentleman. In the choice of a plot, where so many dramatic writers of respectable talents have erred, our author is peculiarly happy. He ha strictly observed the advice of Horace: Denique sit quid vis, simplex dumtaxat et unum. It is simple, and yet it does not disgust by an appearance of nakedness.–It is one, for the complaints of Maraino, and the return of Oniyo, form a beginning; the machinations of Yerdal and Neidan to prevent their meeting a middle; and defeat of those arts, an end, which combined wake up a compleat and connected whole. In the delineation of character the author has, on al every occasion, attended to the quid quemque decent –there are hoever some few parts, which the critic halts to consider, but which amidst so many beauties, he blushes to censure–Some lines, for instance in the character of Ononthio, do not strike us at first as strictly natural. Is so much humanity found inthe breast of an Inan Sachem, as to prompt him to spare a victim, about to be destroyed accoridng to the custom of the country; that victim a captive of war, and not only so, but a Briton, who has been fighting against his countrymen, amongst whom was his only son, whom he bleived slain? Would he exert himself so much in favour of a stranger and a foe, at the risk of displeasing the village, and consequently of losing his power? Or is it likely that he would have greater influence with the superstitious crowd, than he, who was deemed of skill to bend to his purpose the demons that sway the fortune of mankind?–Another question concenring Ononthio, and we leave him. Is it consistent with the philosophic firmness of the Sachem, so to despair on receiving news of his son's death, as to declare that he should know no comfort, but to die? or is it consistent with his humanity to leave Maraino at such a period of distress, when she most stood in need of his kind offices?–The first, and best supported character in the piece is that of Maraino. Her mind seems intended as the seat of every amiable virtue. Her grateful reverence of Ononthio, her unaffected piety, and her humanity, in interfering to save an unknown captive from death, are pleasing??? which give??? an insight into her nature. In the breast of Mariano every thing is subordinate to her love for Onaiyo: this leading feature in her caracter is properly kept in view during the course of the piece. But even in this master-piece the author, has, perhaps, once deviated a little from nature. The sentiments Maraino utters during the conversation with Sydney, in the fifth act, are rather those of a Phiosopher and Divine, than a young creature, the chorus of whole heart are tuned to the sweetest strains of tenderness and love. Can she, who had lately discovered a long lost brother, talk so coldly in his presence; Can she, who had so lately heard of the safety of an adored-husband, so entirely banish his image from her mind, as to converse on matters so indifferent? Can the gentle Maraino become the cold moralist?–With this one exception, the part of which we are speaking is finely drawn and highly interesting.–The language of the piece is every where elegant, and in many places, where the sentiment requires it, sublime. The author has frequently dignified his verse by the introduction of obsolete words; this in general produces a good effect–but there is a danger of using them too often, and of chusing them too ancient. it is a dangerous and difficult talk where all is so excellent, to refer to any particular passage of scene as deserving most notice: it requires no small degree of taste and judgement. If there is any preference to be given, it is perhaps to that scene in the 2d act, where Onaiyo gives an account of the battle at Quebec; and the scene in the 4th act, where Maraino is prompted by Neidan to slay her brother,–who proves his innocence by the production of her husband's belt, the sight of which draws an elegant speech from the enraptured fair. This scene, however, would be improved did it conclude with something more apt to the joyful moment, than the solemn sounds of Ononthio: a speech excellent in itself, and containing a very fine sentiment, Sed nunc non erat his locus.– Upon the whole, the tragedy, upon which we have, guided by impartiality, spoken so freely, is in our opinion far superior to most of those plays which have appeared of late years:–it is devoid of bombast:–it is nature–and she must inevitably please. theatre;Native Americans

The sick man was consequently burnt. A Colonel Harling has greatly exerted and distinguished himself in opposing the Indians on a part of the American frontiers. This gentleman, with two hundred men, even went into the very heart of an Indian settlement, and defeated the savages.

They waited on Colonel Trigge, of the 12th regiment of foot, and some other officers of distinction. One of them, who was born in England, named Bowles, speaks English indifferently well, and is extremely communicative. He went over to America with his parents, who were in the army, when a boy, and by some means strayed to an Indian camp, where he was most hospitably received, and afterwards rais ed to the highest honours of their nation. The Cherokee Chiefs are expected in town this day, to deliver their??? to Mr. Secretary Grenville. Native Americans

These six Chiefs have 20,000 warriors ready to take the field, and have the strongest wish to act in conjunction with the English. They travelled 3000 miles before the reached Halifax, and were near 12 months in performing the journey. From Halifax they went in an English frigate to Quebec to Lord Dorchester, by whom they were sent over to England to concert their plans in person with the Ministry. The object of their coming to this country may be easily guessed at.

Of its success there cannot be a doubt, when we shall be aided by an army of 20,000 Indian warriors, beside the active support of those Mexicans now ??? under the tyranous yoke of Spain. So determined are the Cherokees, the Creeks, and other nations of Indians in the Southern parts of America, to strip the Spaniards of their possessions on that Continent, that they will unquestionably attempt the glorious achievement, even though the policy of this country should prevent us from lending them effectual assistance. The rich silver mines at Potosi, in Peru, were accidentally discovered in 1545, by an Indian, as he was clambering up the mountain, in pursuit of a Lama, which had strayed from his flock. Soon after, the mines, of Sacotecas, in New Spain, little inferior to the other in value, were opened. From that time successive discoveries have been made in both colonies, and silver mines are now so numerous that the working of them, and of some few mines of gold in the provinces of Terra Firm, and the new Kingdom of Grenada, has become the capital occupation of the Spaniards, and is reduced into the system no less complicated than interesting. war;Spanish Empire

Many of the hailstones were as large as hens eggs–the common size was a little more than an inch in diameter. Twenty-give hours after it fell, banks of it were measured at the foot of a hill, and found to be 20 inches deep. The Saturday following great damage was ??? by hail at Shrewsbury, country of Worcesster. August 15. On Sunday the 25th July, a violent hail storm commenced a few miles to the westward of Wilmington, Delaware, which did great damage to many fields of grain, and blew down, in many places, an immense quantity of timber. The hail in this storm was of an extraordinary appearance; part of it being about two inches long, and of a very considerable circumference. On Saturday, the 1st inst. arrived at Wilmington, Delaware, the brig Maria, Capt. fort, from Londonderry, with 200 passengers. On the 4th inst. arrived at Philadelphia, the Happy Return, Capt.

About five o'clock this morning, a noise was heard that seemed to pass over this city, which is thought to have come from a north-westerly direction and proceeded to a south-easterly one. The noise was equal to loud heavy thunder, and the commotion occasioned by it very sensible in the shaking of houses, but no damage was done.– The Tuesday preceding, about six or seven miles to the southward of this place, a similar but heavier noise was heard, attended with the like commotion. Extract of a letter from Dartmouth, (Connecticut) July 26. Some days ago a house near the college, was struck by lightning, and a child therein killed. Since that a woman was killed by the same means in Cornish, a town adjoining Dartmouth, as she sat in her house at work.

        ID341Glasgow AdvertiserGlasgowScotlandUnited Kingdom17900222informFrom the Jamaica Royal Gazette. Kingston, Nov. 28. By late arrivals from Hispaniola we learn, that the people are in quietness, but still armed; and that the Governor, who had been suffered to remain, but the Intendent only having fled, is perfectly submissive to the will of the people. For several days last week the weather at the north side, and in some of the Liguanea Mountains blew in most alarming gusts, and the cold is said to have been peculiarly sever; some plantain trees have been thrown down, but we have yet heard of no material damage. The sloop Resolution has brought into port a part of his Majesty's 10th regiment of foot, consisting of a serjeant, and 29 privates, having received them from on board the ship Commerce, Foot, from London, off the East End on Thursday last, the Commerce being destined for Savanna la Mar. Dec. 26. Late on Thursday evening his Majesty's ship Amphion, Captain Nichols, returned to Port-Royal from the Spanish American coast. The Amphion was bound to Carthagena, but was prevented by the jealousy of the Spaniards from entering that port. Accounts are said to be received by her that a revolt has taken place amongst the Indians in that quarter, and that the Spaniards are demolishing the fortifications throughout the country, which it has cost them so much labour and expence to raise; so appre hensive are they of the numbers and force of the malcontents, should they possess themselves of any of those strong holds. We learn from Georgia, that the treaty with the Indians, to negotiate with Commissioners were appointed by the President of the United States, has been broken off; and that Mr. M'Gillivray and his warriors have declared, that nothing short of a cession of the territory between the rivers St. Mary and Altamaha will satisfy them; adding, that no equivalent can be given to the Georgians for relinquishing their claim to the district in question, as it is founded in usurpation. The views of Mr. M'Gillivray in making this requisition are evident, as it is known that he wishes to establish a sea-port at St Mary's, as well for thecommercial emolument, as for the civilization of his countrymen, by an intercourse with foreign States. slave insurrections;weather;shipping;shipping;Native Americans;international trade;foreign relations

General Wayne, at the head of two thousand Provincials, had completely routed them after a great slaughter. After the battle, Macgillivray and his savages took refuge in the woods. General Wayne has destroyed the most part of the habitation of these Indians in the extent of 200 English miles along the river, which is the boundary of Georgia, after which he returned to Savannah.

It is well known, that the Indians on the back settlements have been regularly supplied with arms and ammunition from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies, to enable them to distress the Americans, and prove at least a hindrance to their growing prosperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi has been denied them?and the Spaniards, now in possession of the Floridas, have been continually quarrelling with them about their boundaries. It may therefore be considered as almost certain, that the American states will take an active part against Spain. This will be a great acquisition to Britain in every point of view; for though American cannot furnish money, she can furnish men and provisions; and afree intercourse with her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the security of our West-India Islands.

On the passage from Africa, nine of the seamen mutined, whom Captain Hunter has brought confined in irons, and they are to be tried at a Court of Admiralty Sessions. Feb. 20. Very strong suspicions are entertained by the Americans, that the Indian Chief M' Gilveray, and the nations under his immediate controul, or in alliance with him, are subsidied by the King of Spain. It is a well known fact, that they are regularly supplied with cloathing, arms and ammunition, from the Royal Magazines at St. Augustine and Pensacola, and therefore in all probability; the sword not the olive branch, will be the most speedy and effectual agent for terminating the disputes. March 6. Tuesday last arrived in the harbour of Port Royal, from Cork, his Majesty's ship Chichester, of 44 guns, armed en flute, Lieutenant Craven, Commander, having on board the first battalion of the first or Royal Regiment of of foot, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Dundas. The other Officers are–Captains, Duncan, Franer, Pemberton, and Mannoch; Lieutenants, Sir W. Jas. Cockburne, Bart. Nicholson, Puxley, Clunes, Browne, Clarke, Drummond, and Graham; Adjutant, Sir. W. J. Cockburne, Bart. Quartermaster, Mr. Davidson, Surgeon, MR. Young; Ma?e, Mr. Bolton. The troops in the Chicester amount to 500 men, exch??e of 100 women and children. Colonel Hunter is appointed superintendent of the settlement at the Bay of Honduras, in the room of Colonel Despard, recalled. Col. Hunter came out with the earl of Effingham; it is therefore probable that the disputes which have so long subsisted between Lieutenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of the Bay of Honoduras, will be brought to a speedy determination. At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's estate,a negro blacksmith was sold for the extraordinary sum of two hundred and sixty pounds! At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d regiment quitted the barracks in this town and at Up Park Camp, and embarked on board the Chichester for Great Britain; the 14th at the same time taking possession of their quarters. Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispaniola, that, on the 1st of this month, a number of free people of colour, to the amount of 700 and upwards, having possessed themselves of several field pieces, formed a camp in that districh, and exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarming. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent from the Assembly to demand the reason of so extraordinary a proceeding, the insurgents demanded, that a remonstrance which they then delivered to the deputies, should be presented imimmediately to the general, and that an answer thereto should be given without delay. The paper being conveyed as they desired, proved to be a sensible and well written detail of the various claims the free people of colour had on what they termed the justice of the whites, with whom they demanded an equal participation of all rights and immunities whatsoever–the privilege of representation, and of qualifying for all the learned professions–and concluding with the avowal of a determination to proceed to extremities should their demands be treat with neglect. On the perusal of this paper, it was judged adviseable to assemble a body of the militia, who headed by the General, immediately went against the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired and fled to the mountains; three or four of the whites were killed, and one of the ringleaders was taken and instantly beheaded. A proclamation was then issued, offering a reward of 50 half joes for the head of any principal offender, and in the course of a few days not less than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday the 7th instant, a very great majority of those who had formed the camp, finding all their attempts completely frustrated, came in and took the oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two of the principals, for whom high rewards are offered, are not yet taken. From Port Maria we have received the disagreeable account of the loss of the ship Lion, Capt. Smith, belonging to Liverpool: a violent breeze on the 5th instant drove her from her anchors, and she now lies stranded on the beach. disease;earthquake;shipping;slavery;mutiny;Native Americans;shipping;slavery;rebellion;shipwreck

Its fur, though beautiful and magnificent, is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the Southern Provinces. Pekin is, therefore, the proper mart for this valuable commodity, and in this immense city, the consumption is so great, that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale. The Mandarins of the Court, and even the Emperor himself, are fond of wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank, a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury. The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds, that all the blankets, cloths, hats, and stockings, that could be procured in China, if English manufacture, were sold to the Indians, with whose Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed. An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to be recorded. The Spaniards discovering that Callicum, a Chief, second in authority at Nootka Sound, was in alliance with the English, he was shot through the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife of Callicum, with an infant child, escaped, but not till wounded. Macquilla, the Chief, first in command, retired at the head of the allies of England, from Nootka Sound, and to avoid the cruelty of the Spaniards, they fled to distant parts. Such of the natives as they could seize, the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications. At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands, with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. And we further add, on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration, that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain Mears, the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines. Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of Kamschatka, and other ports belonging to the Russians, with the teas and other produce of China. This promised to be an invaluable channel of commerce, as the Chinese have shut their ports against the Russians, who On this voyage of discovery and experiment, one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo, but was unfortunately lost on her return to China. To these curious particulars we add, with a patriot joy, that the consumption of the glorious staple of England, her broad cloths, is astonishingly great in Japan and China: British hard ware, &c. is also in great request. From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears, ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility.
