Emigration. –It will be observed, from an advertisement in to-day's paper, that Government are fitting another ship for the *free*  conveyance of single females from London to Van Dieman's Land ; and from the great demand for agricultural labourers, and mechanics of every description, in that colony, it has been resolved to grant a passage to that class, at a cost not above what is paid to America–Government paying the remainder of the sum as a bounty, amounting to t30, which may certainly be looked upon as a great boon, both by individuals and the colony at large. In all the colonies there appears to be a scarcity of working people, as from an official document in our possession, it is asserted, on authority, that in Upper Canada agricultural labourers, domestic servants, and tradesmen of every description, will be for some years in great request. Farm labourers readily obtain from t25 to t30 per annum, with board, lodging, and washing, and day-labourers from 3s. to 4s. per day, with provisions. The government agent for emigration for the Canadas asserts he could find immediate employment for 20,000 working people, as public improvements are much retarded for want of hands. As this is the best season, we would advise all those intending to emigrate to apply to the government agent for emigration at the Custom House, Leith, who will give gratuitous information regarding the colonies, and advise as to the best method of putting their plans into execution. The rate of wages for every description of mechanics may be likewise seen there.

*The New Australian Colony.* –The Cygnet, with the first party of emigrants to the New Colony of South Australia, will sail to-day from Gravesend ; eight gentlemen have gone out as surveyors, taking with them upwards of twenty artisans and labourers, a surgeon, steward, and harbour-master.

Australian Colonies.–We have seen a printed circular containing extracts of a letter from Mr John Sullivan, surgeon-superintendent of the Emigrant ship *Canton*, dated Sydney, 6th October 1835, addressed to Edward Forster, Esq. chairman of the Emigration Committee, London. In this letter Mr Sullivan mentions that the female emigrants, on landing, were placed in spacious and commodious buildings, adjoining the Government House, at Sydney, where every attention was paid to their comfort and security from improper intrusion. The writer further states :–" We landed in Sydney a greater proportion of well conducted, industrious, and virtuous young women, than were ever before landed from any of the ships of the Emigration Committee that came to these Colonies. Three-fourths of the young women were engaged, and went into comfortable situations, on the first and second days after landing ; and before a week all the useful and good servants, viz. laundresses, cooks, servants of all work, dairymaids, and housekeepers, were in places, many of them in Syndey and the surroundings districts ; several were taken up the country to Maitland and Bathurst ; and as many more cooks, laundresses, dairymaids, or farm servants as we had, could obtain places in that time, for these are the descriptions of female servants in demand throughout the colony. The wages varied from t8 to t20. Some, who were not very good servants of all work and housemaids, got t8 to t10 ; cooks and laundresses, t12 to t16 (the latter are much wanted) ; housemaids and needlewomen, t10 to t12 ; housekeepers, t16 to t20. Governesses also are much sought for it ; if we had had twenty qualified they could have got situations in respectable families and schools ; but the salaries to this class are small, say t25 to t40. Nursery governesses got t20. All the male emigrants who understood agriculture, or the management of stock in general, but particularly sheep, were engaged immediately, at salaries varying from t40 to t50, with a house and rations for family use." We understand that the *Canton*  had a number of females from Edinburgh and its neighbourhood, and the above information must be highly satisafactory to their relatives.

Sir George Clerk. –As the cawing of the rooks portends a storm, it is worth while to mention that the cunning baronet has come down from London, and commenced a canvass in this county within these few days. It is stated, we believe upon good authority, that he accounts for this course of proceeding, by referring to the great probability of the Lords throwing out the Irish Municipal Bill.Burn's Monument. –We understand that there is now an early prospect of the completion of this monument, which has too long remained in an unfinished state, to the surprise of strangers, and the discredit to our Modern Athens. The sum already in the Treasurer's hands, aided by the profits of the handsome musical work lately issued by Mr M'Leod, which he has generously devoted to that purpose, is now nearly sufficient to meet the calculations of the expense requird for the railing in and decoration of the ground around the monument. We expect, therefore, that the work will forthwith be commenced, and if a few pounds are still wanted, we have no doubt there are hundreds in Edinburgh who would willingly guarantee the Treasurer against any loss by the immediate completion of the undertaking.*Annuity Tax.* –We understand that deputations from several places in the country, are expected to attend the public meeting which is to be held on Tuesday evening, for the purpose of petitioning Parliament for the abolition of the Annuity Tax, in order to testify their abhorrence of that system of politico Christianity which requires distraint and imprisonment for its support. We observe that Mr Gillon, of Wallhouse, M.P. is to take the chair. The meeting we doubt not, will be most numerously attended.Law of Scotland. –The prizes given by Professor Bell, for the greatest proficiency in the examinations, were yesterday awarded to Mr William Neish, 25, India Street, in the senior, and to William Spence, 31, Broughton Place, in the junior class. The following gentlemen also distinguished themselves in the competition : Mr John Fraser, James Gilchrist, James Mason, James Scott, in the senior class; James Oliver, David Gale, John R. Banks, James Charles Murray, Wm. M'Naughton, in the junior.*Kilwinning, March*  30.–The United Associate Presbytery of Kilmarnock met at Kilwinning on Tuesday, the 22d March, and ordained Mr A. Macgregor to the pastoral charge of the congregation in that place. The Rev. D. Henderson, of Dalry, preached and presided. The Rev. Mr Cairns, of Stewarton, ordained, and the Rev D. Ronald, of Saltcoats, gave the charge to the minister and congregation. On the Sabbath following, the Rev. Mr Tait, of Barrhead, introduced Mr Macgregor to his congregation ; and there is every prospect that the hitherto long disappointed congregation of Kilwinning will now prosper under the pastoral care of their much esteemed and highly talented young minister.*Presentation of Plate.* –Mr A. S. Walker, late of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, at present manager of the branch of the Commercial Bank of England, at Uttoxeter, in Staffordshire, was lately presented with an elegant tea service by the proprietors of that establishment, bearing the following inscription :– "Presented to Mr Archibald S. Walker, by the Uttoxeter Proprietors of the Commercial Bank of England, as a small acknowledgement of his faithful and valuable services–March, 1836." This is another proof of the estimation in which many of the young men are held who have been trained to the banking system in this country. From a Return, just published, we find that the emigration to Canada has been comparatively small last year. The whole number of emigrants landed at Quebec and Montreal in 1835, was 12,527 : in 1831 and 1832 four times, and in 1834 two times as many were sent out. Of the 12,527, there were 5597 adult males, 3866 females, and 3064 children under 14 years. Of the whole number, 1043 were sent out by parochial aid. The numbers from the three kingdoms were– England, 3067 Ireland, 7,108 Scotland, 2,127 From Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, &c. 225 Settled in Lower Canada, 2,297 Upper Canada, 9,800 Died at Grosse Isle and Quebec, 13 Returned to the United Kingdom, 117 Removed to the United States, 300 –12,527But besides those who went to Canada, 16,749 landed at New York, raising the whole number of emigrants to 29,376. There were no less than three vessels wrecked last year on their way to Quebec– the William Ewing from Londonderry with 300 passengers, all saved–the barque James from Newfoundland, all saved–and the Nathaniel Graham from Cork, with 48 persons on board, passengers and crew, of whom 41 were lost.From another part of the Report, we find that 2764 female emigrants were sent out to Australia last year, under the superintendence of the Emigration Committee. Of these 2105 had a free passage. The arrangements seem to have been ood ; for the mortality was small, and few complaints were made. The females were all of decent character, and due care was taken on their arrival to get them disposed of as servants, in situations where their morals would not be exposed to unnecessary risk.Ulster Railway. –Length 36 miles, from Belfast to Armagh ; capital t600,000, in 12,000 shares, of which t393,000 are subscribed. The number of passengers expected is 450,000; the expected income is t93,000, of which t67,800 is from passengers ; the estimated expense of the work is t539,000. The steepest gradient is 1 in 200. There are 3 tunnels of 310, 320, and 570 yards in length.East Lothian Railway. –We call attention with great pleasure to the Prospectus of a railway from Dunbar to Edinburgh, by Haddington and Tranent, which appears in our first page. No one can have travelled over the ground without observing how admirably it is fitted for this species of communication, by its remarkable uniformity of surface. We should have doubted whether such a work would pay, had it terminated at Edinburgh ; but as a part of an unbroken line reaching across the most fertile and populous parts of Scotland, from the German ocean to the Atlantic, its chances of success are vastly increased.Dundee and Arbroath Railway. –The Committee's report on this railway has reached us, but we must confine ourselves to an abstract. The length is 16 miles 5 furlongs and 90 yards ; the capital t100,000, divided into 4000 shares, which is all subscribed, but authority is taken to raise t40,000 more by loan ; sum paid up t5000 ; subscribed by shareholders locally interested t88,900, by others t7150 : there are three subscribers for t2000 and upwards : the expected income from passengers is t16,912, goods t14,654, from both t31,566. There are no tunnels, no inclined planes, and the steepest gradient being only 1 in 1000, scarcely differs from a dead level. It does not cross any highway or turnpike on a level. The estimated expenses is t99,844.Statute Labour Acts. –It appears from the votes of the House of Commons, that a Select Committee has been appointed to investigate the Scottish Statute Labour Acts, and to consider what amendments may be made thereon. It may be stated, that by the present act for this county, proprietors of land, and several other descriptions of people are totally exempted from any burden, on account of the coaches, chaises, gigs, or saddle horses they may keep, though it is quite plain good roads are of as much advantage to them as to the occupiers of land, upon whom almost the sole burden is thrown. In many parishes a considerable addition would be made to the road funds, were no such exemptions allowed. At present the management is vested in heritors, rated at one hundred pounds Scots and upwards, though it is stated with confidence, that were the occupiers of land included, beneficial consequences would follow.– *East- **Lothian Correspondent.**Leith Mechanics' Friendly Assurance Society.* – The fifth annual meeting of this Institution was held on Tuesday last–John Hutton, Esq., one of the Honorary Members, President of the Society, in the chair. A very satisfactory report for the last year was read, and thanks were voted to the different Officebearers. It appears that this society was established under the countenance of the Magistrates and Ministers, and various influential individuals in Leith, and is well deserving of encouragement, as affording the benefits of mutual insurance to the working classes, the lowest rates consistent with perfect security. The funds, we understand, are in a prosperous state.*Hay and Straw.* –In consequence of it having been alleged last Wednesday, that higher prices were got for straw than those quoted, we have made due inquiry, and find there are no grounds for such an allegation. We have been further assured, that in reporting the prices of hay and straw for these two years past, the clerk of the corn market has never shown a desire to favour the farm servants at the expense of their employers, or to favour either party at the expense of the public.The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have been pleased to grant by their warrant, dated the 6th of April 1836, a distinguishing flag to be worn by the respective vessels belonging to the Eastern Regatta Club of Scotland, viz. a blue cornet flag, with a white St Andrew's cross on the upper quarter on a red field.Heriot's Hospital. –At the meeting of the Governors of George Heriot's Hospital, on Thursday the 7th instant, the estimate of Messrs Trotter for alterations and repairs on the chapel, amounting to t935, was accepted, and it will gratify the friends of economy to learn, that this is t65 under the sum voted by a majority of the Governors for that purpose some time ago. Thereafter a unanimous vote of thanks was passed to Councillor Gillespie Graham, for gratuitously furnishing a plan of the intended improvements on the chapel, which was described by Councillor Grant and others, as highly creditable to the skill and good taste of that distinguished architect. The Governors then proceeded to consider the list of applications for admission of boys, preparatory to the usual half-yearly election. There were 16 vacancies and 37 applicants, who may be thus classed :–Those who have never received benefit from George Heriot's Hospital, or any other institution, 12 Those who have received benefit for one child, 13 Do. for two children, 6 Do. for three children, 5 Do. for five children, 1 37In considering cases the present practise of the Governors is to give preference, first to children of widows (being poor), then to those who have never received benefit, afterwards those who have had only one child in, and so on. These were but three applications for widow's children, and one for an orphan, out of the above number, and it is therefore probable, considering the large population of Edinburgh, that it is not sufficiently known, that George Heriot, in his will, expressly points out the *fatherless*  and *poor*, being children of burgesses and freemen, as the objects of his charity–hence, if there be not a sufficient numbers of really necessitous cases, the Governors, in filling up the vacancies, may elect some that do not appear to have strong claims, simply from those that have such claims not coming forward in sufficient numbers. Political Economy. –On Thursday last the course of lectures on Political Economy, delivered by Dr Thomas Murray, in Elder Street Chapel, was brought to a conclusion ; on which occasion the thanks of the meeting were, on the motion of one of the members of committe, voted by acclamation to the lecturer for his valuable services. After thanks had been returned by Dr Murray, Mr A. G. Hunter, merchant, was called to the Chair, and some conversation having taken place, the committee of management, who had necessarily been self-elected, were confirmed by the meeting in their office, and empowered to take such steps as they might think expedient for obtaining lectures to the industrious classes next winter. We understand that Dr Murray is to be entertained at supper, some evening next week, on the occasion of being presented with a piece of silver plate.It is with much regret we learn that John Grieve, Esq. of Newington Cottage, died on Monday last. He was beloved and esteemed for his estimable qualities by all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance, and his death will be long and deeply regretted.*Rare Sights in London.* –A young Scottish Miss, who had voyaged the length of London on a pleasure jaunt, returned the other day by one of the steamers, and was met on landing by various members of her family, who anxiously inquired what she had seen in London. " Seen !" exclaimed the fair tourist "I have seen such *sights !*  I saw the *Theological *Garden, and all the wild beasts in't!"The Theatre.–Mr C. Kean concluded his engagement on Thursday evening–an engagement the longest and most brilliant of any that our Theatre has witnessed for many years. Mr Kean has been with us for a whole month, and has succeeded in crowding the house almost every night. We understand that upwards of 30,000 persons have visited the theatre during his engagement–a number beyond that of any former period of equal duration. In that time he has appeared in some of the most arduous and difficult of Shakespeare's characters Hamlet, Richard, Macbeth, Othello, Shylock, and King John, investing each with its own peculiar charms and interest, and exciting the highest admiration and astonishment at the versatility and power of his genius, which could give such individuality and truth to so many dissimilar, distinct, and separate classes of characters. The play with which his engagement concluded was Richard, which character he has performed *seven*  times during his engagement ; the house was, as usual, crowded in every part, and he exerted himself most strenuously and successfully. At the conclusion the cheers of the audience were loud and long, and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage from different parts of the house. Mr K. being loudly called for, appeared in front of the stage, and delivered the following very neat and appropriate address:–" *Ladies and Gentlemen,* –I now stand before you for the last time this season, but believe me whichever way my pilgrimage may bend, my thoughts will ever recur to Edinburgh as those of a child to its distant home, fondly anticipating the hour when he shall again stand upon its threshold. (Great cheering.) Till that period permit me with a heavy, but a grateful heart, to pronounce that melancholy word– farewell." (Mr Kean then withdrew amidst reiterated and enthusiastic plaudits from all parts of the house.) –Mr K. we perceive, appears next in Aberdeen, where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his performances. The boxes there, we are told, are already taken for several successive nights to come.– Mrs Honey, from the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, makes her appearance here on Monday first.On Wednesday evening, Mr John G. Moxey, baker, Castle Street, was entertained at supper, in Menzie's Hotel and Tavern, Waterloo Place, by a party of friends, of about fifty in number, previous to his leaving this country for America, to which he is about to emigrate. The company was very harmonious, and the compliment must have been very gratifying to Mr Moxey.*Qualifications of General Assembly Elders.* –The Presbytery of Cupar, at their meeting on the 29th ult. elected the Earl of Leven and Melville, and Walter Malcolm, Esq. Edinburgh, to represent them in the ensuing Assembly. Mr Malcolm is factor for Captain Hay of Mugdrum, who is principal heritor in the parish of Newburgh, and was lately ordained an elder there. Against his election to serve in the Assembly a protest and appeal were taken, on the grounds, as we understand, that he has no domicile within the bounds of Presbytery, and is not an officiating elder; the protesters allowing that his election, though consistent with the letter, is contrary to the spirit of an act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal is sustained, it is evident that a large proportion of the Assembly elders must vacate their seats. Intimation also was given by D. Maitland M'Gill, Esq., that when the commissions came to be attested, he would move for evidence being produced that the elders-elect maintain family worship. An amusing inquiry was instituted in the Presbytery last year respecting the Earl of Leven's habits of domestic devotion ; and a clerical member had the candour to say, he should wish to know how it was with the ministers themselves in that respect.The University of St Andrews has just conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity on the Rev. Professor Paxton, of Edinburgh. In bestowing this public honour on one, who, during a long and useful life, has done so much for the cause of literature and religion, the members of the College have done an act which shows that they can appreciate real merit, and which will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious public of Scotland. Those who have had the good fortune to enjoy the public ministrations of Professor Paxton, and even the general church-going community, are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence, of the pious and heartfelt warmth, and of the classical elegance which have long characterised his public preaching. Even beyond the religious body of which he is the ornament, he is well known as one of the most popular and impressive teachers of the day. In his lectures on Theology, as Professor to the General Associate Synod, and afterwards to the Associate Synod, he displayed the results of an extensive and profound critical study of the Scriptures, and of an unwearied research into the Natural History, and the manners and usages of the ancients nations. The work by which he is chiefly known as an author– *The Illustrations of Scripture* –will long bear testimony to the extent of his learning, and of his Oriental investigations, and to his powers of lucid and eloquent composition. We understand that the attention of the College was directed to Mr Paxton's merits by the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages. This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the same field of study, reflects high honour on the discrimination and the heart of Mr Tennant.*Public Dinner to Professor Dick.* –On Tuesday last, the Students ofthe Edinburgh Veterinary College and a number of Veterinary Surgeons and other gentlemen (in all upwards of 70) from various parts of Scotland, entertained Professor Dick to a public dinner in the Waterloo Hotel. John Lambert, Esq. in the Chair, and Alexander Gordon, jun Esq. croupier. The stewards were Ed. Pyper, Esq. of West Craigs, J. R. Laing, Esq. jun of Dunkenny, Samuel Wordsworth, jun. Esq. W.S., Dr Malcolm, James Miller, Esq. and George Rennie, Esq.– Amongst the gentlemen present we observed Professors Low and Lizars ; Drs Robertson, Spittal, Knox, and Aitken, Mr Ferguson, surgeon ; J. B. Murdoch, Esq. of Coldoch; Charles Gordon, Esq. Secretary to the Highland Society of Scotland ; A. T. Blackwood, Esq. of Oggs Castle ; Mr Dick, senior &c. The cloth having been removed and the usual loyal toasts drank, the chairman, in a neat and appropriate speech, proposed the health of Professor Dick, to whom the present meeting had assembled to do honour, and who at once commanded their esteem as a member of society and their admiration as a man of talent, which toast was drank with the greatest enthusiasm. The chairman then proposed his Grace the Duke of Gordon and the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, Patrons of the Edinburgh Veterinary College, which was followed by a variety of other appropriate toasts. Many excellent songs were sung, and the conviviality of the evening was kept up until a late hour.*Royal Infirmary* –We understand that the Stewards of the late Fancy Ball for the benefit of the Royal Infirmary have, by their judicious arrangements in the management of the ball, been enabled to pay over to the trustees of that institution, (after deducting all expenses) the sum of t432, 7s. 8d. The managers of the Infirmary, as well as the public at large, are certainly much indebted to the gentlemen who acted as stewards upon that occasion, for their valuable extertions, particularly at the present time, in support of this great and useful institution, for the relief of those labouring under the united calamities of indigence and disease.

Papers from Madras to the 17th of January have been received. Accounts had arrived through Singapore, from the ship Mangles, stating that when passing through Torres Straits she touched at Murray's Island, where they discovered eight Europeans, part of the crew of the long-missing bark, Charles Eaton, in a state of slavery, but the natives would not deliver up the men. The Charles Eaton was supposed to have been lost on the Barrier Reef, in Torres Straits, in 1833, in prosecution of her voyage from New South Wales to Madras, but no precise intelligence of her fate was previously known. The ironworks which had been erected at Porto Novo were proceeding with activity, and some railing had been made there, quite equal, it is stated to anything og the kind manufactured in England.

Every thing is jobbed Female Emigration to Australia, &c. *(From a Correspondent.)*Our penal settlements appear to be very indifferently managed; and we are glad to find that such a man as Sir John Franklin is appointed to govern Van Diemen's Land; and the sooner an improved system is adopted for New South Wales, the better. Not only are men sent out to govern who are ignorant of human nature, a knowledge of which is essential to the management of the heterogenous materials of our penal colonies; but when the Government at home opens its eyes to any proposal for improvement,it is mismanaged. Our rulers have the sense to see the importance of sending our respectable females to these colonies ; but they trust an Emigration Committee, and this committee trusts individuals who desire to make the most of the concern ; and we are glad to have an opportunity of making the public acquainted with the mode in which the business is conducted, in the hope that some humane Member of Parliament will take the subject up. The mode of managing female emigration is this :–A temptation, in the first place, is held out of a free passage to Australia. A ship is hired, and this ship must ave a *full*  cargo, to satisfy the *owners. *Advertisements are issued, and instead of hard working females, a parcel of decayed governesses, dressmakers, &c. &c., with a small mixture of better articles, is made up. But if, as almost always happens, a sufficient number of these to fill the ship does not come forward, a supply of sweepings is taken from a workhouse! Here, then, is such a mixture of good, bad, and indifferent, to the amount of two hundred and upwards, that there is enough of evil to corrupt the good. As to the comfort of the poor creatures they are crammed four into one bed  !Such is the power of jobbing, that we happen to know the fact, that some young women of respectability who wished to go to New South Wales *with their **friends*, were refused a free passage, unless they went to London to go in the Government ship ! Thus we see that the interests of agents and shipowners overcomes the interests of the colonies, and actually obstructs the attainment of the object in view. We find blindness a very common ailment in every department of Government ; and however desirous our rulrs may be to reform every abuse, and to adopt useful measures, they are often thwarted by the necessity (which ought not to exist) of conciliating harpies and leeches, which devour the public substance, and suck the public blood. Reform has, as yet, only begun to clean the outside of the platter ; and it may not reach the inside in our day. It is the duty, however, of all patriots, to sharpen the knife that is to cut out corruption from the heart of the commonwealth, by means of exposure of every abuse that comes to be known, and to support those who are willing to apply it.As in a matter of so much importance nothing should be concealed, there is no hesitation in stating that it consists with our knowledge that, after the Emigration Committee in Van Diemen's Land, detailing the deplorable consequences of sending out young women from workhouses, a ship has actually sailed, nearly filled up as we have described. When any representation is made to a public office, the matter is said to belong to another department ; and that other department says it is not its province to interfere ; and thus humanity is made the shuttlecock to the battledore of jobbing and the blindness of office.If our brethren of the press will take up this, the inhuman job will be put an end to.

Emigration Mr Walter  moved, pursuant to notice, that "an humble address be presented to his Majesty, praying that he will be graciously pleased to issue his royal orders that a placard entitled "Emigration to Van Diemen's Land," which the several postmasters throughout the kingdom have been directed to put in a conspicuous place in their several post-offices, and to circulate among the clergy and the parochial authorities be withdrawn." He had been assured y several gentlemen who had returned from Van Diemen's land, that many of the young females sent out by the Emigration committee had been irrevocable consigned to prostitution, and that such as obtained services found themselves placed among a very different calss of persons to that which they had been accustomed to mix with in this country. The hon. member read an extract from a Hobart Town paper, of the 19th of February last, in which it was stated that some of the females "thus launched into the world," were not more than twelve of thirteen years old.Mr Wakley  seconded the motion. Sir G. Grey  adverted to the extraordinary object of the address, when the information desired had in fact already been given on a former day. He hoped, whatever information, correct or erroneous, might be circulated on the subject of emigration, that the people of England would not adopt their notions from anonymous paragraphs in Hobart Town newspapers. According to the hon. member there was a system in operation by which people were driven out of the country–actually turned out of it, as if they were so many slaves. Now he could declare that there could be no more unfounded statement than this. Though much good had arisen to the colonies and individuals, yet it could not be denied that, in some instances, youn women had turned out badly They had these facts upon authority–that many of those females obtained respectable places. The names of the individuals who obtained them, the dates of their arrival, the mode of their meployment, were all to be found int he papers on the table of the house. In conclusion, he begged of the hon. member and others, when statements relative to emigration were made, to receive them with caution and reserve.Mr C. Lushington  defended the proceedigs of the Emigration Committee. he mainted that by their labours the greatest posible good had been accomplished, hear, hear.) He would then ask of any one to look at the names of the gentlemen who were on that committee–to look at their characters; and could any one who did so believe that the members of that committee would be guilty of the sin of sendng out, day after day, young females to the colonies–of thus duping those unprotected creatures to their destruction? (hear, hear.)Mr Walter  replied. He had not relied for his statements upon newspapers, but upon official documents.The motion was negatived without a division.

State of Trade.*The Wool Trade, London, Thursday Evening.* –The following are more accurate averages of the sales of Colonial Wools which have recently taken place than we were enabled to obtain during their progress.The Colonial Wools offered consisted of 2041 bays. The Wools have become much improved in growth, in length of staple, in management, and in washing. The market being very bare in combining wool, this description realized a proportionate advance. Several flocks attracted great attention, particularly those market T A in a square, I X and Y, which show that great pains have been paid by the growers upon them. The correct averages obtained are as follows :–Van Diemen's Land.s. d. s. d. Choice flocks T A in a square 2 9 to 3 1 per lb. Do. I X 2 0 1/2 2 9 Do. Y 1 8 2 9 Good flocks 2 2 3/4 2 9 1/2 Ordinary and fair quality 1 4 1/2 2 2 1/2 Inferior and in the great 1 2 1 4AustralianGood flocks 2 6 2 9 Fair 2 3 1/2 2 5 Inferior 1 11 2 2 and in the grease 1 3The frist class of Van Diemen's Land Wool realised a considerable rise upon last year's sales, the produce of the same flocks then selling only at 2s 2d to 2s 5d per lb.The Wool Trade is very brisk. The arrivals this week have been 2300 bales, of which about 340 are German, 1000 Spanish, 300 New South Wales, 20 Cape of Good Hope, 50 Turkey, and 500 bales of South American Woo's.*Huddersfield, Tuesday*.–There has been no visible change in the state of this market for the last three or four weeks. Business in general is pretty good.*Bradford, June*  30.–The activity we have so often had to report in the piece market continues unabated, and in six quarters, especially low and middle sorts, trade to-day is particularly brisk. Whatever alteration there may be in the yarn market, as compared with recent reports, is for the better. Stocks continue low in the staplers' hands, with very little disposition to increase them. Prices remain very steady, although the demand for wool is extremely limited. Farmers are rather firmer. The Liverpool sales of New South Wales Wool went off 1d to 2d per lb. above the recent London sales.*Rochdale, June*  27.–The market this week was very well attended, but not so brisk as the last.–Low goods were much in demand, and sold well. The trade in Rochdale is generally good at present, and building is going on to a very considerale extent.*York Wool Market, June*  30.–The quantity of wool brought to this day's market, was not so large as that supplied last week, nor was the attendance of buyers so numerous, yet a considerable portion of business was done, and last week's quotations were fully supported :–good, bred hog 18 1/2d ; half hog and ewe, 16 1/2d to 17d ; all ewe, 15d to 15 1/2d ; locks without cots 10 1/2 to 11 1/2d ; ditto with cots 11d to 12 1/2d per lb.

South AustraliaWe  have received the first annual Report of new colony of South Australia, a Parliamentary paper presented in June last. The site selected for the colony is a part of the south coast of New Holland, extending two or three hundred miles on each side of Spencer's Gulf, and about 600 miles into the interior. It was anticipated that the best central station would be Port Lincoln at the entrance of Spencer's Gulf, on the west side, or Nepean Bay, on the north coast of Kangaroo Isle. Port Lincoln is in latitude 35, and east longitude 136, about 700 miles right west from Sydney, the same distance north-west from Van Diemen's Land, and about 1000 miles eastward of the colony at King George's Sound. Nepean Bay is about 100 miles east from Port Lincoln. The colony is established under Parliamentary Commissioners, as an experiment, we believe, to try whether it may not be possible to execute an extensive plan of emigration without any charge to the country, by selling lots of land at such a price as would defray the expense of conveying the emigrants from England. The plan adopted is, to send out preferably young married persons under thirty, and to admit no slaves or convicts into the colony. A company has embarked t35,000 in the enterprise. A surveying vessel was sent out in March to examine the coast carefully, that the best site might be chosen at first, and the necessity of removal avoided. Six vessels altogether had sailed down to the 1st May, carrying out 152 male labourers with 37 females, and 26 male and 10 females of a superior class. These numbers include 26 children. The Commissioners attempted at first to get 20s. per acre for the land ; but finding it impossible, they reduced the price to 12s. By selling at this price 437 lots, consisting each of a country section of 134 acres, and a town section of one acre, they had raised the t35,000 required by the act of Parliament as the condition of the grant of land. We give these few details to put our readers in a condition to understand the notices which appear from time to time in the papers respecting the colony. We hope the Commissioners or the adventurers will give the country a distinctive name. The title of "South Australia" is bad any way, and even positively absurd ; since Australia ( *quasi*  Australasia,) originally intended for New Holland, has already begun to be monopolised by Van Diemen's Land. The district at Spencer's Gulf, if it is to participated in the general denomination, should be termed "North" rather than "South" Australia. By the way, most of our colonies in that quarter of the world have ridiculous names, as is instantly perceived when we coin a nationa term for the people out of them. What can be worse than a "Van Diemen-lander ;" a "New South-Wales-ian ;" a "Swan River-ite ;" or a "King-George's Soundian ! !"
