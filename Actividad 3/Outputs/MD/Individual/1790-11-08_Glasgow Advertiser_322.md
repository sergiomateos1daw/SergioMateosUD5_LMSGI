 When hostilities are once commenced, a forfidable armament will unquestionable be sent against the Spanish South American colonies. Of its success there cannot be a doubt, when we shall be aided by an army of 20,000 Indian warriors, beside the active support of those Mexicans now ??? under the tyranous yoke of Spain. So determined are the Cherokees, the Creeks, and other nations of Indians in the Southern parts of America, to strip the Spaniards of their possessions on that Continent, that they will unquestionably attempt the glorious achievement, even though the policy of this country should prevent us from lending them effectual assistance.The rich silver mines at Potosi, in Peru, were accidentally discovered in 1545, by an Indian, as he was clambering up the mountain, in pursuit of a Lama, which had strayed from his flock. Soon after, the mines, of Sacotecas, in New Spain, little inferior to the other in value, were opened. From that time successive discoveries have been made in both colonies, and silver mines are now so numerous that the working of them, and of some few mines of gold in the provinces of Terra Firm, and the new Kingdom of Grenada, has become the capital occupation of the Spaniards, and is reduced into the system no less complicated than interesting.
