 The Indian Chiefs lately arrived in town are six in number. They have been indiscriminately styled Cherokees, but three of them only are of that nation, and three are Creek Indians.â€“They are all handsome men, not exceeding in age twenty - five or twenty-six. These six Chiefs have 20,000 warriors ready to take the field, and have the strongest wish to act in conjunction with the English. They travelled 3000 miles before the reached Halifax, and were near 12 months in performing the journey. From Halifax they went in an English frigate to Quebec to Lord Dorchester, by whom they were sent over to England to concert their plans in person with the Ministry.The object of their coming to this country may be easily guessed at. They long to make an attack upon the Spanish settlements. One of them was heard last night in the playhouse to say, he hoped in six months from this time to be in the heart of Mexico.
