*Emigration.* â€“The *Venus*  steam-boar left the Steam Packet Wharf, St Katherine's Dock, yesterday morning, with from 230 to 240 female emigrants to take their passage on board the ship Canton, for Sydney. The emigrants were, for the most part, fine healthy looking girls, some of them of exceedingly interesting appearance, and almost all of a class much above that in which the distress which prompts to emigration would be supposed to exist.
