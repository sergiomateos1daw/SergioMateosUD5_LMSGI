Portsmouth, June 5. –This day the ship *William Shand,* Captain Kerr, arrived direct from Port Jackson, New South Wales, which place she left on the 1st of February, not having touched any where, and made her voyage round Cape Horn in four months and five days. She has a full cargo of wool and sea oil ; the former principally the produce of the flocks of Mr Macarther, and is much improved in fineness, in better condition for market, and is altogether superior to the first class of Spanish wool.–Trade was toletably brisk at all our settlements in that quarter, and the crops had been productive.
