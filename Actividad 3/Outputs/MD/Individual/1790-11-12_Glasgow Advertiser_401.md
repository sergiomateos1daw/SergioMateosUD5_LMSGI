Extract of a letter from Martinique, Sept. 12." A singular revolution has taken place at Martinique. The Governor, Viscount Damas, with the troops, had taken possession of St. Pierre's; having established peace, as they concluded, they retired to Fort Bourbon; the patriots again at ??ed, have suprised and taken the fort. The governor has escaped with a company of grenadiers, and it is reported he is since joined by about five hundred people of colour."
