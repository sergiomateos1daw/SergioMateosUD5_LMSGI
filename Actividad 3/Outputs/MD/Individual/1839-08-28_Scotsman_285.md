First Scotch Colony for New Zealand – A numerous party of emigrants, under this title, are now making the necessary arrangements for embarking in the Bengal Merchant, to sail from Greenock in September. The committee for the west of Scotland, and their agents, are now employed in selecting eligible persons as settlers, and, judging from the number of applications, the directors will be called on to send a second vessel from the Clyde. A clergyman of the Scotch Church, who accompanies the colony, will officiate as chaplain on board. It is intended that the Clude shall be made the principal shipping port of Scotland for New Zealand, and that the strictest regulations shall be put in force in order to ensure the comfort, safety, and convenience of the passengers.– *New Zealand Gazette.*
