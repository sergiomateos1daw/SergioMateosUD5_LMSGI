*Extract of a letter from New York, Aug.*  3."Our harvest is over westward and through the southern counties of this State. This week will finish it in the northern, and I am confident we have not had so fine a crop since 1774, and all gathered without a drop of rain, which will render wheat fit for exportation in OCtober. The Summer grains are also abundant, and those on the ground, especially Indian corn, equally promising. Should Europe require wheat at even two thirds of the prices given last year, we shall draw a very large balance from them in specie.The public debt of this country having in course of a few days been funded, brought many foreigners into deep speculations, which reduced bills of exchange to par.
