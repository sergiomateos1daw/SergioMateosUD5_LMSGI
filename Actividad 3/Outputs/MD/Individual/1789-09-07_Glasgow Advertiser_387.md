Slaves in the West Indies.*Spes addita suscitat iras*, Hope inflames resentment. Vengeance against the injuries we have inflicted on the Negroes, when they are inflamed with the hope of emancipation, will be livelier than gratitude for freedom to which they are entitled in justice. The insurrections among the slaves in the French West India islands form a dismal presage of what we may expect in our own. We have managed this business not like men of sense, concerned in a general welfare of the British empire, but with the pedantry and precipitation of school boys.
