*Swan River.* –The fine ship *Gilmore*, purchased by Mr T. Peel, brother to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, proceeded down the river on Saturday, on her voyage to Swan River. The *Gilmore *quitted the St Catherine Docks in the course of Friday, having on board an excellent assortment of every requisite which may be required to form the new settlement. Mr Thomas Peel has had the *Gilmore*, which is of 500 tons burthen, under his own inspection, as well as the selection of the agricultural and other implements to convey to the Swan River. There were many passengers on board. Mr Peel and his family, it is understood will join the vessel at Plymouth. In the vessel there are also going out other settlers. The *Hooghly*, another ship of 500 tons burthen, chartered by the same individual, is not yet quite ready for her voyage. Among the valuables sent out to Swan River are some fine race-horses, intended for breeding in the settlement, from whence India will be supplied, should the settlement answer.– *Sunday Times.*
