It was further said that his Lordship has passed Guayaquil oh his way to Chili. Almost a forthnight ago, intelligence reached the Governor of Carthagena, from Santa Fe, that General Bolivar, who had been joined by one of Murillo's Generals, with a number of troops, was making rapid advances towards Santa Fe with upwards of 5000 men ; and it was expected the next courier would announce[?] the fall of that place. An Aide-deCamp of the Governor of that place arrived at Carthagena at midnight with the above information. Another account states, that the Venezuelian army, under General Bolivar in person, had obtained possession of Santa Fe, and that his advanced guard was at Honda[?] ; he had succeeded in cutting off the retreat of General Samana[?], the Captain-General of Santa Fe ; his Secretary, Ramirez, has arrived at Carthagena with the above intelligence ; it was also added that a part of Bolivar's army would soon be in Mempaz[?].There have arrived at the port of Quebec, this present season 9,513 settlers.A letter from Demerara of the 14th August says that a severe shock of an earthquake had been felt in that colony for the first time since the memory of man[?].

The funeral took place on Sunday evening, with the honours due to his rank ; and is remains were attended to the place of internment by a numerous assemblage of his friends at the Presidency. Mr Duncan's valuable services were for mroe than 30 years devoted to the benefit of the public, and the relief of suffering humanity[?] ; and during the whole of that period, it may be truly said, that he always evinced a firm, humane[?], and honourable disposition, the remembrance of which must render his memory universally respected."Calcutta, March 24. "A Treaty has been concluded by the Hon. Sir Stamford Raffles[?], on the part of the Most Noble the Governor-General, with the Sultan of Jahore and Tomangong of Sincapore, establishing a British Residency at the latter place, under Major Furqubar, with a settlement on the ruins of the ancient captial of that country, over which, we may congratulate our readers, that the British flag is now flying ; Sir S. Raffles having returned from this expedition to Penang[?] on the 4th of last month. The grant of this island, which is situated at the southern extremity of the Peninsula of Malacca[?] must become valuable to the British Government, especially when accompanied, as we understand that it is, with the privilege of establishing further settlements along the extensive coast of Jahore, which must afford considerable protection to our commerce in that quarter, particularly to ships passing through the Straits, and enable us to watch the proceedings of our Bataxian competitors.*Cape Town Gazettes*  to the 1st of August have come to our hands. At the present moment, when plans for colonising the territory adjoining the Cape of Good Hope, occupy so much attention, we turn to these papers with peculiar anxiety. They, however, contain little notice of public events at the Cape ; and nothing whatever is said of the incursions of the Caffres. We collect incidentally, that the scarcity which lately prevailed at the Cape has entirely ceased ; ample supplies of wheat and flour having lately been imported or brought to market.Maritime IntelligenceFriday, a Court Martial was assembled on board the Queen Charlotte, in Portsmouth harbour, and continued by adjournment during Saturday, to inquire into the circumstances of the supposed concealment of two deserters from the band of the 18th regiment of foot on board his Majesty's ships Phaeton[?], Captain W.
