Deputation of Distressed Weavers. â€“The distress of the Paisley weavers has caused them to send a deputation to London, which, on Tuesday, waited on Lord John Russell, to solicit the means of transporting themselves out of the ungrateful country which has been enriched by their toils, and, in return, refuses them the means of subsistence. Their prayer was to be sent to New Zealand. The answer was, that Government will, next session, bring forward some general measure on the subject, but in the mean time cannot help them.
