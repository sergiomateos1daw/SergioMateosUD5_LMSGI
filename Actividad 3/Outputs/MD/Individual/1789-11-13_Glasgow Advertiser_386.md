*Extract of a letter from a gentleman at Dumfries, in Virginia, to his correspondent in Glasgow, dated 3d October, 1789.*"Yesterday morning we had a frost, by which a very considerable part of the growing tobacco, twenty miles from the rivers, was killed, then the Mercury was at 35 to a northern exposure in the open air; this morning it stood at 27, and every tender vegetable in the gardens here is destoryed."
