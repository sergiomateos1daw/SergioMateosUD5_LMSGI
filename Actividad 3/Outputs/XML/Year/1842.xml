                <p>
               <pb/>There is something curious in the preference <lb/>which the emigrants from England, Scotland, and <lb/>Ireland display for different localities. The pro<lb break="no"/>portions emigrating the countries below are as <lb/>follows:–</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigrants </hi>
               <lb/>English Per cent. Scottish Per cent. Irish Per Cent. <lb/>To United States, 54, 14 1/2, 12 <lb/>– Sydney, 17, 21 1/2, 7 <lb/>– Canada, 8 1/2, 25, 50 <lb/>– Port-Philip, 8, 14, 7</p>
                <p>As the table expressly bears to be " a return of <lb/>the persons who have <hi rend="italic">emigrated</hi>," we can scarcely <lb/>suppose that it includes persons who went out to <lb/>the countries mentioned on business, without any <lb/>intention of settling. In the report for Canada, <lb/>the number who went to the United States in <lb/>1841, is stated to be only 32,500, or about two<lb break="no"/> thirds of what stands in the above table.</p>
                <p>It will be observed, that not a single emigrant <lb/>to India or Ceylon appears in the table; yet sure<lb break="no"/>ly some persons go with the express view of re<lb break="no"/>maining in these countries.</p>
                <p>The number of person who were enabled to <lb/>emigrate in 1841 by means of bounties payable in <lb/>the colonies, was, for New South Wales 22,752, <lb/>for Van Diemen's Land 331. It must be remem<lb break="no"/>bered that New South Wales includes Port<lb break="no"/>Philip.</p>
                <p>There are returns of land sold, but not in a <lb/>very perfect form. In Canada, in the year 1839, <lb/>1840, and 1841, the lands sold were 176,518 acres. <lb/>The average price was 3s. to 3s. 8d. in Lower, and <lb/>12s. to 13s. in Upper Canada; the lands granted <lb/>without sale were 194,000 acres, exclusive of those <lb/>for Lower Canada in 1841. In Nova Scotia, New <lb/>Brunswick, and Cape Breton, about 200,000 acres <lb/>have been sold at prices varying from 2s. 3d. to <lb/>3s. 8d. The lands granted are inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>At the Cape, 129,000 acres have been sold in the <lb/>three years, at prices from 2s. 5d. to 3s. 3d.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Lands sold in New South Wales </hi>
               <lb/>Acres. Average Price. <lb/>Sydney District–1839, 234,272, 8s 2 1/2d. <lb/>1840, 105,900, 18s. 8 1/2d. <lb/>1841, 15,790, 20s. 0 1/2d. <lb/>Port-Philip–1839, 38,343 36s. 6 1/2d. <lb/>1840, 83,687, 51s. 11 3/4d. <lb/>(Six months)–, 53,733, 20s. 0d. <lb/>531,930</p>
                <p>The sales were chiefly by auction.</p>
                <p>In Van Diemen's Land, the sales in 1839, 1840, <lb/>were about 130,000 acres, at 10s. or 11s.; in West<lb break="no"/>ern Australia (Swan River), in 1839, 1840, 1841, <lb/>the sales were 71,000 acres, from 6s. 1d. to 11s.; in <lb/>South Australia, 55,000 acres, at 20s. The sales <lb/>of land are no bad index of the progress of the <lb/>colonies in capital and cultivation; and, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to this criterion, it will be seen, that those <lb/>which were advancing most rapidly in the three <lb/>years, were Sydney and Port-Philip. The money <lb/>received in payment of land in these two colonies <lb/>in 1839 and 1840, amounted to t307,647; and, if <lb/>we understand the report correctly, the whole of <lb/>this sum is applicable to emigration, that is, to <lb/>defraying the expense of carrying out emigrants.</p>
                <p>The 118,592 emigrants probably carried with <lb/>them, or expended on their passage, twenty <lb/>pounds each; and thus the money which left the <lb/>country must have amounted to upwards of two <lb/>millions.</p>
                <p>This gigantic emigration one of the things <lb/>which convey an idea of the immense resources of <lb/>Britain. The United Kingdom contains only the <lb/>ninth part of the population of Europe; and we <lb/>believe it may be safely said, that all the other <lb/>eight parts do not send out half the number of <lb/>emigrants annually which are sent by the British <lb/>Isles alone.</p>

                <p>The Company was established and incorporated <lb/>(and is now in full operation) to carry out in Aus<lb break="no"/>tralia a principle which has been acted on with great <lb/>success elsewhere, namely, that of taking up money <lb/>in this country, at a moderate rate of interest, on <lb/>the credit of a large invested capital, and laying it <lb/>out on undoubted freehold security, at a higher rate.</p>
                <p>The Company is now prepared to grant transferable <lb/>notes, under the Corporation seal, to persons desirous <lb/>of advancing Money to the Company on loan. The <lb/>notes will be for t100 each, or any larger sum desired <lb/>by the lender, and will be made payable at any period <lb/>which may be agreed upon, not being shorter than <lb/>two years. The notes will bear interest at the rate <lb/>of five per cent, per annum, payable half-yearly (on <lb/>the 15th January and 15th July), on the production <lb/>of the half-yearly vouchers, which will be annexed <lb/>to each note: these vouchers, or coupons, will render <lb/>it unnecessary for the holder of a note to present the <lb/>note itself until the principal becomes due. The <lb/>form of note has been preferred to that of bond, as <lb/>admitting of transfer without expense or trouble, <lb/>whilst it affords equal security to the holder.</p>
                <p>The Colonial Board has been established in Syd<lb break="no"/>ney, and the operation of the Company are at pre<lb break="no"/>sent confined to New South Wales.</p>
                <p>Security being the first object of the Company, all <lb/>the arrangements have been framed with the view to <lb/>attain that end.</p>
                <p>The Loans are made at a fixed interest of 10 per <lb/>cent, although the current rate is much higher. <lb/>The land mortgaged (exclusive of collateral se<lb break="no"/>curity) must not be of less value than double <lb/>the amount of the loan. <lb/>The non-payment of interest on the day it be<lb break="no"/>comes due, subjects the mortgager to 2 1/2 per <lb/>cent, additional interest for the period in ar<lb break="no"/>rear; and all parties in default for ten days <lb/>are to be proceeded against the Solicitor of <lb/>the Company "without further instructions" <lb/>and "without distinction or exception of any <lb/>person whatever." <lb/>The Colonial Board only draws on the Company, <lb/>as loans are agreed on; their bills must be ad<lb break="no"/>vertised for public competition and the pur<lb break="no"/>chasers pay the amount, in exchange for the <lb/>Bill, to the Bank of Australasia (the Capital <lb/>of which is t1,200,00) to the credit of the <lb/>Company, to be drawn out by checks of <lb/>the Colonial Board in favour of the borrow<lb break="no"/>ers as the mortgages are completed.</p>
                <p>The high character of the members of the Colonial <lb/>Board, affords the fullest assurance that these ar<lb break="no"/>rangements will be strictly adhered to in spirit as <lb/>well as in form; no difficulty has been experienced <lb/>in investing the full monthly amount sanctioned by <lb/>the instructions of the Court of Directors: indeed the <lb/>Chairman of the Colonial Board states that "he does <lb/>not entertain the smallest doubt of a safe investment <lb/>of all the funds which may be placed at the disposal <lb/>of the Colonial Board."</p>
                <p>The high rate of interest in Australia, has at<lb break="no"/>tracted much private capital from this country to be <lb/>invested in mortgages. These investments have <lb/>been made through the agency of individuals or mer<lb break="no"/>cantile firms, and therefore subject to contingencies <lb/>from which the Company is exempt. To those who <lb/>may desire to make such investments, it must be ob<lb break="no"/>vois that the stock of the Company presents a much <lb/>superior security, and the prospect of a greatly in<lb break="no"/>creased return, inasmuch as the Company derives a <lb/>large profit by lending at 10 per cent in Australia, <lb/>the money borrowed here at half that rate.</p>
                <p>It is equally clear that those who merely seek tem<lb break="no"/>porary employment for their money without becoming <lb/>shareholders, cannot have a better security than the <lb/>Promissory Notes of the Company, for the due pay<lb break="no"/>ment of which, the whole capital of the Company, <lb/>as well as the mortgages on which the money is laid <lb/>out, stand pledged. Every shareholder is required <lb/>to execute in a Deed of Covenant, by which he becomes <lb/>bound to pay to the full amount of his shares, and the <lb/>Charter supplies Creditors with the utmost facility <lb/>in enforcing demands against the Company. When <lb/>it is considered that the funds of the Company <lb/>here are kept in Government Securities and no <lb/>money lent in Australia, except on the best mort<lb break="no"/>gages on land, with collateral security in addition, <lb/>it may be fairly asserted, that in many respects the <lb/>Promissory Notes are entitled to a decided prefe<lb break="no"/>rence over mortgages in this country, which gene<lb break="no"/>rally bear one per cent. less interest than that paid <lb/>by the Company.</p>
                <p>The Charter provides that the sums borrowed <lb/>shall not exceed four times the amount of capital <lb/>paid up.</p>
                <p>That the whole capital of the Company, and all <lb/>the mortgages on which their money is lent, in Aus<lb break="no"/>tralia, shall constitute a security to the lenders of <lb/>money to the Company.</p>
                <p>That the mortgages are to be on land, with the <lb/>power of taking collateral security on stock, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>That every mortgage shall be registered–the re<lb break="no"/>gister to contain such particulars as the Governor <lb/>of the colony may deem necessary.</p>
                <p>That a copy of the register of the mortgages <lb/>shall be kept at the office of the Company, in Lon<lb break="no"/>don, for the information of the share-holders and <lb/>lenders.</p>
                <p>That an annual report be made to the Lords of the <lb/>Treasury of all sums borrowed by the Company, and <lb/>of the appropriation of them.</p>
