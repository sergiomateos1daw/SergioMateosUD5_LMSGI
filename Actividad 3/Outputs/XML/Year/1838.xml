               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration</hi>
            </p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi>  Annual Report on Emigration just issued <lb/>contains, besides the usual, correspondences and <lb/>documents connected with the plan which has been <lb/>some time in operation, of transferring labourers from <lb/>India to the Mauritius, and which it is now proposed <lb/>to extend to New South Wales. Leaving this sub<lb break="no"/>jest for the present, we shall state the general results[?] <lb/>of the emigration to Canada.</p>
                <p>The Report shows, that the whole number of <lb/>emigrants who landed at Quebec or Montreal, in the <lb/>last nine years, was 259,788[?], averaging very nearly <lb/>29,000 per annum. The years of greatest emigration <lb/>were 1831 and 1832, the numbers for these years be<lb break="no"/>ing respectively 50,254 and 51,746. The proportions[?] [?] <lb/>furnished by the three kingdoms in the nine years <lb/>were as follows :–Among eight emigrants there were <lb/>five Irishmen, two Englishmen, and one Scotsman. <lb/>Scotland in proportion to its population has sent off <lb/>three times as many emigrants, and Ireland about <lb/>nine times as may as England; and it should be <lb/>added, that a certain part of the emigration from <lb/>England is artificial, consisting of paupers sent out at <lb/>the expense of their parishes. Emigrations offers the <lb/>most natural, practicable, and safe means of relieving a <lb/>country of its redundant or unemployed population ; <lb/>and it may be asked, why it is so much less resorted to <lb/>in England than in Scotland and Ireland? It cannot[?] <lb/>be the ignorance of the English, for this would lead <lb/>to the inference that the Irish, who emigrate in the <lb/>largest numbers, were the best informed of the three <lb/>nations. It is, we apprehend, nothing but the Poor <lb/>Laws, which hold out to the labourer the certainty of <lb/>a subsistence at home, however idle or improvident he <lb/>may be, and render him averse to live in the colo<lb break="no"/>nies, where he would have no such resource. This is <lb/>only one of the many evils which these laws have pro<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>duced, not only to the country at large, but to the la<lb break="no"/>bouring classes themselves, whose average condition <lb/>was greatly deteriorated, while only a fraction of their <lb/>number shared the benefit of the allowance. We <lb/>speak of the Poor Laws as they existed before the Act <lb/>of 1834 was passed.</p>
                <p>The number of emigrants who went to Canada <lb/>last year was 21,901, of whom 1399 went from <lb/>Scotland, 5580 from England, 14,538 from <lb/>Ireland, and 274 from Nova Scotia, Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, or the West Indies. In 1836 the number of <lb/>emigrants was 27,728. The ports in Scotland from <lb/>which the greatest numbers sail are Greenock, Leith, <lb/>Aberdeen, and Cromarty. Of the emigrants in 1837, <lb/>4000 settled in Lower Canada, 16,300 in Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>da, 1500 went to the United States, and ninety-two <lb/>died in the hospital or quarantine station.</p>
                <p>In the same period of nine years, 236,288[?] British <lb/>emigrants have landed at new York, or fully 26,000 <lb/>per annum on average. There is a great fluctua-[?] <lb/>tion in the number. In 1833 and 1835 it was only <lb/>16,000 ; in 1837 it was 34,000 ; in 1836 no less than <lb/>59,075 ; and addingthe 27,728 who went to Canada, <lb/>no less than 86,800 persons must have landed at New <lb/>York and Quebec from the British Isles in [?]. <lb/>There is a discrepancy, however, between this account <lb/>and another in a different Return, also newly pub<lb break="no"/>lished. The Report of the "Agent-General for Emi<lb break="no"/>gration," makes the number who went to the United <lb/>States from Britain in 1836, only 37,774. The for<lb break="no"/>mer probably comprehends all British born subjects, <lb/>including persons from Nova Scotia, Canada, and the <lb/>West Indies, and probably all passengers, many of <lb/>whom returned.</p>
                <p>The Agent-General gives the number of persons <lb/>who emigrated to the British Colonies and the United <lb/>States for every year since 1825. We present merely <lb/>the average for the last year seven years.</p>
                <p>Annual number of Emigrants from Britain to <lb/>North American Colonies, 39[?],00 <lb/>Ditto do. to United States, 34,[?]00 <lb/>Ditto do. to Cape of Good Hope, 20[?] <lb/>Ditto do. to Australian Colonies, 3[?]0 <lb/>73[?],[?]</p>
                <p>In 1832, the number who emigrated to these Colo<lb break="no"/>nies was no less than 103,140. The number who <lb/>went out to Australia in 1837, was much greater than <lb/>in any preceding year, being 5054.</p>
                <p>If we assume that each emigrant pays for his pas<lb break="no"/>sage, &amp;c., or has in his pocket t30, the average net[?] <lb/>expended on emigration will be about two millions per <lb/>annum. It may be correctly stated now, that human <lb/>beings form no inconsiderable <hi rend="italic">item</hi>, in number and <lb/>value, of our exports. In the case of Ireland we sup<lb break="no"/>pose it is by far the most flourishing, and by no means <lb/>the least advantageous branch of the national com<lb break="no"/>merce.</p>
                <p>The annual increment of the population of <lb/>British Isles is about 330,000, independently of the <lb/>efflux by emigration ; but including this, it must be <lb/>about 420,000. It follows that there are about [?] <lb/>more inhabitants in the country each day than there <lb/>were on the day before. Of the 1150 additional mortals[?] <lb/>emigration carries off 200.</p>
                <p>The establishment of steam navigation across the <lb/>Atlantic will, no doubt, give a new impulse to the <lb/>circulation of human beings, while the construction of <lb/>railroads across the Alleganies, and of canals in Canada, <lb/>will greatly increase the capacity of the western world <lb/>to absorb the imported multitudes. In seven years <lb/>hence, the journey from London to Missouri will be <lb/>shorter in point of time, and perhaps cheaper, than the <lb/>journey from Washington to Missouri was seven years <lb/>ago. A religious man might see something like the <lb/>finger of Providence in the fact, that just at the time <lb/>France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, <lb/>begin to feel severely the pressure of a redundant po<lb break="no"/>pulation, inventions have started into existence which <lb/>may be said to annihilate space, and bring the most <lb/>thinly inhabited parts of the world, into juxtaposition <lb/>with the most overpeopled.</p>
                <p>From the American Almanac, we find that the num<lb break="no"/>ber of passengers who arrived in the United States in <lb/>1836, was 81,000, of whom 4000 were native Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans. The proportion of emigrants from the different <lb/>foreign countries was–</p>
                <p>From the British Isles, 47,792 <lb/>... British American Colonies, 2,681 <lb/>... Germany, 20,142 <lb/>... France, 4,443 <lb/>... Prussia, 563 <lb/>... Switzerland, 465 <lb/>... Denmark, 414 <lb/>... Holland, 298 <lb/>... Mexico, 797 <lb/>... Texas, 698 <lb/>... Cuba, 516 <lb/>... Other countries, 2,152</p>
                <p>Some curious inferences might be drawn from this <lb/>table, as to the motives which induce men to leave <lb/>their native country. <hi rend="italic">Celeris paribus</hi>, there is most <lb/>emigration where there is most intelligence. Thus, <lb/>Spain, Portugal, Sardinia, Naples, the Papal States, <lb/>and Austria, furnish no emigrants to American, while <lb/>Britain and Germany furnish a vast number. Much, <lb/>however, must depend on the domestic condition of <lb/>the country, and on the greater or less facilities for <lb/>removing. Thus, considering its inland position, and <lb/>the small number of its inhabitants, the spirit of emi<lb break="no"/>gration must be much more active in Switzerland, <lb/>which sends out 445 persons, than in France, which <lb/>sends out 4443.</p>
                <p>The magistrates of New York, it appears, con<lb break="no"/>sider the influx of emigrants a nuisance, and it <lb/>would seem, from an expression of Mr Buchanan's, the <lb/>agent at Quebec, that they had laid a tax of ten dol<lb break="no"/>lars upon all who arrive with an intention of settling. <lb/>The key to this proceeding is no doubt to be found in <lb/>the following facts. A Board of Aldermen reported in <lb/>June last, that the expense of City Almshouses in the <lb/>preceding year were 205,500 dollars, or t44,000 ; that <lb/>of 1209 persons admitted in a certain period, 932 were <lb/>aliens ; and that the whole number under the charge <lb/>of the Commissioners was 3074, of whom three-fourths <lb/>were foreigners. A communication from the Mayor <lb/>at the same time says:–" Nearly 2000 emigrants arrive <lb/>each week ; our streets are filled with the wandering <lb/>crowds of those passengers, clustering in our city, <lb/>unaccustomed to our climate, without money, without <lb/>employment, without friends, many not speaking our <lb/>language, without any dependence for food, or rainment[?], <lb/>or fireside." In Boston and Philadelphia, also, nearly <lb/>one-half of the inmates of the almshouses were foreign<lb break="no"/>ers.</p>

               <lb/>Berlin, 5th instant, refers to the late arrests in Posen, <lb/>and accuses the Catholic clergy of stimulating their <lb/>flocks to revolt. The Prussian Government had, in <lb/>consequence, increased its exertions to conciliate the <lb/>Court of Rome, in hopes that its influence would be <lb/>exercised over the clergy, and induce them to return <lb/>to their allegiance. On the other hand, the sect of <lb/>Separatists, who had resolved to emigrate from Austria <lb/>to Australia, because of the interference of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment with their religious belief, amounted to 40,000 <lb/>souls. It was said they would be joined by a great <lb/>number of the inhabitants of Pomerania.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Commission of the General Assembly</hi>
            </p>
                <p>On Wednesday, the Commission of Assembly met in <lb/>the Tolbooth Church–Dr Muir, Moderator, in the <lb/>chair.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">The Presbyterian Church in New South Wales. </hi>
               <lb/>–The Moderator recalled to the notice of the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion, that on a former meeting, they had directed him <lb/>to write to Lord Glenelg, Secretary for the Colonies, <lb/>disavowing connection with Dr Lang in New South <lb/>Wales, and blaming his proceedings in that colony, in <lb/>separating himself from the Presbytery there formed in <lb/>connection with the Church of Scotland. Since that <lb/>time he had had a communication from Lord Glenelg, <lb/>which he was sure would be received by the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion with great satisfaction.</p>
                <p>The communication from Lord Glenelg was then <lb/>read. It consisted of a copy of the despatch transmit<lb break="no"/>ted to the Governor of New South Wales, approving <lb/>of his conduct in withholding the salaries of the Pres<lb break="no"/>byterian laymen who had not submitted themselves to <lb/>the authority of the Presbytery in connection with the <lb/>Church of Scotland, and further directing that Dr <lb/>Lang's salary should be discontinued. His lordship <lb/>explained, that in doing this the Government had no <lb/>wish to constitute themselves judges in any ecclesias<lb break="no"/>tical disputes ; but as the salaries awarded to these <lb/>gentlemen had been given on the faith that they were <lb/>to remain in connection with the Church of Scotland, <lb/>they could not be continued so long as they defied her <lb/>authority.</p>
                <p>On the motion of Mr Dunlop, the Commission una<lb break="no"/>nimously expressed their satisfaction with the prompti<lb break="no"/>tude and decision which the Government had shown <lb/>in the matter ; and directed the Moderator to commu<lb break="no"/>nicate their minute to Lord Glenelg. It was also agreed <lb/>to re-appoint the Committee to watch over the farther <lb/>proceedings, especially as it was understoof that Dr <lb/>Lang was now on his way to this country.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Case of Small Isles.</hi> –The Commission, then pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded to take up the case of Small Isles, which, it will <lb/>be recollected, arose out of the Rev. Mr M'Lean hav<lb break="no"/>ing, as was alleged, appeared in the lobby of the As<lb break="no"/>sembly House, while that Court was sitting in May last, <lb/>in a state of intoxication. The case occupied the Court <lb/>a considerable part of the day; and at the evening <lb/>sederunt the following motion, by Dr Gardner, was una<lb break="no"/>nimously agreed to–That the Commission having con<lb break="no"/>sidered the evidence on the record, find, that in as far <lb/>as that evidence is hearsay, it is inadmissable; but find <lb/>it proved that on the afternoon of Friday the 25th of <lb/>May last, Mr M'Lean was seen in a state of intoxication <lb/>in the vestibule of the General Assembly, attempting <lb/>to force his way into it; that it is proved he was on two <lb/>other occasions during the sitting of last Assembly in a <lb/>state of intoxication; and, therefore, they find that he <lb/>ought to be deposed from the office of the holy minis<lb break="no"/>try, and direct the Moderator accordingly to pronounce <lb/>the sentence of deposition, directing the Clerk to trans<lb break="no"/>mit an extract of the sentence to the Presbytery of <lb/>Skye, and them to declare the parish of Small Isles <lb/>vacant.–The Moderator pronounced from the chair <lb/>the sentence os deposition.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Case of Lethendy.</hi> –In the course of the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings during the early sederunt of the Commission, the <lb/>Procurator rose and said, he might take the present <lb/>opportunity of stating to the Commission, that within <lb/>the last three or four days a petition and complaint had <lb/>been given in to the Court of Session, and appointed to <lb/>be served, at the instance of Mr Clark, presentee to the <lb/>parish of Lethendy, against the Presbytery of Dunkeld, <lb/>and Mr Kessen, whom that Presbytery had lately in<lb break="no"/>ducted into that charge, in despite of interdicts issued <lb/>by the Court of Session. He mentioned the fact to that <lb/>Commission, presuming that they would authorize him <lb/>to defend the Presbytery, who had acted under autho<lb break="no"/>rity of the Commission itself.</p>
                <p>Mr Buchanan of Glasgow, after some remarks in <lb/>commendation of the firmness of the Presbytery in carry<lb break="no"/>ing through the settlement amidst many difficulties, <lb/>moved that "The Commission sanction the Procu<lb break="no"/>rator's defending the Presbytery in the trying <lb/>circumstances in which they are placed, and resolve <lb/>that they will to the utmost of their power encourage <lb/>and support them under whatsoever difficulties they <lb/>may be subjected by their execution of the sentence <lb/>of the Commission ; and that the thanks of the Com<lb break="no"/>mission be given to the Presbytery for the decision and <lb/>temperate firmness with which they have practically <lb/>maintained the rightful authority and jurisdiction of <lb/>the Church."</p>
                <p>Dr Bryce said, he was quite unprepared for any mo<lb break="no"/>tion on this subject; but with the views which he enter<lb break="no"/>tained in regard to this case, it was impossible he could <lb/>concur in the motion proposed, and he must therefore <lb/>dissent from it.</p>
                <p>Mr James Bridges expressed great indignation against <lb/>Mr Clark for thus bidding defiance to the authority of <lb/>the Church Courts, and he proposed, that for thus <lb/>trampling on the rights and dignity of the Church, Mr <lb/>Clark should be forthwith called before the Commission <lb/>for an exemplary punishment.–Mr Dunlop suggested, <lb/>that although he concurred in feeling with Mr Bridges, <lb/>it would be premature at present to take any steps <lb/>against Mr Clark, inasmuch as there was no official <lb/>communication on the subject from the Presbytery of <lb/>Dunkeld.</p>
                <p>Mr Makgill recommended to Mr Bridges, for this <lb/>reason, not to press his motion, declaring, that as at <lb/>this time 200 years ago eight Bishops had been de<lb break="no"/>posed, he trusted the time was not far distant when Mr <lb/>Clark would receive a similar reward for his misconduct; <lb/>and Mr M. said emphatically, that whatever the Pres<lb break="no"/>bytery of Dunkeld might suffer for upholding the inde<lb break="no"/>pendence of the Church, he, as a member of Commis<lb break="no"/>sion, by whose orders they had acted, would be proud to <lb/>bear his share.</p>
                <p>Mr bridges then intimated, that he would waive <lb/>pressing his motion, and Mr Buchanan's was adopted, <lb/>Dr Bryce and Mr W. Malcolm intimating their dissent, <lb/>on the ground that it was incompetent and inexpedient <lb/>for the Commission to adopt such a resolution.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Commemoration of the Second Centenary of the </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Celebrated Assembly at Glasgow.</hi> –In the course <lb/>of the day, the Moderator suggested, that as this was <lb/>the second centenary of the great Assembly at Glas<lb break="no"/>gow, which might be considered as the founder, not <lb/>only of their ecclesiastical but of their civil liverties, <lb/>a meeting should be held, exclusively devoted to prayer <lb/>and thanksgiving to Almighty God for the benefits con<lb break="no"/>ferred on their Zion.</p>
                <p>At seven o'clock accordingly, several of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers, and a considerable number of people assembled, <lb/>when an hour was spent in devotional exercises, which <lb/>were conducted by Drs Muir, Lee, and Dickson, in <lb/>succession.</p>
                <p>The Commission adjourned to the second Tuesday in <lb/>February next.</p>
