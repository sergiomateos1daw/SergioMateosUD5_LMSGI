                <p>" <hi rend="smallcaps">Quebec</hi>, March 23, 1810.–A number of <lb/>leading characters among the Canadians, who were <lb/>Members of the House of Assembly (twice dissol<lb break="no"/>ved for improper conduct) and the proprietor of a <lb/>French paper, called <hi rend="italic">La Canadien</hi>, have been arrest<lb break="no"/>ed and thrown into jail, upon a charge of treason<lb break="no"/>able and seditious practises ; the printing press, types, <lb/>&amp;c. also taken possession of. This vigorous mea<lb break="no"/>sure of Sir James Craig, has astonished the Cana<lb break="no"/>dians not a little, but the consequences will be no <lb/>doubt beneficial to the country, as it has crushed a <lb/>faction which has for some years been gaining <lb/>strength, and acquiring dangerous influence over the <lb/>minds of the inhabitants, who are without education, <lb/>and ignorant, of course, in the extreme ; therefore <lb/>easily misled by demagogues among their country<lb break="no"/>men, who seize every opportunity of stirring up all <lb/>those prejudices which the people of this country <lb/>naturally have against the British : for, having been <lb/>allowed to preserve their language, they are nearly <lb/>as much Frenchmen now as they were at the con<lb break="no"/>quest."</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Quebec</hi>, March 22.–On Sunday afternoon, the <lb/>printer of the <hi rend="italic">Canadien</hi>, Mr Charles Lafrancois <lb/>was arrested and committed to jail, under a warrant <lb/>from the Executive Council, on a charge of treason<lb break="no"/>able practises. On Monday evening, Dr Blanchet <lb/>and Mr Bedard, and last evening Mr T. Taschereau, <lb/>were also arrested, and committed by the same au<lb break="no"/>thority on the same charges.</p>
                <p>The Commander in Chief in Scotland gave an e<lb break="no"/>legant dinner, at head-quarters, on the 4th curt. to <lb/>celebrate the King's birthday-day–at which several of <lb/>the Nobility and Gentry, Generals, and Field-Offi<lb break="no"/>cers of the army, were present.</p>
                <p>Among the other accidents that occurred on the <lb/>King's birth-day, from the imprudent use of gun<lb break="no"/>powder, is the death of girl in Richmond Street.– <lb/>Her clothes were set fire by a squib, and, al<lb break="no"/>though immediately taken to the Infirmary, was so <lb/>severely burnt, that she died before morning.</p>
                <p>A very melancholy accident happened at a place <lb/>called the Pease, Berwickshire. As one of the bag<lb break="no"/>gage carts of the Forfarshire militia was stopping <lb/>there, a fine boy about eight years of age, belonging <lb/>to Serjeant-Major Nicol, got out of the cart, and <lb/>was climbing on the wheel, when the horses sudden<lb break="no"/>going off, threw him on the ground, and the <lb/>wheel passing over his body, crushed him to death. <lb/>The unfortunate mother was upon the cart when this <lb/>unhappy accident happened.</p>
                <p>On Thursday night, a spirit shop in Gibson-street, <lb/>Glasgow, was broken into and about five pounds <lb/>in silver, a seven shilling piece, about eight shillings <lb/>of copper, a counterfeit half-guinea, and a poc<lb break="no"/>ket-book containing some bills and papers carried ; <lb/>some partial payments are marked on the bills. The <lb/>villains appear to have entered the shop by forcing <lb/>up the window shutter with an iron bar, and then <lb/>breaking a pane of glass, by which they got the iron <lb/>bolts and the window opened.</p>
                <p>On Saturday last, a porter was killed in the hold <lb/>of a vessel in Dundee harbour. He was engaged <lb/>unloading coals ; and the rope by which the iron pul<lb break="no"/>ly was supported, giving way, the measure fell down <lb/>upon him, and killed him instantly.</p>
                <p>A few days ago, a mason, of the name of Steven<lb break="no"/>son, was killed by the blowing up of some stones, at <lb/>Templeton, in the parish of Auchterhouse. The <lb/>match unfortunately communicated too early to the <lb/>powder, and the explosion took place before he <lb/>could get out of the way. He has left a wife and <lb/>two children to lament his loss.</p>

               <pb n="2"/>CORONER'S INQUEST.–An inquest was held yesterday <lb/>evening, before Anthony Gell, Esq. at the Nag's Head, <lb/>in Grange-court, Leicester-square, on the body of Ann <lb/>Paris, an unfortunate young creature, of interesting ap<lb break="no"/>pearance, not more than 17 years of age, who, it ap<lb break="no"/>peared, had been reduced by some unknown melancholy <lb/>circumstance, to the most forlorn and destitute situations. <lb/>It was stated in evidence, that she had taken her lodg<lb break="no"/>ings only seven weeks, and that during that time she <lb/>had evinced the most wretched state of mind, and, on <lb/>Thursday morning, urged on by the poignancy of her <lb/>feelings, or derangement of her intellect, she swal<lb break="no"/>lowed a considerable quantity of laudanum. On the vio<lb break="no"/>lence of her death-pangs coming on, medical air was <lb/>sent for, but too late to be of any assistance, and in a <lb/>short time she expired.–The Coroner's Jury returned a <lb/>verdict of <hi rend="italic">Lunacy</hi>.</p>
                <p>The history of this poor young creature is at once ro<lb break="no"/>mantic and interesting. She is the daughter of a Mon<lb break="no"/>sieur Paris, who was well known in the commencement <lb/>of the Revolution, and in which he suffered. Madame <lb/>Paris, with her infant daughter, took refuge in this <lb/>country; and in the ruin of her fortune, became a <lb/>governess in a noble family in Scotland. After this she <lb/>had a house in the New-road; and, about two years ago, <lb/>died of the rupture of a blood vessel. Her daughter had <lb/>been placed at an eminent boarding-school near one of <lb/>the new squares; and on the death of her mother was <lb/>placed under the guardianship of a Member of Par<lb break="no"/>liament, who, with the most liberal and benevolent at<lb break="no"/>tention to her destitute situation, resolved to complete <lb/>her education; and she had every master of eminence in <lb/>all the elegant arts. She spoke French and Italian; <lb/>touched the piano with great execution; sung with taste; <lb/>and had read beyond her years.</p>
                <p>About six or eight months ago she was met in the <lb/>square, when walking with the other young ladies, by a <lb/>young man in the dress of a midshipman, who followed <lb/>her to the door, and who wrote to her under the name <lb/>of Jones. A correspondence took place. Her imagin<lb break="no"/>ation was fired; and she eloped with him under a pro<lb break="no"/>mise of marriage. His address was found in her box, <lb/>and they were traced by her guardian, and separated. <lb/>Jones declared that she was virtuous, and his intentions <lb/>were honourable, and as a proof of it he was ready to <lb/>marry her with her guardian's consent. In effect they <lb/>were married and she was completely undone. In <lb/>about a fortnight or three weeks Jones threw off his <lb/>disguise, and fairly told her his real character– that he <lb/>was no sailor, but lived by his shifts; that he had mar<lb break="no"/>ried her only for the sum her protector had paid him, <lb/>and that she must provide for herself. She was aban<lb break="no"/>doned; and the shock had such an effect on her imagin<lb break="no"/>ation, that she has ever since shewed signs of a disordered <lb/>intellect. With a heart that shrunk from vice, she was <lb/>flung on the world without a friend or a home; and in <lb/>this deplorable state she became the victim of necessity.</p>
                <p>About three weeks ago, she saw an officer, who is dis<lb break="no"/>tinguished for his gallantries, and who by his address <lb/>and attentions so won upon her affections, that she could <lb/>neither speak nor think of any other object. This fatal <lb/>attachment absorbed her whole soul. They entered into <lb/>engagements to live and die only for one another; and <lb/>in the frenzy of this passion, or under the idea that she <lb/>could not be his, and his alone, she took the desperate <lb/>resolution of dying for him. She had prepared three <lb/>phials of opium, who of which she swallowed, and she <lb/>died with a spirit of heroism; for no persuasion nor force <lb/>could make her, when seized with the nausea of the <lb/>poison, take any antidote to the draughts. She would <lb/>not suffer the medical men to approach her–and though <lb/>after stupefaction came on, they administered every <lb/>known medicine, they all failed of effect.</p>

               <pb n="15"/> On Friday, an Inquest was held at the Nag's Head, Leices<lb break="no"/>ter-fields, on the body of Madamoiselle Ann Paris, then lying <lb/>dead at No. 4, St. Martin's-street, Leicester-fields.– <hi rend="italic">Sarah Upton</hi>  deposed, that she is housemaid to the place. She had <lb/>frequently observed that the unfortunate young lady appeared <lb/>to be rather flighty and tiresome in her manner, such as ringing <lb/>the bell violently, giving orders, and almost immediately after <lb/>giving counter-orders; at other times she would ring with equal <lb/>violence, and when any of the servants inquired what she want<lb break="no"/>ed, she would tell them she wanted nothing. At one time the <lb/>deceased gave the witness a shilling to buy her some laudanum. <lb/>The witness said, "Good God, Miss, you surely must be mad <lb/>to think of such a thing; besides you know it is contrary to <lb/>law, and I can't procure it." She then set down and wept bit<lb break="no"/>terly; she said she could get it in a minute; she had been used <lb/>to take it for a pain in her bowels.–The witness replied, <lb/>"Very well, miss, you may kill yourself, but I shall not give <lb/> 
               <cb/> my assistance to the deed." On Wednesday, she went out at <lb/>two, and returned at half after six o'clock. She then said, that <lb/>she had given a coachman a 1 <hi rend="itali">l</hi>. note at Brompton, she had to <lb/>pay the man only 2s. but she would not wait for her change, as <lb/>she thought it was much better to lose money than time. She <lb/> went out about a quarter of an hour, after the time of her com<lb break="no"/>ing home, and returned again at eight o'clock, having her bon<lb break="no"/>net all bedizened with artificial flowers. She got a candle, <lb/>went up to her own apartments, and returned in about seven <lb/> minutes time; she refused to take tea with two ladies that were <lb/>in the parlour at the time; she sat down at first in an extreme<lb break="no"/>ly pensive manner, then, in the course of a minute or two, with <lb/>the utmost wildness in her countenance, she exclaimed, "Oh, I <lb/>shall never see him again! I have done the job–I have taken <lb/>good care that the laudanum I took should do the business." <lb/>The witness was instantly alarmed, knowing that the deceased <lb/>had ordered her to get some laudanum for her before then. She <lb/>ran up stairs in the utmost consternation, and saw the phials in <lb/>the lady's chamber. Upon her return, she endeavoured to get <lb/>some explanation for the poor young lady as to what induced <lb/>her to commit such an act of desperation, but in vain–she look<lb break="no"/>ed wild, and continued raving for some time, and then fell into <lb/>a state of stupefaction. Medical assistance was sent for; three <lb/>Professional Gentlemen attended, but they could afford her no <lb/>relief. She died before day light on Thursday morning. The <lb/>witness knew nothing of any particular visitor to the deceased; neither had she the least knowledge of any of her relations or <lb/>friends. The Jury returned the verdict– <hi rend="italic">Insanity</hi>.</p>
                <p>The history of this poor young creature is at once romantic <lb/>and interesting. She is the daughter of a Monsieur Paris, who <lb/>was well known in the commencement of the Revolution, and <lb/>in which he suffered.–Madame Paris, with her infant daugh<lb break="no"/>ter, took refuge in this country, and in the ruin of her fortune, <lb/>became a governess in a noble family in Scotland. After this, <lb/>she had a house in the New Road; and about two years ago <lb/>died of the rupture of a blood vessel. Her daughter had been <lb/>placed at an eminent boarding-school near one of the new <lb/>squares; and on the death of her mother was placed under the <lb/>guardianship of a Member of Parliament, who, with the most <lb/>liberal and benevolent attention to her destitute situation, re<lb break="no"/>solved to complete her education, and she had every master of <lb/>eminence in all the elegant arts. She spoke French and Ita<lb break="no"/>lian; touched the piano with great execution; sung with taste; <lb/>and had read beyond her years.–About six or eight months <lb/>ago, she was met in the square, when walking with the other <lb/>young ladies, by a young man in the dress of a Midshipman, <lb/>who followed her to the door, and who wrote to her under the <lb/>name of Jones. A correspondence took place; her imagina<lb break="no"/>tion was fired, and she eloped with him under a promise of <lb/>marriage. His address was found in her box, and they were <lb/>traced by her guardian, and separated. Jones declared that <lb/>she was virtuous, and his intentions were honourable, and as a <lb/>proof of it he was ready to marry her with her guardian's con<lb break="no"/>sent. In effect, they were married, and she was undone. In <lb/>about a fortnight or three weeks Jones threw off his disguise, <lb/>and fairly told her his real character,– that he was no sailor, <lb/>but lived by his shifts; that he had married her only for the <lb/>sum her protector had paid him, and that she must provide for <lb/>herself. She was abandoned; and the shock had such an <lb/>effect on her imagination, that she has ever since shewed signs <lb/>of A DISORDERED INTELLECT! With a heart that shrunk <lb/>from vice, she was flung on the world without a friend, or a <lb/>home; and in this deplorable state she became the victim of <lb/>necessity. About three weeks ago she saw an officer, who is <lb/>distinguished for his gallantries, and who by his address and <lb/>attentions so won upon her affections, that she could neither <lb/>speak nor think of any other object. This fatal attachment <lb/>absorbed her whole soul. They entered into engagements to <lb/>live and die only for one another; and in the frenzy of this <lb/>passion, or under the idea that she could not be his, and his <lb/>alone, she took the desperate resolution of dying for him. She <lb/>had prepared three phials of opium, who of which she swal<lb break="no"/>lowed; and she died with a spirit of heroism; for no per<lb break="no"/>suasion nor force could make her, when seized with the nausea <lb/>
               <pb n="16"/> of the poison, take any antidote to the draughts. She would <lb/>not suffer the medical men to approach her–and though after <lb/>stupefaction came on they administered every known medicine, <lb/>they all failed of effect. <lb/>

               <hi rend="small-caps">Coroner's Inquest</hi>.–At half past two o'clock <lb/>yesterday, an Inquest was held at the Nag's Head, <lb/>Orange-court, Leicester-fields, before Anthony Gell, <lb/>Esq. Coroner for Westminster, on the body of Mada<lb break="no"/>moiselle Ann Paris, then lying dead at No. 4, St. Mar<lb break="no"/>tin's-street, Leicester-fields.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Sarah Upton</hi>  deposed, that she is housemaid to the <lb/>place; that the deceased had lodged about seven <lb/>weeks in the house, during which time the witness at<lb break="no"/>tended more particularly than any other servant about the <lb/>person of the deceased. She had frequently observed <lb/>that the unfortunate young lady appeared to be rather <lb/>flighty and tiresome in her manner, such as ringing the <lb/>bell violently, giving orders and almost immediately <lb/>after giving counter-orders; at other times she would <lb/>ring with equal violence, and when any of the servants <lb/>inquired what she wanted, she would tell them she <lb/>wanted nothing. She was also extremely incoherent in <lb/>her discourse, rambling from one subject to another <lb/>with the utmost rapidity, and without there being the <lb/>least connection between each.</p>
                <p>In answer to a question from one of the Jurymen, the <lb/>witness said that the deceased was by no means in the <lb/>habit of drinking, but that on the day on which the un<lb break="no"/>fortunate affair took place, she thought the deceased <lb/>appeared wild, as if she had been drinking.</p>
                <p>At one time the deceased told the witness that some one <lb/>had said she was mad; another time she gave the wit<lb break="no"/>ness a shilling to buy her some laudanum. The witness <lb/>said " Good God, Miss, you surely must be mad to <lb/>think of such a thing; besides you know it is contrary <lb/>to law, and I can't procure it." She then set down <lb/>and wept bitterly; she said she could get it in a minute; <lb/>she had been used to take it for a pain in her bowels.– <lb/>The witness replied, "Very well, Miss, you may kill <lb/>yourself, but I shall not give my assistance to the deed." <lb/>At other times, the poor young lady would be to all <lb/>appearances in excellent spirits, when all of a sudden <lb/>she would burst into tears, without any thing being <lb/>said or done at the time to occasion it. She would <lb/>sometimes fiddle with her clothes, like a person who <lb/>was beside herself; she would collect a few flowers and <lb/>deck her hair with them, and a thousand other little <lb/>tricks that appeared to to the witness to be the most mani<lb break="no"/>fest proofs of a deranged intellect. On Wednesday, she <lb/>went out at two, and returned at half after six o'clock. <lb/>She then said, that she had given a coachman a 1l. <lb/>note at Brompton, she had to pay the man only 2s. <lb/>but she would not wait for her change, as she thought <lb/>it was much better to lose money than time. She <lb/>went out about a quarter of an hour, after the <lb/>time of her coming home, and returned again <lb/>at eight o'clock, having her bonnet all bedizened <lb/>with artificial flowers. She got a candle, went up <lb/>to her own apartments, and returned in about seven <lb/>minutes time; she refused to take tea with two <lb/>ladies that were in the parlour at the time; she sat down <lb/>at first in an extremely pensive manner, then, in the <lb/>course of a minute or two, with the utmost wildness in <lb/>her countenance, she exclaimed, "Oh, I shall never <lb/>see him again! I have done the job–I have taken <lb/>good care that the laudanum I took should do the busi<lb break="no"/>ness." The witness was instantly alarmed, knowing <lb/>that the deceased had ordered her to get some laudanum <lb/>for her before then. She ran up stairs in the utmost <lb/>consternation, and saw the phials in the lady's chamber. <lb/>Upon her return she endeavoured to get some explana<lb break="no"/>tion for the poor young lady as to what induced her to <lb/>commit such an act of desperation, but in vain–she <lb/>looked wild, and continued raving for some time, and <lb/>then fell into a state of stupefaction. Immediately <lb/>on the unfortunate occurrence being known, medi<lb break="no"/>cal assistance was sent for; three Professional Gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen attended, but they could afford her no relief. <lb/>She died before daylight on Thursday morning. The <lb/>witness knew nothing of any particular visitor to the de<lb break="no"/>ceased; neither had she the least knowledge of <lb/>any of her relations or friends.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Mr. Emanuel Gristock</hi>, of Wardour-street, surgeon, <lb/>stated, that between ten and eleven on Wednesday <lb/>night he saw the deceased; she refused all medicine that <lb/>was offered her for the purpose of expelling the poison; <lb/>with some difficulty, however, the witness forced part of <lb/>an emetic down her throat; she said she new she had <lb/>done wrong; and in disjointed sentences and in broken <lb/>accents raved something about her loving a young man. <lb/>Upon examining her apartment the witness found one <lb/>small bottle full of laudanum, and two others empty, <lb/>which evidently had contained the same sort of poison<lb break="no"/>ous liquid; their contents must have been between two <lb/>and three ounces. He left the patient at twelve, being <lb/>under the necessity of attending another at Knights - <lb/>bridge.</p>
                <p>Mr. <hi rend="italic">James Wilkes</hi>, of the Haymarket, surgeon, saw <lb/>the deceased at half after two on Thursday morning; <lb/>she was then in a state of actual torpor, the nervous <lb/>system appeared to be totally deranged, and she was <lb/>incapable of making the least exertion with her body <lb/>or limbs. She appeared to be past all hopes of recovery <lb/>from the moment the witness saw her. However, hav<lb break="no"/>ing been previously apprised of the situations of the pa<lb break="no"/>tient, the witness had taken a bottle containing an eme<lb break="no"/>tic in his pocket. With the utmost difficulty he forced <lb/>part of it down her throat, but it had no effect–the <lb/>patient continued in the same torpid state until five <lb/>o'clock in the morning, when she expired. Dr. Hoop<lb break="no"/>er prescribed some other medicines, which we at<lb break="no"/>tempted to be administered, ut in vain; the patient <lb/>was totally incapable of swallowing them.</p>
                <p>A jeweller had known the young lady for a consi<lb break="no"/>derable length of time; he had served her with a va<lb break="no"/>riety of trinkets in his line of business, and was in the <lb/>constant habit of attending her two or three times a <lb/>week. He had frequently observed the poor unfortu<lb break="no"/>nate young lady act with the utmost inconsistency and <lb/>wildness; he had repeatedly known her to burst into <lb/>tears in the midst of apparent merriment; he had known <lb/>her to order clothes to dress for going out, then turn <lb/>short and saw she would not go out that day; and he <lb/>had known her once ,after sitting for some time in the <lb/>most pensive mode imaginable, start up suddenly, and <lb/>exclaim, "No, I will not stand this." She was be<lb break="no"/>tween 17 and 18 years of age; he understood that she <lb/>was born in France, but she spoke English as well as <lb/>French. The day before the occurance of the me<lb break="no"/>lancholy transaction, which was the subject of the prev<lb break="no"/>sent consideration of the Jury, she had, with frenzy de<lb break="no"/>picted in her countenance, exclaimed, "Well, if my <lb/>wishes are not fulfilled, I shall hang or drown myself." <lb/>The witness had not the least knowledge of what she <lb/>alluded to neither had he ever heard that she had any <lb/>relations in London. He was most decidedly of opi<lb break="no"/>nion that she was deranged in her intellects.</p>
                <p>The Jury without a moment's hesitation, returned <lb/>their verdict– <hi rend="italic">Insanity</hi>.</p>
                <p>The history of this poor young creature is at once <lb/>romantic and interesting. She is the daughter of a <lb/>Monsieur Paris, who was well known in the commence<lb break="no"/>ment of the Revolution, and in which he suffered.– <lb/>Madame Paris, with her infant daughter, took refuge <lb/>
