               <pb n="3"/> CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.</p>
                <p>The following account of the inhabitants of this <lb/>settlement is given by a late traveller.</p>
                <p>The education of youth has hitherto been very <lb/>much neglected: the government never hit upon any <lb/>successful plan for the establishment of public schools; <cb/>and the individual had no other ambition but that of <lb/>qualifying his sons, by writing and accounts, to be<lb break="no"/>come servants of the Company. This body of mer<lb break="no"/>chants had a number of persons in their employ, <lb/>who were very ill paid. Their salaries, indeed, were <lb/>sufficient to afford them a bare subsistence ; but it ta<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>citly allowed them to negotiate for themselves: the <lb/>consequence of such a conduct was, that each be<lb break="no"/>came a kind of petty dealer. Each had his little pri<lb break="no"/>vate shop in some corner of his house. The most pal<lb break="no"/>try articles were in the list of their commodities for <lb/>sale ; and those who ranked high in government, <lb/>and assumed a string of full-founding epithets to <lb/>their names, felt no sore of indignity in retailing the <lb/>produce of their gardens ; not indeed, avowedly, but <lb/>through the medium of their slaves. In fact, the minds <lb/>of every class, the Governor, the Clergy, the F[?]l, <lb/>and the Secretary of the Court of Justice excepted, <lb/>were wholly bent on trade. <hi rend="italic">Knopman</hi>, or merchant, <lb/>was a title that conferred rank at the Cape, to which <lb/>the military even aspired. On this subject the ideas <lb/>of the Dutch differ widely from those of the Chi<lb break="no"/>nese, who have degraded the merchant into the <lb/>very lowest order of their society.</p>
                <p>That portion of the day, not employed in the <lb/>concerns of trade, is usually devoted to the grati<lb break="no"/>fication of the sensual appetite. Few have any taste <lb/>for reading, and none for the cultivation of the fine <lb/>arts.–They have no kind of public amusements, <lb/>except occasional balls ; nor is there much social <lb/>intercourse but by family parties; which usually <lb/>consist of card playing or dancing. Money-mat<lb break="no"/>ters and merchandize engross their whole conver<lb break="no"/>sation : yet none are opulent, though many in easy <lb/>circumstances. There are no beggars in the whole <lb/>colony, and but a few who are objects of public cha<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>rity. The subsistence for these is derived from the <lb/>interest of a fund established out of the church su<lb break="no"/>perfluities, from alms, donations, and collections, <lb/>made after divine service, and not from any tax laid <lb/>upon the public. Except, indeed, a few colonial <lb/>assessments for the repairs of the streets and public <lb/>works, the inhabitants of the Cape have little <lb/>drawback on their profits, on the produce of their <lb/>labour.</p>
                <p>It has been the remark of most travellers, that <lb/>the ladies of the Cape are pretty, lively, and good <lb/>humoured ; possessing little of that phlegmatic tem<lb break="no"/>per which is a principal trait in the national charac<lb break="no"/>ter of the Dutch. The difference in the manners <lb/>and appearance of the young men and the young <lb/>women, in the same family, is inconceivably great. <lb/>The former are clumsy in their shape, awkward in <lb/>in their carriage, and of an unsocial disposition; <lb/>whilst the latter are generally of a small, delicate <lb/>form, below the middle size, of easy and unaffected <lb/>manners, well dressed, and fond of social intercourse; <lb/>an indulgence in which they are seldom restrained <lb/>by their parents, and which they as seldom turn to <lb/>abuse. They are here indeed less dependent on, <lb/>and less subject to, the caprice of parents than else <lb/>where. Primogeniture entitles to no advantage; <lb/>but all the children, male and female, share alike <lb/>in the family property. No parent can disinherit a <lb/>child without assigning, on proof, on at least of <lb/>the fourteen reasons enumerated in the Justinian <lb/>Code.</p>
                <p>By the law of the colony, a community of all <lb/>property, both real and personal, is supposed to take <lb/>place on the marriage of two person unless the <lb/>contrary should be particularly provided against by <lb/>solemn contract made before marriage. Where no <lb/>such contract exists, the children, on the death of <lb/>either parent, are entitled to that half of the joint <lb/>property, which was supposed to belong to the de<lb break="no"/>ceased, and which cannot be withheld on applica<lb break="no"/>tion after they are come of age.</p>
                <p>It is but justice to the young females of the Cape <lb/>to r emark, that many of them have profited much <lb/>more than could be expected from the limited <lb/>means of education that the place affords. In the <lb/>better families, most of them are taught music, and <lb/>some have acquired a tolerable degree of execution. <lb/>Many understand the French language, and some <lb/>have made great proficiency in the English. They <pb n="4"/> are expert at the needle, and all kinds of lace, knot<lb break="no"/>ting, and tambour work, and in general make up <lb/>their own dresses, following the prevailing fashion <lb/>of England brought from time to time by the female <lb/>passengers bound to India, from whom they may <lb/>be said to <lb/>
               <hi rend="center">"Catch the manners living as they rise"</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Neither are the other sex, while boys, deficient <lb/>in vivacity or talent ; but, for want of the means of <lb/>a proper education, to open their minds, and excite <lb/>in them a desire of knowledge, they soon degene<lb break="no"/>rate into the common routine of eating, smoaking [sic], <lb/>and sleeping. Few of the male inhabitants associate <lb/>with the English, except such as hold employments <lb/>under the Government. This backwardness may <lb/>be said to be owing in part to the different habits of <lb/>the two nations, and partly, perhaps, to the reluc<lb break="no"/>tance that a vanquished people must always feel in <lb/>mixing with their conquerors.</p>

                <p>Our humanity was deeply affected by the dread<lb break="no"/>ful carnage made by the Indians. You may be <lb/>assured that the number of Indians did not exceed <lb/>1000, and that nothing saved General St. Clair, <lb/>and the remainder of his army, but the great quan<lb break="no"/>tity of plunder he left to the Indians; they were <lb/>composed of various tribes, and three-fourths of <lb/>of them remained in the camp to plunder it, and to <lb/>take scalps, the trophies of their victory; and he <lb/>that got most when he returned to his nation, ac<lb break="no"/>quired the greatest share of glory; hence only a<lb break="no"/>bout 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is un<lb break="no"/>der 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they <lb/>have obtained at so easy a purchase, and the riches <lb/>they obtained by the plunder, and the provisions <lb/>they found, will make them a more terrible foe <lb/>than ever they have been; they boast of taking an <lb/>amazing quantity of powder and arms, which they <lb/>wanted; many of them were only armed with <lb/>spears and hatchets, and I have no doubt but if a<lb break="no"/>nother expedition should be set on foot, that they <lb/>will be met by three times the number of Indians. <lb/>The indian tribes of nations who live many hun<lb break="no"/>dred miles back have all entered into an association, <lb/>and made the present war a common concern, they <lb/>to oppose what they call the common enemy. The <lb/>warriors of the different tribes so united are not <lb/>less than 15 or 20,000; numbers of the chiefs of <lb/>ten or twelve numerous nations were here last sum<lb break="no"/>mer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make <lb/>peace, and offered his mediations; he told them he <lb/>was at peace with the United States, and could <lb/>give them no assistance. Their answer was, that <lb/>the enemy was in their country, and would not <lb/>make peace with them, but on term dishonourable, <lb/>and at the expense of their country, and that they <lb/>had determined to die before they would accept of <lb/>such terms. They felt much dissatisfied with the <lb/>answer they received, and departed with a full de<lb break="no"/>termination to defend their country with the last <lb/>of their blood.</p>
                <p>You may depend on it, that many years will e<lb break="no"/>lapse, and many thousand men be expended before <lb/>the United States will, by the present measures, <lb/>be able to possess the country in contest; and I <lb/>may also add, that I have great apprehensions, that <cb/>desolation and destruction will be the consequence <lb/>on the frontiers of the Ohio this winter and next <lb/>spring; I would to God some steps might be tak<lb break="no"/>en to prevent them. I have no doubt the coun<lb break="no"/>try might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the <lb/>expence already incurred by the different expedi<lb break="no"/>tions; the attempt to take the country from them <lb/>by force, is founded in unrighteousness, and ought <lb/>to be abandoned; besides, if the American mean <lb/>to have anytrade with them, they are taking steps <lb/>that will prevent it for many years to come. The <lb/>Indians do not easily forget or forgive injuries</p>

                <p>"Last Sunday evening came to this town a <lb/>young man from Cat-fish, which he left about two <lb/>weeks ago, and who gave us the following pleasing <lb/>interesting, and important intelligence, viz, that <lb/>two days before he left Cat-fish, two men arrived <lb/>there from Licking, who informed, that they had <lb/>been out with a body of 1300 volunteers on horse<lb break="no"/>back from Kentucky, under General Scott; that <lb/>they left Licking on the expedition a few days be<lb break="no"/>fore Christmas; that General Scott dispatched <lb/>three spies in advance, who, when they arrived a<lb break="no"/>bout 13 miles beyond the spot where General St. <lb/>Clair was defeated they discovered a large body of <lb/>Indians diverting and enjoying themselves with the <lb/>plunder they had taken, riding the bullocks, dan<lb break="no"/>cing, &amp;c. and appeared to be mostly drunk; that <lb/>on the information being given to General Scott, <lb/>who, with the main body, were a few miles in the <lb/>rear, he divided them into three divisions, advan<lb break="no"/>ced, and fell on the enemy by surprise; that the <lb/>contest was short, but victorious, on the side of the <lb/>volunteers, 700 of the enemy being killed on the <lb/>spot, all the cannon and stores in their possession <lb/>retaken, and the remainder of that savage body put <lb/>to flight; that General Scott, having lost but six <lb/>men, returned to Licking in triumph, with most <lb/>of the cattle, stores, &amp;c. leaving the cannon at <lb/>Fort Jefferson; that General Scott had previous<lb break="no"/>ly gone out with 400 men, but finding his num<lb break="no"/>ber was insufficient, was returning but met a body <lb/>of 900 volunteers when, upon joining him, he im<lb break="no"/>mediately proceeded in prosecution of his original <lb/>design which fortunately proved successful.</p>
                <p>"Our informant further adds, that he saw a <lb/>Kentucky newspaper of the 8th of January, at <lb/>Morgan Town, brought by Major Scott's expedi<lb break="no"/>tion, which corresponded with that given by the <lb/>two men at Cat Fish, and that Gen. Scott brought <lb/>in near 700 scalps."</p>

               <pb n="6"/> By private letters and newspapers lately arrived <lb/>from Philadelphia and New York we have inform<lb break="no"/>mation, that the Indians are carrying on their de<lb break="no"/>predations on the back settlements of the United <lb/>States with great vigour; that an enquiry as to <lb/>the miscarriage of the war had been made by <lb/>Congress, and an army was collected this year; <lb/>that the Americans had some expectations of get<lb break="no"/>ting free of the Indian war by treaties.</p>
                <p>We have advices of Governor Clinton's being <lb/>re-elected Governor of New York state by a ma<lb break="no"/>jority of 180, but the friends of Mr. Tay were <lb/>objecting to the return, as the canvassers had not <lb/>opened the boxes which contained the returns <lb/>from three counties, Otsego, Clinton, and Tioga, <lb/>which if opened they say would have given the <lb/>election to Mr. Tay, the county of Otsego alone <lb/>being 300 majority in favours of Mr. Tay.</p>
                <p>A dreadful storm happened at New York on <lb/>the 1st of July, which continued with so much <lb/>violence, that several vessels were driven from their <lb/>moorings, and a number of boats upset and many <lb/>lives lost.</p>

               <lb/>"On Saturday the 1st of July, I left Tioga point, <lb/>near the middle of the day; about half after one <lb/>o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising from <lb/>the north west, and I had scarcely time to take <lb/>shelter in the house of Obadiah Gore, Esq; at <lb/>Sheshequen, before the storm came on, attended <lb/>with heavy thunder and lightening, and a violent <lb/>gale of wind with rain. The storm continued up<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>wards of half an hour, during which time to see <lb/>the tumbling of timber during the storm, was sur<lb break="no"/>prising. After it abated I continued on my jour<lb break="no"/>ney, but found it very difficult travelling in many <lb/>places, the road being blocked up by the falling <lb/>of timber. I reached Wilksbarree on Wednesday. <lb/>It appears that the storm extended through the <lb/>country, and at the same hour of the day, blew <lb/>more violent in some places than others. At Exe<lb break="no"/>eter, about nine miles from Wilksbarrie, a level <lb/>plain loaded with pitch pine timber, was swept of <lb/>its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile <lb/>in length, and three fourths of a mile wide, being <lb/>either torn up by the roots or twisted off, leaving <lb/>their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high.</p>
                <p>"A number of buildings in different parts of <lb/>the country stript of their roofs, and otherways <lb/>damaged–fences in many place removed, and <lb/>many fields of corn, others grain and flax laid level <lb/>with the earth–cattle killed by the falling of tim<lb break="no"/>ber in every part of the country.</p>
                <p>"A Mr. –Lot, who lived at Mahooper, <lb/>about 35 miles from Wilksbarre, whose family <lb/>consisted of his wife and a number of children– <lb/>he with his wife being absent children seeing them<lb break="no"/>selves in danger in the house, left it at the instant <lb/>a large tree was falling; the tree reached them a <lb/>small distance from the door, and a girl about e<lb break="no"/>leven years of age was crushed to pieces about expir<lb break="no"/>ed instantly. One of the other children had a <lb/>thigh and both arms broke, another badly wound<lb break="no"/>ed in the head–these two it is feared has received <lb/>the fatal blow, two other slightly wounded."</p>

            </p>
                <p>"By accounts from Kentucky we are inform<lb break="no"/>ed, that about the 1st of this month a party of <lb/>Indians appeared near Frankfort, and took a great <lb/>number of horses and negroes. Col. M'Dowell with <lb/>300 men pursued them to the Ohio; but not fal<lb break="no"/>ling in with them he crossed the river, leaving 100 <lb/>men to take care of his horses; after marching <lb/>about 12 or 15 miles, overtook a large party, when <lb/>a severe engagement ensued, but being overpower<lb break="no"/>ed by numbers, was obliged to retreat. He then <lb/>sent for the men left behind, and came up with <lb/>the Indians the next day, and after engaging some <lb/>time, obliged them to make a precipitate retreat. <lb/>Col. M'Dowell took six Indian warriors, two <lb/>Englishmen and a Frenchman from Detroit, and <lb/>all the negroes and horses."</p>

                <p> This city and its vicinity were exceedingly a<lb break="no"/>larmed, last Sabbath, about four o'clock, M.

Unused to such un<lb break="no"/>ruly gusts, the citizens, particularly the fair, were <lb/>thrown into a momentary d<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>ation.

It is said <lb/>that 29 persons lost their lives in this neighbour<lb break="no"/>hood, but we have not been able to ascertain who <lb/>they were for certainty. Report says, that a Mr. <lb/>Wade, his wife and two of their children, his bro<lb break="no"/>ther, and a young man, were all, except the last <lb/>mentioned, drowned from one boat near Yellow <lb/>Hook, a few miles from the city. It is also said, a sloop overset with 16 persons, all but one of <lb/>whom were drowned.</p>
                <p> We learn that the<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> extended to Philadel<lb break="no"/>phia, that ship was driven from her moorings <lb/>there and sunk, and that the road from thence to <lb/>this city, shrewn violent tokens of its visitation.</p>

                <p> On Saturday last, arrived in this city, directly <lb/>from Scotland.–Nesbit, Esq. a gentleman <lb/>who comes warmly recommended by the celebra<lb break="no"/>ted Dr. Robinson, and several other literary cha<lb break="no"/>racters of eminence in that country, as a master of the science of canaling, from several years ex<lb break="no"/>perience both in Holland and in Scotland.</p>

               <lb/>Company, attended by Mr. Nesbit, and a commit<lb break="no"/>ee of Directors, left this city, this morning on a <lb/>tour, to explore the rive from Troy upwards, <lb/>for the purpose of prosecuting the canals with <lb/>spirit the remaining part of the season, and mak<lb break="no"/>ing preparations for its more active prosecution <lb/>in the ensuing year.</p>

                <p> Accounts from South Carolina and Georgia, <lb/>with regard to their prospects of the ensuing crops, <lb/>are very unfavourable, no rains of any consequence <lb/>having fallen in the more eastern disctricts of these <lb/>states since the beginning of April; at which time <lb/>the low country was, in a manner inundaed. The <lb/>Indigo plantations, when the last vessels sailed, <lb/>were almost despaired of, for the next crop, and <lb/>the rice swamps promised not much better.</p>

                <p> We are sorry to learn from New York, that <lb/>spirit of party, respecting a late election of Gover<lb break="no"/>nor" of the State, has arisen to such a height as to <lb/>have occasioned several duels a week. On Thurs<lb break="no"/>day morning last, Colonel W<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> and Mr. Wil<cb break="no"/>cocks, both of New York, had a meeting, and ex<lb break="no"/>changed pistol shot, but their friends in<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> 
               <lb/>prevented any bad consequences.–Colonel Willet <lb/>is friendly to Governor Clinton's election, which Mr. Wilcock opposes.</p>
                <p> We hear from Maryland that a number of gen<lb break="no"/>tlmen of the state are about establishing a society <lb/>in Port-To<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> for the dissemination of useful <lb/>political knowledge, the study of the constitution <lb/>of their country, and the keeping up among the <lb/>people if possible, a knowledge of their rights as <lb/>free citizens of the greatest, and perhaps the only, <lb/>true republic in the universe.</p>

                <p> On Thursday morning, was witnessed a very me<lb break="no"/>lancholy event at Mr. Henry Kizer's power mill, <lb/>in lower Merion township, Montgomery country, <lb/>between the hours of 9 and 10. There was a large <lb/>quantity of powder in the mill, which by accident <lb/>took fire and blew up with a great explosion, <lb/>which was heard at Schuylkill ferry, and was there <lb/>supposed to be an earthquake. Mr Kizer, and <lb/>three others who were in the mill, were blown to pieces; and a Mr. Henry Fraily, a copartner <lb/>of Mr. Kizer, was so wounded that his life is dis<lb break="no"/>pared of. A young woman who happened to be <lb/>near the mill at the time it blew up, had both her <lb/>legs broken, and was otherwise very much injured, <lb/>by one of the rafters which was carried from the <lb/>building in the violence of the explosion.</p>

                <p>"The Indians on Tuesday last killed two men <lb/>and one woman, and stole seven horses between <lb/>the states of Crays Creek and Col. Shepherd's in <lb/>Ohio county, Virginia.–Lieut. Gray and four<lb break="no"/>teen of my men followed them over the Ohio, as <lb/>far as the head of the Soufish, but the Indians being <lb/>on horseback they returned without coming up <lb/>with them. On Saturday last, at Dilly's station <lb/>opposite the mouth of Grave creek, the Indians <lb/>came into one of the houses and killed four and <lb/>wounded one; the number of Indians was suppos <lb/>ed to be twenty. It is thought they will strike <lb/>this quarter. To-morrow morning I intend to <lb/>start with a party to try and fall in with them."</p>
