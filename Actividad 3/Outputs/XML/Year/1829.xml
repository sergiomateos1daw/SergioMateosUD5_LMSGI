               <hi rend="smallcaps">House of Commons.</hi> – <hi rend="smallcaps">June 4</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Sir J. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mackintosh</hi>  presented a petition from Mr <lb/>Charles Buck, complaining that managers of theatres <lb/>were allowed to perform dramatic pieces without the <lb/>knowledge or leave of the writer, and without any pro<lb break="no"/>fit to him. The hon. member said that Lord Byron <lb/>and Mr Millman had made similar complaints, and that <lb/>every person who had given that subject consideration <lb/>admitted that literary property was not sufficiently pro<lb break="no"/>tected in this country, and that the decline of dramatic <lb/>writing was to be attributed to the state of the law.</p>
                <p>Mr G. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lamb</hi>  thought it a very serious grievance that <lb/>if a man wrote a tragedy it might be taken by any ma<lb break="no"/>nager, and performed on the stage, and the writer <lb/>brought to the miserable condition of a <hi rend="italic">damned</hi>  author <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">nolens volenns</hi>. ( <hi rend="italic">A laugh.</hi> ) The decline of dramatic <lb/>writing in this country was to be ascribed to the unpro<lb break="no"/>fitable nature of that description of writing, as compar<lb break="no"/>ed with other branches of literature ; and it would be <lb/>very desirable if a dramatic author had power to sell his <lb/>play like any other description of property, and that no <lb/>manager should perform it without paying the writer, <lb/>which was the system in France.</p>
                <p>The petition was ordered to be printed.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Birmingham Petition.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Brougham</hi>  rose to present a petition from a very <lb/>respectable body. It had been agreed to at a numerous <lb/>meeting of manufacturers, artisans, and other inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants of Birmingham, and was signed by 8000 persons <lb/>without solicitation. they contended that the distress <lb/>which now prevailed, not only had reference to that <lb/>poorer classes of society, but spread itself over the whole <lb/>system of society. This distress the petitioners ascrib<lb break="no"/>ed to the tampering that had taken place with the cur<lb break="no"/>rency. Their opinion was, that too much stress was laid <lb/>upon the panic which had taken place in 1825 ; for, <lb/>though it was true that a great number of failures had <lb/>taken place among the bankers, yet it was no less true, <lb/>that of about 70 bankers who had failed, as many as <lb/>80[?] had subsequently paid 20s in the pound. If such <lb/>were the case he was very glad to hear it. The opinion <lb/>of the petitioners rather was, that the present distress <lb/>arose from the speculations and over-trading which had <lb/>taken place ; and that such might have been the case <lb/>topitally[?], there could be no manner of doubt, That a <lb/>great deal of the distress of the nation had arisen from <lb/>the depreciation of the currency, by which people were <lb/>now paying taxes at a rate that had never been intend<lb break="no"/>ed when they were originally imposed, was extremely <lb/>likely ; but whether it operated to the extent that the <lb/>petitioners described was another question. In the year <lb/>1819 he had been one of those who had resisted the im<lb break="no"/>position of new taxes, because he thought that that was <lb/>the very worst time that Ministers could have chosen <lb/>for such an object. His opinion, however, had been <lb/>over-ruled, and the taxes had been increased. That <lb/>the effect of this must be to cripple the industry of the <lb/>country no man could doubt ; and what he wished was <lb/>to see a remedy for t ; but the misfortune was, that <lb/>after making every possible retrenchment–by reducing <lb/>salaries, and dealing in the best possible way with all <lb/>the payments which the nation had to make–the Dead <lb/>Weight would still remain round the neck of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and press it down to the effectual injury of its best <lb/>interests. How were they to get over the 800 millions <lb/>of debt, and the 30 or 40 millions of interest annually <lb/>payable thereon? In the latter part of the petition he <lb/>entirely agreed, and hoped that every thing would be <cb/>done to give the people as great relief from the pressure <lb/>of the taxes as might be consistent with a due regard to <lb/>the public credit, and the service of the State ; and so <lb/>far from treating this remedy lightly, the more he <lb/>thought that the petitioners were wrong in their obser<lb break="no"/>vations on the tampering of the currency, the more he <lb/>was inclined to listen to that part of the petition which <lb/>appeared to him to be founded on truth.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Bennett</hi>  was of opinion that the forced resto<lb break="no"/>ration of a metallic currency was one of the principal <lb/>causes of the present distress. The taxes were now <lb/>paid in money, and it now required twice the produce <lb/>to pay them which it did before the year 1819. That <lb/>was nothing less than a robbery, but how it was to be <lb/>remedied he really was at a loss to know. He would <lb/>never break faith with the public creditor, and the only <lb/>means to pay off our public debt would be to impose an <lb/>income tax. If the public debt were once removed, <lb/>then free trade could take place in every branch of <lb/>trade, but not till then. Such was the opinion of his <lb/>late friend, Mr Ricardo, and sooner or later he thought <lb/>some such measure would be resorted to.</p>
                <p>Mr Alderman <hi rend="smallcaps">Waitham</hi>  observed that it was <lb/>strange that while the public distress was admitted to <lb/>be extreme, no effort was made to reduce the public ex<lb break="no"/>penditure. He was ready to prove that the export trade <lb/>of the country had fallen off to the amount of from <lb/>nearly nine to thirteen millions, although he knew that <lb/>in saying this he was encountering serious adversaries. <lb/>He did not under-rate our export trade ; it was valuable <lb/>but for a period of thirty-one years it had fallen off at <lb/>the rate of six millions per annum ; and this could be <lb/>shewn from Parliamentary documents. With respect <lb/>to the petition now before the house, he mainly agreed <lb/>with its statements, while at the same time he could <lb/>never consent to any thing like a breach of faith with <lb/>the public creditor.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">W. Whitmore</hi>  heard with astonishment that <lb/>our foreign trade had greatly diminished, the reverse <lb/>being so notoriously the fact. Since 1814 there was <lb/>certainly a fall in the value of our manufactures, but so <lb/>there was in the raw material, and the vast increase of <lb/>machinery should also be taken into account. It was <lb/>said that our exports had declined, but facts would <lb/>prove decidedly the reverse. From 1790 to 1799, the <lb/>exports were L17,000,000 ; from 1800 to 1809, <lb/>L,26,000,000; from 1810 to 1819, L36,000,000 ; from <lb/>1821 to 1826, L45,000,000 ; in 1827, L51,000,000 ; and <lb/>in 1828 the amounts of exports rose to L52,000,000– <lb/>So much for the alleged decrease of our export trade, as <lb/>stated by the worthy Alderman, ( <hi rend="italic">hear, hear, hear.</hi> ) <lb/>In 1819[?] the currency was in the greatest state of depre<lb break="no"/>ciation ; but he begged pardon for having said so much, <lb/>and he was induced to offer a word in order to counter<lb break="no"/>act the danger which might arise if the statements of <lb/>the worthy Alderman remained unanswered.</p>
                <p>Mr Sec. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peel</hi>  observed, that, whenever any change, <lb/>however calculated to be ultimately beneficial, was made <lb/>in the system of our currency, it must be attended in <lb/>the first instance with considerable inconveniences. <lb/>The more he considered the subject, the more was he <lb/>convinced that the best interests of the nation required <lb/>that we should strictly adhere to the law of our cur<lb break="no"/>rency now established. ( <hi rend="italic">Hear, hear.</hi> ) He hoped he <lb/>should never see the time when the restrictions on cash <lb/>payments should be renewed. When, however, the <lb/>petitioners declared it to be expedient to increase the <lb/>amount of our currency by an issue of paper, he would <lb/>ask them what they would, in that case, do with the <lb/>Exchanges? If the Exchanges fell, the gold would <lb/>go out of the country. What would they do? They <lb/>must renew the restriction on cash payments by the <lb/>Bank. It was not any change in the value of the cur<lb break="no"/>rency, but the prosperity of Manchester that had occa<lb break="no"/>sioned the depression in Spitalfields. In 1820, the <lb/>number of factories in Manchester were fifty-four, and <lb/>they were assessed at the annual value of L16,816 ; in <lb/>1823 they were 56, assessed at L18,293 ; in 1826, when <lb/>the small notes bill passed, the numbers were 72, asses<lb break="no"/>sed at L24,034 ; in 1828, the year before the small <lb/>notes bill took effect, the numbers were 73, and they <lb/>were assessed at L25,245. The hon. gentleman oppo<lb break="no"/>site had said that no fresh capital had been employed <lb/>in this trade, but that persons would work at a loss ra<lb break="no"/>ther than let their machines stand idle. But if this <lb/>were the case, it would not account for the erection of <lb/>12 new factories, the establishment of which was irre<lb break="no"/>concileable with the idea of general stagnation. With <lb/>respect to the silk trade in Manchester, in 1823 there <lb/>were 2500 looms, and in 1828 there were 8000 ; and <lb/>there were between 3 and 4000 looms working ma<lb break="no"/>nufactured articles of silk mixed with cotton. He had <lb/>had a letter from Manchester, dated 1st of June, upon <lb/>which he could rely, and it stated that all the silk weav<lb break="no"/>ers were, or might be, in active emply. For the last <lb/>ten years at Manchester, machinery had improved in <lb/>powers of production in the ratio of 10 per cent, per an<lb break="no"/>num. Few persons had attributed enough to the im<lb break="no"/>portation of labourers from Ireland. A greater number <lb/>of Irish labourers in the manufacturing districts were <lb/>out of emply than people could imagine, and the Ma<lb break="no"/>gistrates relieved them rather than pass them to their <lb/>parishes, reflecting that as they had contributed to the <lb/>prosperity ot the places, they had a right to relief when <lb/>in distress. Where the passage was so low, and this <lb/>country possessed the advantage of a legal provision <lb/>for the poor, it was impossible to check the influx of <lb/>Irish labourers, and this fact would suggest important <lb/>alterations in the state of the law. ( <hi rend="italic">Hear, hear.</hi> ) He <lb/>felt convinced that any alterations with respect to the <lb/>values of the currency would be attended with the great<lb break="no"/>est evils to every class.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps"> W. Horton</hi>  observed, that some honourable <lb/>gentleman considered the distress of our artisans and <lb/>manufacturers to arise from the state of the currency ; <lb/>but he (Mr Horton) was at a loss to see how the redun<lb break="no"/>dant labour at Shipley could have been affected by the <lb/>change of the currency. Another class were the anti<lb break="no"/>podes of these–they imputed our distress to the corn <lb/>laws. But it was idle to talk of altering the corn laws; <lb/>we should look to practical remedies. As long as a re<lb break="no"/>dundancy of labour existed in England, which was ag<lb break="no"/>gravated by the condition of the Irish, who flocked to <lb/>England, and operated a still further prejudice to the <lb/>labouring class of this country, the distress would con<lb break="no"/>tinue. The remedy which he proposed for the evil he <lb/>had pointed out was emigration, in the manner propos<lb break="no"/>ed in the report of a committee of which he had the ho<lb break="no"/>nour to be the chairman, by parishes advancing a sum <lb/>of money to locate pauper labourers in our North Ame<lb break="no"/>rican colonies. The right hon. gentleman then read <lb/>opinions in approbation of his plan, from Mr Tooke, <lb/>Mr Malthus, Colonel Torrens, and others, and observ<lb break="no"/>ed that he had the opinion of the late Mr Ricardo to <lb/>the same effect, in a lette which had been published. <lb/>He then entered into a calculation, to show the saving <lb/>to parishes by this plan, and he challenged any member <lb/>of the house the show the fallacy of the calculations.– <lb/>There was, however, an answer so easy, that it was con<lb break="no"/>stantly made–" The vacuum would be filled up im<lb break="no"/>mediately." This was a delicate subject to touch <lb/>upon, for he knew not how the vacuum could be fill<lb break="no"/>ed up but by the introduction of young gentlemen <lb/>and ladies. ( <hi rend="italic">A laugh</hi>.) But was it supposed that <lb/>fifty labourers would be replaced immediately by fifty <lb/>children? Or did these objectors suppose that labour<lb break="no"/>ers would be brought from Russia or elsewhere ? The <lb/>right honourable gentleman then adverted to the re<lb break="no"/>marks in Mr Sadler's work, wherein it was stated that <lb/>is appeared from the official documents that the mor<lb break="no"/> 
               <cb/>tality amongst the emigrants to North America had <lb/>been in the unprecedented proportion of 4 in 14, where<lb break="no"/>as, in Wales, the proportion was 1 in 69, and in Eng<lb break="no"/>land, 1 in 57. This, he would assert, was an incorrect <lb/>statement. So far from the proportion being 1 in 14, <lb/>it was only 1 in 40, the same proportion which existed <lb/>in Carlisle, the healthiest place in England. The emi<lb break="no"/>grants, it should be recollected, carried out children, <lb/>and the mortality amongst children was in the propor<lb break="no"/>tion of 1 in 12, and in London much greater ; for it had <lb/>been ascertained that out of 1,000 infants amongst the <lb/>poor, only 542 survived the period of nursing. The <lb/>right hon. gentleman concluded with reading his last <lb/>resolution–" That it is expedient that such measures <lb/>should be adopted in the next Session of Parliament as <lb/>may furnish the most safe and effectual means of pro<lb break="no"/>ducing the desird improvement, by a judicious appli<lb break="no"/>cation of both these principles, and at the same time <lb/>under conditions which will prevent the probability of <lb/>a recurrence of similar evils, and also effect a material <lb/>saving of the national income, instead of producing an <lb/>increased charge thereon."</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Huskisson</hi>  contended that colonization ought <lb/>to be encouraged. Had it not been for emigration, <lb/>this country could never have reached its present state <lb/>of importance and prosperity, nor would our language <lb/>have been extended to the United States, and been <lb/>adopted in more distant countries. If there were one <lb/>circumstance more striking than another, it was the pro<lb break="no"/>digious increase of consumption, a proof of the growing <lb/>wealth and resources of the country. In the year 1814, <lb/>the exchange in trade was against us ; now it was in <lb/>our favour. This country would carry on its great affairs <lb/>with as small a portion of metallic currency as possi<lb break="no"/>ble, but let them guard against a system which had led <lb/>to depreciation of the currency, and the panic which <lb/>was felt in 1825. He had heard somewhere a meta<lb break="no"/>phor respecting paper currency. Like a skyrocket, it <lb/>rose with splendour, but lost its brightness, and when <lb/>its fire was extinguished it fell in darkness, like the <lb/>shaft of the rocket, upon the heads of those who had <lb/>raised it.</p>
                <p>Mr Secretary <hi rend="smallcaps">Peel</hi>  said, in consequence of the <lb/>course of policy which he had deemed it advisable to <lb/>adopt in the previous Session, a series of unfounded ca<lb break="no"/>lumnies had been levelled at him, which, however, he <lb/>had despised too much to condescend to notice. But <lb/>there was one which, as it reflected on his public and <lb/>official character, he would, with permission of the <lb/>house, allude to on that occasion. The report to which <lb/>he alluded was, that he had used his influence as Secre<lb break="no"/>tary of State to procure an enormous grant of land <lb/>for a relative of his. ( <hi rend="italic">Hear, hear, hear.</hi> ) In conse<lb break="no"/>quence of seeing this report in the public newspapers, <lb/>he had requested his right honourable friend to move <lb/>in that house, for the production of certain papers cal<lb break="no"/>culted to explain the whole matter. Those papers <lb/>had in consequence been produced, and were now <lb/>printed ; he trusted, however, that the house would <lb/>excuse him for again alluding to the subject. ( <hi rend="italic">Hear, </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">hear, hear.</hi> ) He hoped that the consequence of those <lb/>papers being printed would have been, that some mem<lb break="no"/>ber would have asked some questions on the subject ; <lb/>but though this was not the case, he had received a <lb/>communication which made him think that some one <lb/>out of doors had been imposed upon by the calumny, <lb/>though no member of that house had been so deceived, <lb/>( <hi rend="italic">cheering</hi>.) He begged in the first place, to state <lb/>most distinctly that he had procured no grant of land <lb/>for any brother of his, ( <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> ) A gentleman, whose <lb/>name was the same as his, and who was his second <lb/>cousin, had had a grant made him by his right hon. <lb/>friend ; but in that grant he begged to state to the <lb/>house, upon his word of honour, as a gentleman, he had <lb/>had no participation whatever, ( <hi rend="italic">hear</hi>.) With respect <lb/>to the settlement on the Swan River, he was ashamed <lb/>to say that he had neither heard nor knew of it, till he <lb/>received a letter from his cousin, announcing to him <lb/>that he had abandoned the idea of going to New South <lb/>Wales ; and that from the circumstances of Mr Twiss in<lb break="no"/>forming him that government would be disposed to afford <lb/>assistance to any settlers going to the Swan River, he <lb/>and three other gentlemen had been induced to send in <lb/>a proposal to that effect. With respect to the other <lb/>calumnies which had been promulgated against him, <lb/>they rather went to private matters, and he had there<lb break="no"/>fore not condescended to notice them ; but as this one <lb/>had reference to the public department in which he of<lb break="no"/>ficiated, he had thought it so far a public concern, as <lb/>to venture to ask the attention of the house while he tres<lb break="no"/>passed on it to disclaim any participation in the grant <lb/>that had been made, ( <hi rend="italic">hear.</hi>.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">Geo. Murray</hi> –The house would probably <lb/>think, after the statement of his right honourable friend, <lb/>that it would be unnecessary for him to rise to address <lb/>them, ( <hi rend="italic">hear</hi>.) He was satisfied that the house knew <lb/>that his right hon. friend was incapable of proposing <lb/>anything that would come under the designation of <lb/>what was vulgarly called a job, ( <hi rend="italic">hear</hi>.)</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Adjournment.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Mr Secretary <hi rend="smallcaps">Peel</hi>  gave notice that he should to<lb break="no"/>morrow move the adjournment of the house to that day <lb/>week. The right hon. gentleman at the same time <lb/>presented a petition from the Apothecaries Company <lb/>of London, in favour, as we understood, of the bill re<lb break="no"/>garding dissection.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Wilmot Horton</hi>  rose to propose the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions of wich he had given notic relative to the state <lb/>of the labouring poor.</p>
                <p>The firt resolution having been put from the chair,</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Chancellor</hi>  of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Exchequer</hi>  moved as <lb/>an amendment that the order of the day be now read.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Bennett</hi>  opposed the resolutions.</p>
                <p>The amendement was agreed to without a division.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Labouchere</hi>  postponed until to-morrow his <lb/>motion respecting Canada.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Slave Trade.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Otway Cave</hi>  moved the following resolutions:</p>
                <p>"Resolved, 1st. That no human legislature has any <lb/>lawful power to abridge or destroy the natural rights <lb/>of life and liberty, unless the owner shall himself com<lb break="no"/>mit some criminal act that amounts to a forfeiture.</p>
                <p>"2d, That although neither the government nor the <lb/>legislature of the county have arrogated to them<lb break="no"/>selves the power of destroying the natural rights <lb/>of innocent British subjects, or of delegating any <lb/>such power to other authorities, it is a notorious <lb/>fact, that in many British Colonies lying remote <lb/>from the immediate observation of the Government, <lb/>innocent British born subjects are, from the time of <lb/>their birth, robbed of their natural rights, and converted <lb/>into slaves.</p>
                <p>"3. That it is the especial duty of this House, as the <lb/>Representatives of the people, to take effectual measures <lb/>for protecting all British subjects that shall be born <lb/>henceforward in the West Indian Colonies, from simi<lb break="no"/>lar violations of their natural, inherent, and paramount <lb/>rights as human beings."</p>
                <p>The motion being seconded by <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Lumley,</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">W. Smith</hi>  said, he could not give his support to <lb/>these resolutions, because they were connected with a <lb/>question of too much importance to be agitated in such <lb/>a manner, and at such a period of the Session.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Huskisson</hi>  was of opinion that resolutions of <lb/>such a description as those brought forward by the hon. <lb/>member, ought to be met by a direct negative.</p>
                <p>Strangers were then ordered to withdraw. The reso<lb break="no"/>lutions were declared to be negatived without a division.</p>
                <p>The other orders of the day were then disposed of, and <lb/>the house adjourned at half-past one o'clock.</p>

From the same <lb/>quarter we have received a confirmation of what we <lb/>mentioned some time back, that according to the present <lb/>arrangements of the Court, it is certainly his Majesty's <lb/>intetion to visit Brighton before the expiration of the <lb/>year.– <hi rend="italic">Brighton Gazette.</hi>

Of late they have <lb/>assumed a more decided and promising character, and if <lb/>the seven weeks that remain prove as productive as the <lb/>first month has been, not only will thre be no falling <lb/>off at the close, but a considerable increase may confi<lb break="no"/>dently be anticipated. We understand that the general <lb/>return of duties paid at Custom-house in the port of <lb/>London, for the month o July last, amounts to one <lb/>million one hundred and ten thousand pounds. The re<lb break="no"/>turns from the out-ports have not all yet been received, <lb/>but, on a fair calculation, it is supposed that they will <lb/>amount to above one million sterling.– <hi rend="italic">Courier.</hi>

                <p>It is certainly true that Laurent made an offer of <lb/>L8000 a year for Covent Garden ; but when asked to <lb/>put his offer into writing, he withdrew, and nothing <lb/>more has been heard of it.– <hi rend="italic">Court Journal.</hi>

               <lb/>is founded upon one of the fictions of an early Italian <lb/>novelist (Lasca), the incidents of which almost include <lb/>the romatic and eventful interest of the Arabian Nights' <lb/>Entertainments. Peake is the accredited author–Keeley <lb/>is to be the hero, and Wood the principal vocalist ; G. <lb/>H. Rodwell is the composer.</p>
                <p>It is stated in a recent French paper, that during the <lb/>last eight months not fewer than twenty political and <lb/>literary journals have been started in the French pro<lb break="no"/>vinces.</p>

                <p>A carriage, containing 60 persons, was this day seen <lb/>to traverse Paris. It was drawn by six horses, merely <lb/>by way of trial.

Another steam-vessel is to <lb/>leave Bombay for the same destination in January next. <lb/>A communication by steam between this country and <lb/>the Mediterrarean has already been opened, and might, <lb/>we suppose, be easily extended to Egpyt.

               <hi rend="italic">Swan River.</hi> –That beautiful ship, the Gilmour, <lb/>sailed on Monday evening for the Swan River. She <lb/>has upwards of 200 passengers on board, the whole of <lb/>whom are highly respectable, and many of them are in <lb/>opulent circumstances. When Mr Peel came alongside <lb/>(accompanied by Mr Soltau), just before the ship got <lb/>under weigh, the passengers and crew gave him three <lb/>cheers, and his reception altogether was of the most <lb/>gratifying description. The property on board the <lb/>Gilmore alone amounts to the more than L60,000. We <lb/>understand also, that the Minstrel will call at this port <lb/>in about a fortnight to take out other settlers on ac<lb break="no"/>count of Mr Peel.

               <hi rend="italic">Gurney's Steam Carriage.</hi> –Yesterday afternoon Mr <lb/>Gurney's steam carriage was exhibited, at the request <lb/>of the Duke of Wellington, in the Houslow Barrack <lb/>yard, before his Grave, the Ladies Percy, Dance, and <lb/>Murray ; Lords Fitzroy Somerset, Rosslyn, and Tho<lb break="no"/>mas Cecil ; Lieut. General Sir W. Gordon, Quarter<lb break="no"/>Master General ; Sir George Murray, Sir Charles Dance, <lb/>and a large number of military and scientific gentlemen. <lb/>His Grace, Sir W. Gordon, the Ladies Percy, &amp;c. had <lb/>a carriage attacked, and rode round the yard with the <lb/>greatest pleasure and satisfaction. Afterwards a wag<lb break="no"/>gon was fastened to the steam carriage containing 27 <lb/>soldiers besides Mr Gurney and two or three men on <lb/>the engine, and though the road was very disadvanta<lb break="no"/>geous, being a rough loose sand and gravel, it drew <lb/>them round without the least diminuition of its speed, <lb/>between nine and ten miles an hour. In these experi<lb break="no"/>ments Mr Gurney applied his steam generally but to <lb/>one wheel in order to give the company full proof of <lb/>the power and practicability of the invention. Having <lb/>satisfied them as to this, and as to its manageability, <lb/>by a variety of involutions and evolutions, he gave them <lb/>a specimen of its speed, and drove seven or eight times <lb/>round at the rate of 16 or 17 miles an hour. It is <lb/>difficult to say whether the company was more pleased <lb/>or surprised at these unequivocal proofs of Mr Gurney's <lb/>success. The Duke of Wellington observed that it <lb/>was scarcely possible to calculate the benefits we should <lb/>derive from the introduction of such an invention as <lb/>this.</p>
                <p>The French papers of Tuesday state that the Em<lb break="no"/>peror Nicholas was preparing to make a new levy at the <lb/>rate of 4 upon every 500 male individuals, which would <lb/>give about 160,000 fresh soldiers. He is said, however, to <lb/>have deferred promulgating the ukase until he should <lb/>have ascertained that the Porte had definitely rejected <lb/>the terms of peace which he had proposed. On the <lb/>other hand, we are told that the Sultan has rejected those <lb/>terms, and that, notwithstanding the successes gained <lb/>by the Russians, he was resolved to run all the chances <lb/>of a desperate struggle rather than submit to conditions <lb/>which he deemed insulting.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">The English Bench.</hi> –There are two vacancies at <lb/>present on the judicial Bench ;–one occasioned by the <lb/>death of Mr Baron Hullock ; the other by the more <lb/>recent decease of Mr Charles Warren, Chief Justice of <lb/>Chester, who expired at his house in Bedford Square, <lb/>on Wednesday afternoon, in the 66th year of his age. <lb/>Mr Campbell is spoken of as the successor of the for<lb break="no"/>mer ; and the choise, we supposem will be generally <lb/>deemed to be a proper one. With respect to the Chief <lb/>Justiceship of Chester, an evening paer, the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi>, very <lb/>properly recalls to public recollection the fact, that "the <lb/>Commissioners on the Common Law had recommended <lb/>in their report, the abolition of the Welsh judgeships <lb/>altogether;" and adds an opinion, in which we per<lb break="no"/>fectly coincide, tht " the present seems a fair op<lb break="no"/>portunity for carrying the recommendation into effect." <lb/>Indeed, in our mind, every opportunity is a fair one <lb/>for reducing public expences, when public burdens are <lb/>oppressive.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Platina Coin.</hi> –We have seen a specimen of the <lb/>new Russian platina coinage. The coin is about the <lb/>size of a shilling, but heavier than a sovereign, and of <lb/>three roubles value. On one side are the Russian eagle <lb/>and imperial arms; on the other the value of the coin, <lb/>and date– <hi rend="italic">Globe.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Ugly Wives Fittest for Poets.</hi> –The spouses of the <lb/>living British poets are well known to be among the plain<lb break="no"/>est of the <hi rend="italic">sect</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">Mr Slinslop</hi>  would say.–is wed<lb break="no"/>ded to the head of a gorgon, – – is not much better <lb/>off, – – has eloped from his mate. We might run <lb/>through the whole catalogue, without discovering a <lb/>handsome woman, yet none have exceleed these writers <lb/>in descriptions of female beauty. The truth is, that <lb/>the contemplation of a bottle or peaked nose, a wide <lb/>mouth, goggle eyes, and a spare body, causes an author <lb/>to set out with more enthusiasm in search of the ideal <lb/>of womanly perfections, and affords the widest scope to <lb/>the imagination. Nothing impedes the fancy more <lb/>domestic intercourse with a celestial shape and di<lb break="no"/>vine face ; in which case a fatal uxoriousness supersedes <lb/>the poet's diligence, and he ceases impotently to de<lb break="no"/>scribe what he can well enjoy. Milton's Eve was not <lb/>copied from Mrs Milton grilling his dinner at the kitch<lb break="no"/>en fire–but from some unattainable damsel of his fan<lb break="no"/>cy. Plurality of women is only allowed to a poet– <lb/>one lawful, plain, household wife–and as many airy <lb/>mistresses as he can embody.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Swan River.</hi> –The ship Warrior, Stone, command<lb break="no"/>er, bound to Swan River, Sydney, and the East Indies, <lb/>sailed for her destination on Friday, from Portsmouth, <lb/>with prospects of favourable weather in her progress <lb/>down the Channel. The Warrior is a fine vessel of <lb/>about 700 tons burden, and carried out upwards of 250 <lb/>passengers to the new settlement. Several of the pas<lb break="no"/>sengers are persons of independent fortune, who have <lb/>embarked considerable property in the speculation ; and <lb/>and two ofthem, named Byrne and Molloy, paid the <lb/>enormous sum of L1,000 for the best accommodation <lb/>the vessel could afford their families and suite. Six <lb/>pianos are on board the Warrior, and a proportionate <lb/>number of fair and accomplished vocalists and musicians <lb/>of course accompany the instruments to their destina<lb break="no"/>tion. The Warrior has also on board fifty dogs of the <lb/>choicest breed, several pens of sheep, considerable <lb/>number of swine, two milch cows, and three valuable <lb/>horses ; but, as tempestuous weather may be antici<lb break="no"/>pated on the vessel reaching the Bay of Biscay, appre<lb break="no"/>hensions are entertained that a portion of the live cargo <lb/>must be consigned to the ocean before the termination <lb/>of the voyage. It is calculated that, from the advan<lb break="no"/>tageous arrangements entered into by the commander <lb/>and a gentleman named Semple, who has chartered the <lb/>Warrior, and gone out in her, they will clear the enor<lb break="no"/>mous sum of L10,000 by the voyage.</p>
