               <hi rend="enlarged-capital">T </hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">his Report</hi>  only reached us yesterday ; but the So<lb break="no"/>ciety brings so much benevolence into activity, under the <lb/>guidance of practical wisdom, aided by very enlightened <lb/>views of the best interests of society, that we consider any <lb/>delay improper in calling the attention of the public to <lb/>their valuable proceedings. The present Report abounds <lb/>with evidence that they have not relaxed in their exer<lb break="no"/>tions. At home, not only are the laws improving, but the <lb/>magistracy are carrying improvements into all the practical <lb/>departments. A great many jails, designed on much bet<lb break="no"/>ter principlpes, are in progress in different parts of the <lb/>country ; and in those which are used, it may be said, <hi rend="italic">ge<lb break="no"/>nerally</hi>, that much more attentions is paid to health, clean<lb break="no"/>liness, diet, employment, and classification. It must not <lb/>be thought, however, that nothing remains to be done. <lb/>There are still jails in which prisoners are double ironed, <lb/>and chained to the floor of their cels from night to morn<lb break="no"/>ing ; others in which persons committed <hi rend="italic">for trial</hi>  are fet<lb break="no"/>tered with irons of the weight of from seven to nine pounds ; <lb/>and others in which debtors are exposed to the contami<lb break="no"/>nating society of criminals, in which neither the various <lb/>classes of prisoners, nor the two sexes, are kept separate <lb/>from each other, and in which all are allowed to be idle. <lb/>The Magistrates of Surrey have provided a <hi rend="italic">covered</hi>  vehicle <lb/>for conveying prisoners to the Sessions'house ; but in the <lb/>metropolis, it would appear, the practise still continues of <lb/>inflicting public degradation on parties arraigned or merely <lb/>suspected of crime, by marching them <hi rend="italic">handcuffed</hi>  through the <lb/>streets of London ; and, very recently, a party of <hi rend="italic">one hun- </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">dred prisoners</hi>  were marched for a mile <hi rend="italic">handcuffed </hi>
               <lb/>through the open streets, <hi rend="italic">in order to be formally set at liber- </hi>

               <hi rend="italic">ty by proclamation !</hi>  So much for metropolitan decorum ! <lb/>These shameful exhibitions and practises cannot, however, <lb/>long maintain their ground ; the publicity given to them, <lb/>through the proceedings of the Society should, of itself, be <lb/>enough to do them away ; but while they are continued <lb/>England should be somewhat chary of her boasts. The <lb/>views and principles of the Prison Society are attracting <lb/>notice and gaining ground in France, Switzerland, the Ne<lb break="no"/>therlands, Hanover, Bavaria, Wurtemberg, Denmark, Nor<lb break="no"/>way, Sweden, and Russia. At Christiana the Magistrates <lb/>have already resolved on the erection of a new city gaol. In <lb/>St Petersburgh the prisoners are now furnished with food, <lb/>clothing, baths, and medical assistance. A Ladies' Asso<lb break="no"/>ciation, under the patronage of the Princess <hi rend="smallcaps">Mesthersky</hi>, <lb/>is also in full activity at St Petersburgh ; and there is an <lb/>auxiliary prison society at Orel, on the very frontiers of Sibe<lb break="no"/>ria. Seven thousand prisoners passed through Orel last year ; <lb/>but their chains have been lightened, and their condition <lb/>meliorated generally, through the exertions of the Russian <lb/>Society. For details, however, we must refer to the Re<lb break="no"/>port itself ; but we cannot take leave of it without making <lb/>special notice of the benefits conferred on society by <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Female Associations</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Temporary Refuge</hi>. The <lb/>almost miraculous power of kindness, when accompanied, <lb/>as genuine kindness often is, with quiet feeling and unob<lb break="no"/>trusive goodness, continues to be exemplified in the Ladies' <lb/>Committee, of which Mrs <hi rend="smallcaps">Fry</hi>, we believe, is still at the head. <lb/>In Newgate, idleness, dissipation, and licentiousness, have <lb/>been succeeded by industry, order, and restraint ; and the <lb/>same committee accomplish much good by visiting the ships <lb/>in which convicts are embarked for New South Wales. <lb/>Arrangements are thus made for the formation of schools <lb/>for moral and religious instruction during the voyage, and <lb/>the convicts are furnished not only with suitable clothing <lb/>and other necessaries, but the means of employment in the <lb/>manufacture of such articles as may be readily sold for their <lb/>relief on arriving at the colony. These are truly good <lb/>works ; and too much praise cannot be bestowed on the <lb/>Ladies by whom they are performed. It is gratifying to <cb/>observe that Female Associations for visiting prisons have <lb/>been established in Bedford, Bristol, Carlisle, Colchester, <lb/>Derby, Dumfries, Durham, Exeter, Lancaster, Notting<lb break="no"/>ham, Plymouth, York, and <hi rend="italic">Glasgow</hi>. We had once thought <lb/>that, by this time, we might have added <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi>  ; and <lb/>we are inclined to hope that the present Lord Pro<lb break="no"/>vost will yet employ his influence in establishing a La<lb break="no"/>dy's Society for the prisons of our Metropolis.– <lb/>There, too, we had cherished, and still cherish, the hope, <lb/>of seeing a House of Refuge. The temporary refuge of <lb/>the Prison Society is chiefly for affording relief to distress<lb break="no"/>ed boys, who, on their discharge from the prisons of the <lb/>metropolis, have expressed a desire to abandon their crimi<lb break="no"/>nal courses. Many of these are in circumstances of urgent <lb/>want ; and " the Committee can now look round wtih plea<lb break="no"/>sure on many who are variously settled, and <hi rend="italic">conducting them- </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">selves</hi>  exemplarily. In the temporary refuge they are <lb/>trained up to habits of industry, instructed in moral and <lb/>religious duty, and after a time are provided with suitable <lb/>situations." There is a great similarity in the histories of <lb/>the individuals admitted into this asylum ; but the greater <lb/>number, obviously, consists of boys, who had been almost <lb/>driven to commit petty thefts from want of employment or <lb/>destitution, or who, from neglect or loss of parents, had <lb/>fallen into the company of professed thieves. The Commit<lb break="no"/>tee mention that on one recent occasion, no less than <hi rend="italic">eight </hi>
               <lb/>boys were released from Newgate in one day, and imme<lb break="no"/>diately after they had undergone the sentence of <hi rend="italic">flogging, </hi>
               <lb/>which, upon some insane rule, is usually carried into ef<lb break="no"/>fect on the day of their discharge. Their persons are thus <lb/>marked with the stigma of guilt, and, from soreness and <lb/>want of strength, they are disabled from working, at the <lb/>very time they ought to go in search of employment. No <lb/>more effectual plan could have been devised to irritate these <lb/>boys against society, to prevent them from obtaining employ<lb break="no"/>ment, though desirous of it, or to impel them to recommence <lb/>their career of crime. We entreat those who are inclined to <lb/>look upon what they call a <hi rend="italic">smart whipping</hi>  as the only corrective <lb/>for juvenile offences, to reflect a little on the consequences <lb/>to which their system inevitably tends. <hi rend="italic">We</hi>  are decidedly, <lb/>and in all cases, against the deliberate infliction of pain, <lb/>merely to be felt as such. In the case of children, if not <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi>  for that purpose, it will certainly give them the <lb/>idea of power superior to their own, and may thus be the <lb/>means of constraining more readily than otherwise ; but <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">the law</hi>, when it inflicts pain, has always other means of <lb/>evincing its power, and constraining those who are within <lb/>its grasp. Its most important function is to <hi rend="italic">prevent crime ; </hi>
               <lb/>its next is o convince those who comit offences that the <lb/>means of detection are, on the whole, so sure that no<lb break="no"/>thing is to be gained by the commission ; and its next, to <lb/>make restitution onerous and complete. There may also <lb/>be some classes of criminals who ought to be considered <lb/>and treated as <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> –some are curable ; and some as incur<lb break="no"/>ably furious, who must either be cut off altogether, or <lb/>confined for life. We are not opposed to the infliction <lb/>of punishments, because in our opinion the most effec<lb break="no"/>tual of those will be found to consist in the best means <lb/>of preventing or remedying the evils produced by crime. <lb/>All exposures, restraints, constraints, and compulsory re<lb break="no"/>parations are punishments. We are only hostile to the inflic<lb break="no"/>tion of pain for no other purpose but because pain is produced. <lb/>If it can be made <hi rend="italic">obvious</hi>  to the sufferers that the pain inflicted <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">protects others</hi>, or affords <hi rend="italic">true reparation</hi>  for the wrongs <lb/>done to them or society, we shall then grant that such pu<lb break="no"/>nishments may be both just and expedient. The Prison <lb/>Society, while they vindicate themselves, temperately but <lb/>firmly, from the charge of having yielded to a sort of blind <lb/>and irrational benevolence, and advocated measures which <lb/>went to raise the condition of prisoners above that of com<lb break="no"/>mon labourers, do still seem to us to have been too much <lb/>moved by the coarse jokes and reckless speculations of a <lb/>clever essayist. If they err at all, they seem now to be <lb/>somewhat too indulgent to the advocates of hard labour <lb/>and severe punishments. We are rather inclined to think <lb/>them too decidely in favour of the tread mill, which they <lb/>allow has been so worked or constructed at different places <cb/>as to form very unequal measures of punishment, and they <lb/>very properly insist that every tread-mill should be pro<lb break="no"/>vided with " a regulator," by which its rate of revolution <lb/>may at all times be restrained within safe limits, and a <lb/>dial-register, (lately invented by Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Bate</hi>, instrument<lb break="no"/>maker to the Board of Excise) by which the rate of labour <lb/>may be, at any time, accurately ascertained, and which <lb/>( they think ) should in no case exceed 12,000 feet in ascent <lb/>for one day. There is an able argument in the report against <lb/>compelling persons to labour who are merely imrpisoned <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">for trial</hi>  : and there is a great mass of curious and useful <lb/>information in the Appendix.</p>

                <p>In January, 1823, there were 3,031 in the hulks ; 2,138 have <lb/>been received since ; 1,402 have been sent to New South Wales ; <lb/>and 300 to <hi rend="italic">Bermuda</hi>  ; 468 have been discharge by pardon or <lb/>transferred to other establishments ; 3 have escaped ; 43 have died ; <lb/>and 2,953 remained in the different hulks on 1st Janury last. <lb/>The health of these prisoners has been good, their conduct or<lb break="no"/>derly.</p>
                <p>The Office-bearers of the <hi rend="italic">Refuge for the Destitute</hi>  have, during <lb/>the last year, given relief to 424 persons. They have apprenticed <lb/>to trades, recommended to service or employment, or restored to pa<lb break="no"/>rents and friends, 214 individuals :–under their charge at present <lb/>154. Most of the male culprits require to be kept two years at <lb/>least. The expenditure has been very considerable. Mr Peel has <lb/>recommended a grant from Parliament.</p>
                <p>As we feared, the bill introduced for the purpose of qualifying <lb/>persons possessed of personal property to serve as juries contains <lb/>no regulations for the more impartial striking of juries, or returning <lb/>or making up of those who are to serve on each jury. There does <lb/>seem to be an improvement on the <hi rend="italic">form</hi>  of the returns to be made <lb/>by the Constables to the Sheriffs.</p>

                <p>Repeated instances have lately occurred, in whcih dwelling<lb break="no"/>houses have suffered damage by fire, owing to the carelessnes of <lb/>servants and others, who, by way of economy, take off fires at <lb/>night and put the burning coals under the grate, not recollecting <lb/>that, in the construction of almost every house, the stone placed <lb/>under the grate is supported by timber, separated from the hearth <lb/>stone by some lime only. The wood underneath being once ig<lb break="no"/>nited, the fire will rapidly spread, and may in a few hours involve <lb/>the whole tenement in flames.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to Australia.</hi> –We understand that the esta<lb break="no"/>blishment of an Australian Company has suggested to a num<lb break="no"/>ber of public spirited individuals the idea of forming a society to <lb/>aid deserving persons in their endeavours to emigrate and settle in <lb/>New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, and that matters are <lb/>actually in progress for carrying this benevolent project into effect. <lb/>On Wednesday a meeting was held in the Freemasons' Hall, Niddry <lb/>Street, which was respectably attended, the Rev. Mr Lothian in <lb/>the Chair, when a series of resolutions were moved by William <lb/>Ellis, Esq. S. S. C., and seocnd by Robert Paul, Esq. of the <lb/>Commercial Bank. The principal object comprehended in those <lb/>were the security of the persons and property of emigrants on the <lb/>voyage–the maintenance of a regular communication with friends <lb/>left behind, and the insuring a friendly welcome, temporary ac<lb break="no"/>commodation, and facilities for permanent settlement in the country <lb/>of their adoption. It was also proposed to give assistance in <lb/>money to deserving emigrants, for the purpose of defraying the <lb/>expenses of freight and passage out–every applicant being first <lb/>well recommended, and his character subjected to strict scrutiny. <lb/>Masons, wrights, smiths, and other artisans, schoolmasters, farm<lb break="no"/> servants, and labourers, are the classes to which the principles of <lb/>the society specially apply.</p>
                <p>According to the opinion of persons largely engaged in the silk<lb break="no"/>trade, the amount of drawback to be allowed on silk that has paid <lb/>the duty will be between t300,000 and t400,000.</p>
                <p>On Sunday evening a disturbance took place in a house in <lb/>Tobago Street, and the Police were called, who, to make sure of <lb/>the rioter, secured the door ; at which a young woman, a servant, <lb/>became so much alarmed, that she leaped out of a window, situat<lb break="no"/>ed on the third floor, whereby her back was broken. She now lies <lb/>very ill in the Royal Infirmary.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">The Army</hi> –The several Recruiting Parties throughout <lb/>Great Britain and Ireland having received their instructions, are <lb/>now actively employed in raising men for the three new Regi<lb break="no"/>ments of the Line, whose establishments, it is expected, will be <lb/>in a very short time completed. The Head-quarters of the 97th <lb/>Regiment are changedfrom Gosport to Winchester.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Secretary Peel</hi>, in moving the commitment of the Trans<lb break="no"/>portation Bill, stated, that the objects of the bill were, first, to <lb/>continue the laws on transportation, that would expire before the <lb/>next session ; and next, to cimplify the law. In the last session <lb/>a bill had been passed to enable the Crown to make an experiment <lb/>of the union of the hulk and transportation system, by sending <lb/>convicts to Bermuda. There had been as yet hardly time to de<lb break="no"/>cide fully on the experiment, but, as far as it could be judged of, it <lb/>was satisfactory. It had been hithero complained that transporta<lb break="no"/>tion was a very esqual punishment, and certainly there was a great <lb/>different in the effect of the punishment upon a man of settled ha<lb break="no"/>bits, and with a family, and upon a man of no fixed habits, to whom, <lb/>as hitherto managed, it had scarcely been a punishment. He wish<lb break="no"/>ed it to be known, that arrangements had been made in New South <lb/>Wales, to send some of the convicts to a distant part of the set<lb break="no"/>tlement, where the punishment would be more severe. A selection <lb/>would be made from the convicts, so as to make the punishment <lb/>efficient against those to whom it had hitherto had no terror.– <lb/>He gave this statement because it was right the public should <lb/>know that transportation would be henceforward a real punishment.</p>

                <p>Mr Greig, after stating the correspondence which took place be<lb break="no"/>tween him and the Fiscal, which led to the suppression of his jour<lb break="no"/>nal, gives the following account of his interview with that func<lb break="no"/>tionary. "On Monday evening, the Fiscal sent a messenger to <lb/>me, requesting I would call at his house, in Strand-street; I did <lb/>so ; he then opened a conversation upon the subject of my paper, <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">The South African Commercial Advertiser</hi>, and said he was in<lb break="no"/>structed to inform me that I had departed from the Prospectus – <lb/>that it was become obnoxious to the Government, and referred <lb/>more particularly to the last three or four Numbers. I asked him <lb/>to point out such parts as were immediately objectionable. He then <lb/>mentioned some <hi rend="italic">leading remarks</hi>, which (he said) bore upon the <lb/>Administration of the Colony. He further pointed out as " <hi rend="italic">ob- </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">noxious,</hi> " all quotations which had been made from " De Lolne[?], <lb/>"Blackstone," and " Civil Servant's"work " Lacon," and, ge<lb break="no"/>nerally all extracts relative to the Liberty of the Press, observing <lb/>–" Nobody can doubt the obvious tendency of these ; and, as we <lb/>are not men in this Colony, but merely infants," it was, in his opi<lb break="no"/>nion, dangerous to insert such matter. He added, also, that it was <lb/>expected I should, in future, publish no parts of trials, but wait <lb/>until the whole were finished ; and, even then, all scurrilous parts <lb/>(such as the Memorial of Mr L. Cooke to the Treasury), were to <lb/>be omitted. That I was further to bound down with two sure<lb break="no"/>ties, in the penalty of ten thousand rix-dollars, that nothing of the <lb/>offensive nature pointed out, should appear in any future number ; <lb/>and, lastly, that I was to take particular care, that the next num<lb break="no"/>ber (18) contained no matter of the description alluded to, nor any <lb/>notice of Mr Edward's trial. To all this, I replied, that I would <lb/>give no promise as to what would appear in the next or any future <lb/>number. That I required time to consider what was fitting to be <lb/>done with regard to the security demanded."</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The Morning Chronicle</hi>  makes the following remarks on this <lb/>case :– We cannot say that we are surprised that acts of this de<lb break="no"/>scription should take place in our Colonies. Uncontrouled power <lb/>produces every day in Europe the worst effects on men of the best <lb/>dispositions, and the best talents, and the Governors of our con<lb break="no"/>quered Colonies, and New South Wales, are unfortunately <lb/>quite absolute. In Europe the people under absolute Governments <lb/>have this advantage over the people in our colonies, that men in <lb/>office are generally selected with some reference to abilities and ac<lb break="no"/>quirements. But with the exception of the East Indies, the Go<lb break="no"/>nernment of which, with all its faults, generally, we believe, avails <lb/>itself of talents, our colonies are unfortunately considered as mere <lb/>places of refuge for the relatives of our Aristocracy, of whom nothing <lb/>can be made in this country. This is what constitutes fitness for a <lb/>Colonial Office ; and so far from being astonished at the disgrace<lb break="no"/>ful scenes which are constantly taking place in the colonies, every <lb/>person capable of reflecting at all upon the matter would be asto<lb break="no"/>nished were he to find common abilities the holder of a colonial <lb/>appointment of any value. Of Lord Charles Somerset, the less that <lb/>is said the better. In fact nothing is more wanted than the perusal <lb/>of a Cape of Good Hope Almanack, to satisfy the British public <lb/>what sort of personage he is. Would it be believe, that in a <lb/>country of boundless extent, with only a settlement here and there, <lb/>where the greatest enemies the Colonists have to contend with, are <lb/>the wild animals, it could possible enter in to the head of any ra<lb break="no"/>rional being to introduce laws for the preservation of game. One <lb/>would as soon expect to hear laws in Turkey for the preservation <lb/>of the plague. Yet it so happens, that a code which would do <lb/>credit to Sir John Shelley himself, guarding against the possible <lb/>disinction of the game of Africa, occupies a goodly space in the <lb/>Cape Almanack. After such a specimen of wisdom, all criticism on <lb/>this personage would be thrown away.</p>
