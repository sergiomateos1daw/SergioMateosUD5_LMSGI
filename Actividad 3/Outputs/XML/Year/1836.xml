               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration.</hi> –It will be observed, from an adver<lb break="no"/>tisement in to-day's paper, that Government are fitting <lb/>another ship for the <hi rend="italic">free</hi>  conveyance of single females <lb/>from London to Van Dieman's Land ; and from the <lb/>great demand for agricultural labourers, and mecha<lb break="no"/>nics of every description, in that colony, it has been <lb/>resolved to grant a passage to that class, at a cost not <lb/>above what is paid to America–Government paying <lb/>the remainder of the sum as a bounty, amounting to <lb/>t30, which may certainly be looked upon as a great <lb/>boon, both by individuals and the colony at large. In <lb/>all the colonies there appears to be a scarcity of work<lb break="no"/>ing people, as from an official document in our posses<lb break="no"/>sion, it is asserted, on authority, that in Upper Canada <lb/>agricultural labourers, domestic servants, and trades<lb break="no"/>men of every description, will be for some years in <lb/>great request. Farm labourers readily obtain from <lb/>t25 to t30 per annum, with board, lodging, and <lb/>washing, and day-labourers from 3s. to 4s. per day, <lb/>with provisions. The government agent for emigra<lb break="no"/>tion for the Canadas asserts he could find imme<lb break="no"/>diate employment for 20,000 working people, as pub<lb break="no"/>lic improvements are much retarded for want of hands. <lb/>As this is the best season, we would advise all those <lb/>intending to emigrate to apply to the government <lb/>agent for emigration at the Custom House, Leith, <lb/>who will give gratuitous information regarding the <lb/>colonies, and advise as to the best method of putting <lb/>their plans into execution. The rate of wages for <lb/>every description of mechanics may be likewise seen <lb/>there.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Australian Colonies</hi>.–We have seen a print<lb break="no"/>ed circular containing extracts of a letter from Mr <lb/>John Sullivan, surgeon-superintendent of the Emi<lb break="no"/>grant ship <hi rend="italic">Canton</hi>, dated Sydney, 6th October 1835, <lb/>addressed to Edward Forster, Esq. chairman of the <lb/>Emigration Committee, London. In this letter Mr <lb/>Sullivan mentions that the female emigrants, on land<lb break="no"/>ing, were placed in spacious and commodious build<lb break="no"/>ings, adjoining the Government House, at Syd<lb break="no"/>ney, where every attention was paid to their com<lb break="no"/>fort and security from improper intrusion. The <lb/>writer further states :–" We landed in Sydney a <lb/>greater proportion of well conducted, industrious, and <lb/>virtuous young women, than were ever before landed <lb/>from any of the ships of the Emigration Committee <lb/>that came to these Colonies. Three-fourths of the <lb/>young women were engaged, and went into comfort<lb break="no"/>able situations, on the first and second days after land<lb break="no"/>ing ; and before a week all the useful and good ser<lb break="no"/>vants, viz. laundresses, cooks, servants of all work, <lb/>dairymaids, and housekeepers, were in places, many <lb/>of them in Syndey and the surroundings districts ; se<lb break="no"/>veral were taken up the country to Maitland and <lb/>Bathurst ; and as many more cooks, laundresses, dairy<lb break="no"/>maids, or farm servants as we had, could obtain places <lb/>in that time, for these are the descriptions of female <lb/>servants in demand throughout the colony. The <lb/>wages varied from t8 to t20. Some, who were not <lb/>very good servants of all work and housemaids, got <lb/>t8 to t10 ; cooks and laundresses, t12 to t16 (the <lb/>latter are much wanted) ; housemaids and needlewo<lb break="no"/>men, t10 to t12 ; housekeepers, t16 to t20. Go<lb break="no"/>vernesses also are much sought for it ; if we had had <lb/>twenty qualified they could have got situations in <lb/>respectable families and schools ; but the salaries to <lb/>this class are small, say t25 to t40. Nursery gover<lb break="no"/>nesses got t20. All the male emigrants who under<lb break="no"/>stood agriculture, or the management of stock in ge<lb break="no"/>neral, but particularly sheep, were engaged imme<lb break="no"/>diately, at salaries varying from t40 to t50, with a <lb/>house and rations for family use." We understand <lb/>that the <hi rend="italic">Canton</hi>  had a number of females from Edin<lb break="no"/>burgh and its neighbourhood, and the above informa<lb break="no"/>tion must be highly satisafactory to their relatives.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir George Clerk.</hi> –As the cawing of the rooks <lb/>portends a storm, it is worth while to mention that <lb/>the cunning baronet has come down from London, <lb/>and commenced a canvass in this county within these <lb/>few days. It is stated, we believe upon good autho<lb break="no"/>rity, that he accounts for this course of proceeding, <lb/>by referring to the great probability of the Lords <lb/>throwing out the Irish Municipal Bill.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Burn's Monument.</hi> –We understand that there <lb/>is now an early prospect of the completion of this <lb/>monument, which has too long remained in an un<lb break="no"/>finished state, to the surprise of strangers, and the <lb/>discredit to our Modern Athens. The sum already <lb/>in the Treasurer's hands, aided by the profits of the <lb/>handsome musical work lately issued by Mr M'Leod, <lb/>which he has generously devoted to that purpose, is <lb/>now nearly sufficient to meet the calculations of the <lb/>expense requird for the railing in and decoration of <lb/>the ground around the monument. We expect, there<lb break="no"/>fore, that the work will forthwith be commenced, and <lb/>if a few pounds are still wanted, we have no doubt <lb/>there are hundreds in Edinburgh who would wil<lb break="no"/>lingly guarantee the Treasurer against any loss by <lb/>the immediate completion of the undertaking.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Annuity Tax.</hi> –We understand that deputations <lb/>from several places in the country, are expected to <lb/>attend the public meeting which is to be held on <lb/>Tuesday evening, for the purpose of petitioning Par<lb break="no"/>liament for the abolition of the Annuity Tax, in order <lb/>to testify their abhorrence of that system of politico<lb break="no"/> Christianity which requires distraint and imprison<lb break="no"/>ment for its support. We observe that Mr Gillon, of <lb/>Wallhouse, M.P. is to take the chair. The meeting <lb/>we doubt not, will be most numerously attended.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Law of Scotland.</hi> –The prizes given by Pro<lb break="no"/>fessor Bell, for the greatest proficiency in the exami<lb break="no"/>nations, were yesterday awarded to Mr William Neish, <lb/>25, India Street, in the senior, and to William Spence, <lb/>31, Broughton Place, in the junior class. The fol<lb break="no"/>lowing gentlemen also distinguished themselves in the <lb/>competition : Mr John Fraser, James Gilchrist, <lb/>James Mason, James Scott, in the senior class; <lb/>James Oliver, David Gale, John R.

               <hi rend="italic">Kilwinning, March</hi>  30.–The United Associate <lb/>Presbytery of Kilmarnock met at Kilwinning on <lb/>Tuesday, the 22d March, and ordained Mr A. Mac<lb break="no"/>gregor to the pastoral charge of the congregation in <lb/>that place. The Rev. D. Henderson, of Dalry, <lb/>preached and presided. The Rev. Mr Cairns, of <lb/>Stewarton, ordained, and the Rev D. Ronald, of Salt<lb break="no"/>coats, gave the charge to the minister and congrega<lb break="no"/>tion. On the Sabbath following, the Rev. Mr Tait, <lb/>of Barrhead, introduced Mr Macgregor to his con<lb break="no"/>gregation ; and there is every prospect that the hither<lb break="no"/>to long disappointed congregation of Kilwinning will <lb/>now prosper under the pastoral care of their much <lb/>esteemed and highly talented young minister.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Presentation of Plate.</hi> –Mr A. S. Walker, late of <lb/>the Commercial Bank of Scotland, at present manager <lb/>of the branch of the Commercial Bank of England, <lb/>at Uttoxeter, in Staffordshire, was lately presented <lb/>with an elegant tea service by the proprietors of that <lb/>establishment, bearing the following inscription :– <lb/>"Presented to Mr Archibald S. Walker, by the <lb/>Uttoxeter Proprietors of the Commercial Bank of <lb/>England, as a small acknowledgement of his faithful <lb/>and valuable services–March, 1836." This is ano<lb break="no"/>ther proof of the estimation in which many of the <lb/>young men are held who have been trained to the <lb/>banking system in this country. <cb/>From a Return, just published, we find that the <lb/>emigration to Canada has been comparatively small <lb/>last year. The whole number of emigrants landed at <lb/>Quebec and Montreal in 1835, was 12,527 : in 1831 <lb/>and 1832 four times, and in 1834 two times as many <lb/>were sent out. Of the 12,527, there were 5597 adult <lb/>males, 3866 females, and 3064 children under 14 <lb/>years. Of the whole number, 1043 were sent out by <lb/>parochial aid. The numbers from the three king<lb break="no"/>doms were– <lb/>England, 3067 <lb/>Ireland, 7,108 <lb/>Scotland, 2,127 <lb/>From Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, &amp;c. 225 <lb/>Settled in Lower Canada, 2,297 <lb/>Upper Canada, 9,800 <lb/>Died at Grosse Isle and Quebec, 13 <lb/>Returned to the United Kingdom, 117 <lb/>Removed to the United States, 300 <lb/>–12,527</p>
                <p>But besides those who went to Canada, 16,749 <lb/>landed at New York, raising the whole number of <lb/>emigrants to 29,376. There were no less than three <lb/>vessels wrecked last year on their way to Quebec– <lb/>the William Ewing from Londonderry with 300 pas<lb break="no"/>sengers, all saved–the barque James from Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, all saved–and the Nathaniel Graham from <lb/>Cork, with 48 persons on board, passengers and crew, <lb/>of whom 41 were lost.</p>
                <p>From another part of the Report, we find that 2764 <lb/>female emigrants were sent out to Australia last year, <lb/>under the superintendence of the Emigration Com<lb break="no"/>mittee. Of these 2105 had a free passage. The ar<lb break="no"/>rangements seem to have been ood ; for the mortality <lb/>was small, and few complaints were made. The fe<lb break="no"/>males were all of decent character, and due care was <lb/>taken on their arrival to get them disposed of as ser<lb break="no"/>vants, in situations where their morals would not be <lb/>exposed to unnecessary risk.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Ulster Railway.</hi> –Length 36 miles, from Bel<lb break="no"/>fast to Armagh ; capital t600,000, in 12,000 shares, <lb/>of which t393,000 are subscribed. The number of <lb/>passengers expected is 450,000; the expected income <lb/>is t93,000, of which t67,800 is from passengers ; <lb/>the estimated expense of the work is t539,000. The <lb/>steepest gradient is 1 in 200. There are 3 tunnels of <lb/>310, 320, and 570 yards in length.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">East Lothian Railway.</hi> –We call attention <lb/>with great pleasure to the Prospectus of a railway <lb/>from Dunbar to Edinburgh, by Haddington and <lb/>Tranent, which appears in our first page. No one <lb/>can have travelled over the ground without observing <lb/>how admirably it is fitted for this species of commu<lb break="no"/>nication, by its remarkable uniformity of surface. We <lb/>should have doubted whether such a work would pay, <lb/>had it terminated at Edinburgh ; but as a part of an <lb/>unbroken line reaching across the most fertile and <lb/>populous parts of Scotland, from the German ocean <lb/>to the Atlantic, its chances of success are vastly in<lb break="no"/>creased.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Dundee and Arbroath Railway.</hi> –The Com<lb break="no"/>mittee's report on this railway has reached us, but we <lb/>must confine ourselves to an abstract. The length <lb/>is 16 miles 5 furlongs and 90 yards ; the capital <lb/>t100,000, divided into 4000 shares, which is all sub<lb break="no"/>scribed, but authority is taken to raise t40,000 more <lb/>by loan ; sum paid up t5000 ; subscribed by share<lb break="no"/>holders locally interested t88,900, by others t7150 : <lb/>there are three subscribers for t2000 and upwards : <lb/>the expected income from passengers is t16,912, <lb/>goods t14,654, from both t31,566. There are no <lb/>tunnels, no inclined planes, and the steepest gradient <lb/>being only 1 in 1000, scarcely differs from a dead <lb/>level. It does not cross any highway or turnpike on a <lb/>level. The estimated expenses is t99,844.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Statute Labour Acts.</hi> –It appears from the <lb/>votes of the House of Commons, that a Select Com<lb break="no"/>mittee has been appointed to investigate the Scottish <lb/>Statute Labour Acts, and to consider what amend<lb break="no"/>ments may be made thereon. It may be stated, that <lb/>by the present act for this county, proprietors of land, <lb/>and several other descriptions of people are totally <lb/>exempted from any burden, on account of the coaches, <lb/>chaises, gigs, or saddle horses they may keep, though <lb/>it is quite plain good roads are of as much advantage <lb/>to them as to the occupiers of land, upon whom almost <lb/>the sole burden is thrown. In many parishes a con<lb break="no"/>siderable addition would be made to the road funds, <lb/>were no such exemptions allowed. At present the <lb/>management is vested in heritors, rated at one hun<lb break="no"/>dred pounds Scots and upwards, though it is stated <lb/>with confidence, that were the occupiers of land in<lb break="no"/>cluded, beneficial consequences would follow.– <hi rend="italic">East- </hi>

               <hi rend="italic">Leith Mechanics' Friendly Assurance Society.</hi> – <lb/>The fifth annual meeting of this Institution was held <lb/>on Tuesday last–John Hutton, Esq., one of the <lb/>Honorary Members, President of the Society, in the <lb/>chair. A very satisfactory report for the last year was <lb/>read, and thanks were voted to the different Office<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>bearers. It appears that this society was established <lb/>under the countenance of the Magistrates and Minis<lb break="no"/>ters, and various influential individuals in Leith, and <lb/>is well deserving of encouragement, as affording the <lb/>benefits of mutual insurance to the working classes, <lb/>the lowest rates consistent with perfect security. <lb/>The funds, we understand, are in a prosperous state.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Hay and Straw.</hi> –In consequence of it having been <lb/>alleged last Wednesday, that higher prices were got <lb/>for straw than those quoted, we have made due in<lb break="no"/>quiry, and find there are no grounds for such an alle<lb break="no"/>gation. We have been further assured, that in re<lb break="no"/>porting the prices of hay and straw for these two years <lb/>past, the clerk of the corn market has never shown a <lb/>desire to favour the farm servants at the expense of <lb/>their employers, or to favour either party at the ex<lb break="no"/>pense of the public.</p>
                <p>The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have <lb/>been pleased to grant by their warrant, dated the 6th <lb/>of April 1836, a distinguishing flag to be worn by the <lb/>respective vessels belonging to the Eastern Regatta <lb/>Club of Scotland, viz. a blue cornet flag, with a white <lb/>St Andrew's cross on the upper quarter on a red field.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Heriot's Hospital.</hi> –At the meeting of the <lb/>Governors of George Heriot's Hospital, on Thursday <lb/>the 7th instant, the estimate of Messrs Trotter for <lb/>alterations and repairs on the chapel, amounting to <lb/>t935, was accepted, and it will gratify the friends of <lb/>economy to learn, that this is t65 under the sum <lb/>voted by a majority of the Governors for that purpose <lb/>some time ago. Thereafter a unanimous vote of <lb/>thanks was passed to Councillor Gillespie Graham, <lb/>for gratuitously furnishing a plan of the intended <lb/>improvements on the chapel, which was described by <lb/>Councillor Grant and others, as highly creditable to <lb/>the skill and good taste of that distinguished archi<lb break="no"/>tect. The Governors then proceeded to consider the <lb/>list of applications for admission of boys, preparatory <lb/>to the usual half-yearly election. There were 16 <lb/>vacancies and 37 applicants, who may be thus <lb/>classed :–</p>
                <p>Those who have never received benefit from <lb/>George Heriot's Hospital, or any other insti<lb break="no"/>tution, 12 <lb/>Those who have received benefit for one <lb/>child, 13 <lb/>Do. for two children, 6 <lb/>Do. for three children, 5 <lb/>Do. for five children, 1 <lb/>37</p>
                <p>In considering cases the present practise of the Go<lb break="no"/>vernors is to give preference, first to children of wi<lb break="no"/>dows (being poor), then to those who have never re<lb break="no"/>ceived benefit, afterwards those who have had only <lb/>one child in, and so on. These were but three appli<lb break="no"/>cations for widow's children, and one for an orphan, <lb/>out of the above number, and it is therefore probable, <lb/>considering the large population of Edinburgh, that <lb/>it is not sufficiently known, that George Heriot, in <lb/>his will, expressly points out the <hi rend="italic">fatherless</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">poor</hi>, <lb/>being children of burgesses and freemen, as the ob<lb break="no"/>jects of his charity–hence, if there be not a sufficient <lb/>numbers of really necessitous cases, the Governors, in <lb/>filling up the vacancies, may elect some that do not <lb/>appear to have strong claims, simply from those that <lb/>have such claims not coming forward in sufficient <lb/>numbers. <cb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Political Economy.</hi> –On Thursday last the <lb/>course of lectures on Political Economy, delivered by <lb/>Dr Thomas Murray, in Elder Street Chapel, was <lb/>brought to a conclusion ; on which occasion the thanks <lb/>of the meeting were, on the motion of one of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of committe, voted by acclamation to the lecturer <lb/>for his valuable services. After thanks had been re<lb break="no"/>turned by Dr Murray, Mr A. G. Hunter, merchant, <lb/>was called to the Chair, and some conversation having <lb/>taken place, the committee of management, who had <lb/>necessarily been self-elected, were confirmed by the <lb/>meeting in their office, and empowered to take such <lb/>steps as they might think expedient for obtaining <lb/>lectures to the industrious classes next winter. We <lb/>understand that Dr Murray is to be entertained at <lb/>supper, some evening next week, on the occasion of <lb/>being presented with a piece of silver plate.</p>
                <p>It is with much regret we learn that John Grieve, <lb/>Esq. of Newington Cottage, died on Monday last. <lb/>He was beloved and esteemed for his estimable quali<lb break="no"/>ties by all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance, <lb/>and his death will be long and deeply regretted.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Rare Sights in London.</hi> –A young Scottish Miss, <lb/>who had voyaged the length of London on a pleasure <lb/>jaunt, returned the other day by one of the steamers, <lb/>and was met on landing by various members of her <lb/>family, who anxiously inquired what she had seen <lb/>in London. " Seen !" exclaimed the fair tourist <lb/>"I have seen such <hi rend="italic">sights !</hi>  I saw the <hi rend="italic">Theological </hi>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">The Theatre</hi>.–Mr C. Kean concluded his en<lb break="no"/>gagement on Thursday evening–an engagement <lb/>the longest and most brilliant of any that our <lb/>Theatre has witnessed for many years. Mr Kean <lb/>has been with us for a whole month, and has suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded in crowding the house almost every night. <lb/>We understand that upwards of 30,000 persons have <lb/>visited the theatre during his engagement–a number <lb/>beyond that of any former period of equal duration. <lb/>In that time he has appeared in some of the most <lb/>arduous and difficult of Shakespeare's characters <lb/>Hamlet, Richard, Macbeth, Othello, Shylock, and <lb/>King John, investing each with its own peculiar <lb/>charms and interest, and exciting the highest admira<lb break="no"/>tion and astonishment at the versatility and power of <lb/>his genius, which could give such individuality and <lb/>truth to so many dissimilar, distinct, and separate <lb/>classes of characters. The play with which his en<lb break="no"/>gagement concluded was Richard, which character he has <lb/>performed <hi rend="italic">seven</hi>  times during his engagement ; the house <lb/>was, as usual, crowded in every part, and he exerted <lb/>himself most strenuously and successfully. At the con<lb break="no"/>clusion the cheers of the audience were loud and long, <lb/>and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage <lb/>from different parts of the house. Mr K. being loud<lb break="no"/>ly called for, appeared in front of the stage, and de<lb break="no"/>livered the following very neat and appropriate ad<lb break="no"/>dress:–" <hi rend="italic">Ladies and Gentlemen,</hi> –I now stand before <lb/>you for the last time this season, but believe me <lb/>whichever way my pilgrimage may bend, my thoughts <lb/>will ever recur to Edinburgh as those of a child to <lb/>its distant home, fondly anticipating the hour when <lb/>he shall again stand upon its threshold. (Great cheer<lb break="no"/>ing.) Till that period permit me with a heavy, but a <lb/>grateful heart, to pronounce that melancholy word– <lb/>farewell." (Mr Kean then withdrew amidst reiterated <lb/>and enthusiastic plaudits from all parts of the house.) <lb/>–Mr K. we perceive, appears next in Aberdeen, <lb/>where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his <lb/>performances. The boxes there, we are told, are al<lb break="no"/>ready taken for several successive nights to come.– <lb/>Mrs Honey, from the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, <lb/>makes her appearance here on Monday first.</p>
                <p>On Wednesday evening, Mr John G. Moxey, <lb/>baker, Castle Street, was entertained at supper, in <lb/>Menzie's Hotel and Tavern, Waterloo Place, by a <lb/>party of friends, of about fifty in number, previous to his <lb/>leaving this country for America, to which he is about <lb/>to emigrate. The company was very harmonious, and <lb/>the compliment must have been very gratifying to <lb/>Mr Moxey.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Qualifications of General Assembly Elders.</hi> –The <lb/>Presbytery of Cupar, at their meeting on the 29th ult. <lb/>elected the Earl of Leven and Melville, and Walter <lb/>Malcolm, Esq. Edinburgh, to represent them in the <lb/>ensuing Assembly. Mr Malcolm is factor for Cap<lb break="no"/>tain Hay of Mugdrum, who is principal heritor in <lb/>the parish of Newburgh, and was lately ordained an <lb/>elder there. Against his election to serve in the As<lb break="no"/>sembly a protest and appeal were taken, on the grounds, <lb/>as we understand, that he has no domicile within the <lb/>bounds of Presbytery, and is not an officiating elder; <lb/>the protesters allowing that his election, though con<lb break="no"/>sistent with the letter, is contrary to the spirit of an <lb/>act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal is <lb/>sustained, it is evident that a large proportion of the <lb/>Assembly elders must vacate their seats. Intimation <lb/>also was given by D. Maitland M'Gill, Esq., that <lb/>when the commissions came to be attested, he would <lb/>move for evidence being produced that the elders-elect <lb/>maintain family worship. An amusing inquiry was <lb/>instituted in the Presbytery last year respecting the <lb/>Earl of Leven's habits of domestic devotion ; and a <lb/>clerical member had the candour to say, he should <lb/>wish to know how it was with the ministers themselves <lb/>in that respect.</p>
                <p>The University of St Andrews has just conferred <lb/>the degree of Doctor of Divinity on the Rev. Professor <lb/>Paxton, of Edinburgh. In bestowing this public <lb/>honour on one, who, during a long and useful life, has <lb/>done so much for the cause of literature and religion, <lb/>the members of the College have done an act which <lb/>shows that they can appreciate real merit, and which <lb/>will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious pub<lb break="no"/>lic of Scotland. Those who have had the good for<lb break="no"/>tune to enjoy the public ministrations of Professor <lb/>Paxton, and even the general church-going commu<lb break="no"/>nity, are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence, <lb/>of the pious and heartfelt warmth, and of the classical <lb/>elegance which have long characterised his public <lb/>preaching. Even beyond the religious body of which <lb/>he is the ornament, he is well known as one of the <lb/>most popular and impressive teachers of the day. In <lb/>his lectures on Theology, as Professor to the General <lb/>Associate Synod, and afterwards to the Associate <lb/>Synod, he displayed the results of an extensive and <lb/>profound critical study of the Scriptures, and of an <lb/>unwearied research into the Natural History, and the <lb/>manners and usages of the ancients nations. The <lb/>work by which he is chiefly known as an author– <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">The Illustrations of Scripture</hi> –will long bear testi<lb break="no"/>mony to the extent of his learning, and of his Orien<lb break="no"/>tal investigations, and to his powers of lucid and elo<lb break="no"/>quent composition. We understand that the attention <lb/>of the College was directed to Mr Paxton's merits by <lb/>the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages. <lb/>This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the <lb/>same field of study, reflects high honour on the dis<lb break="no"/>crimination and the heart of Mr Tennant.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Public Dinner to Professor Dick.</hi> –On Tuesday <lb/>last, the Students ofthe Edinburgh Veterinary Col<lb break="no"/>lege and a number of Veterinary Surgeons and other <lb/>gentlemen (in all upwards of 70) from various parts <lb/>of Scotland, entertained Professor Dick to a public <lb/>dinner in the Waterloo Hotel. John Lambert, Esq. <lb/>in the Chair, and Alexander Gordon, jun Esq. crou<lb break="no"/>pier. The stewards were Ed. Pyper, Esq. of West <lb/>Craigs, J. R. Laing, Esq. jun of Dunkenny, Sa<lb break="no"/>muel Wordsworth, jun. Esq. W.S., Dr Malcolm, <lb/>James Miller, Esq. and George Rennie, Esq.– <lb/>Amongst the gentlemen present we observed Professors <lb/>Low and Lizars ; Drs Robertson, Spittal, Knox, and <lb/>Aitken, Mr Ferguson, surgeon ; J. B. Murdoch, <lb/>Esq. of Coldoch; Charles Gordon, Esq. Secretary <lb/>to the Highland Society of Scotland ; A. T. Black<lb break="no"/>wood, Esq. of Oggs Castle ; Mr Dick, senior &amp;c. <lb/>The cloth having been removed and the usual loyal <lb/>toasts drank, the chairman, in a neat and appropriate <lb/>speech, proposed the health of Professor Dick, to <lb/>whom the present meeting had assembled to do ho<lb break="no"/>nour, and who at once commanded their esteem as a <lb/>member of society and their admiration as a man of <lb/>talent, which toast was drank with the greatest en<lb break="no"/>thusiasm. The chairman then proposed his Grace <lb/>the Duke of Gordon and the Highland and Agricul<lb break="no"/>tural Society of Scotland, Patrons of the Edinburgh <lb/>Veterinary College, which was followed by a variety <lb/>of other appropriate toasts. Many excellent songs <lb/>were sung, and the conviviality of the evening was <lb/>kept up until a late hour.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Royal Infirmary</hi> –We understand that the Ste<lb break="no"/>wards of the late Fancy Ball for the benefit of the <lb/>Royal Infirmary have, by their judicious arrange<lb break="no"/>ments in the management of the ball, been enabled to <lb/>pay over to the trustees of that institution, (after de<lb break="no"/>ducting all expenses) the sum of t432, 7s. 8d. The <lb/>managers of the Infirmary, as well as the public at <lb/>large, are certainly much indebted to the gentlemen <lb/>who acted as stewards upon that occasion, for their <lb/>valuable extertions, particularly at the present time, in <lb/>support of this great and useful institution, for the <lb/>relief of those labouring under the united calamities <lb/>of indigence and disease.</p>

The Charles Eaton was supposed to <lb/>have been lost on the Barrier Reef, in Torres Straits, <lb/>in 1833, in prosecution of her voyage from New South <lb/>Wales to Madras, but no precise intelligence of her <lb/>fate was previously known. The ironworks which <lb/>had been erected at Porto Novo were proceeding with <lb/>activity, and some railing had been made there, quite <lb/>equal, it is stated to anything og the kind manufac<lb break="no"/>tured in England.</p>

            </p>
                <p>Our penal settlements appear to be very indifferent<lb break="no"/>ly managed; and we are glad to find that such a man <lb/>as Sir John Franklin is appointed to govern Van Die<lb break="no"/>men's Land; and the sooner an improved system is <lb/>adopted for New South Wales, the better. Not only <lb/>are men sent out to govern who are ignorant of human <lb/>nature, a knowledge of which is essential to the manage<lb break="no"/>ment of the heterogenous materials of our penal colo<lb break="no"/>nies; but when the Government at home opens its eyes <lb/>to any proposal for improvement,it is mismanaged. Our <lb/>rulers have the sense to see the importance of sending <lb/>our respectable females to these colonies ; but they trust <lb/>an Emigration Committee, and this committee trusts <lb/>individuals who desire to make the most of the con<lb break="no"/>cern ; and we are glad to have an opportunity of mak<lb break="no"/>ing the public acquainted with the mode in which <lb/>the business is conducted, in the hope that some hu<lb break="no"/>mane Member of Parliament will take the subject <lb/>up. The mode of managing female emigration is <lb/>this :–</p>
                <p>A temptation, in the first place, is held out of a <lb/>free passage to Australia. A ship is hired, and this <lb/>ship must ave a <hi rend="italic">full</hi>  cargo, to satisfy the <hi rend="italic">owners. </hi>
               <lb/>Advertisements are issued, and instead of hard work<lb break="no"/>ing females, a parcel of decayed governesses, dress<lb break="no"/>makers, &amp;c. &amp;c., with a small mixture of better <lb/>articles, is made up. But if, as almost always hap<lb break="no"/>pens, a sufficient number of these to fill the ship <lb/>does not come forward, a supply of sweepings <lb/>is taken from a workhouse! Here, then, is such a <lb/>mixture of good, bad, and indifferent, to the amount <lb/>of two hundred and upwards, that there is enough <lb/>of evil to corrupt the good. As to the comfort of the <lb/>poor creatures they are crammed <hi rend="smallcaps">four into one </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">bed</hi>  !</p>
                <p>Such is the power of jobbing, that we happen to <lb/>know the fact, that some young women of respectabi<lb break="no"/>lity who wished to go to New South Wales <hi rend="italic">with their </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">friends</hi>, were refused a free passage, unless they went <lb/>to London to go in the Government ship ! Thus we <lb/>see that the interests of agents and shipowners over<lb break="no"/>comes the interests of the colonies, and actually ob<lb break="no"/>structs the attainment of the object in view. We find <lb/>blindness a very common ailment in every department <lb/>of Government ; and however desirous our rulrs may <lb/>be to reform every abuse, and to adopt useful mea<lb break="no"/>sures, they are often thwarted by the necessity (which <lb/>ought not to exist) of conciliating harpies and leeches, <lb/>which devour the public substance, and suck the pub<lb break="no"/>lic blood. Reform has, as yet, only begun to clean <lb/>the outside of the platter ; and it may not reach the <lb/>inside in our day. It is the duty, however, of all pa<lb break="no"/>triots, to sharpen the knife that is to cut out corruption <lb/>from the heart of the commonwealth, by means of ex<lb break="no"/>posure of every abuse that comes to be known, and to <lb/>support those who are willing to apply it.</p>
                <p>As in a matter of so much importance nothing <lb/>should be concealed, there is no hesitation in stating <lb/>that it consists with our knowledge that, after the <lb/>Emigration Committee in Van Diemen's Land, detail<lb break="no"/>ing the deplorable consequences of sending out young <lb/>women from workhouses, a ship has actually sailed, <lb/>nearly filled up as we have described. When any <lb/>representation is made to a public office, the matter is <lb/>said to belong to another department ; and that other <lb/>department says it is not its province to interfere ; and <lb/>thus humanity is made the shuttlecock to the battle<lb break="no"/>dore of jobbing and the blindness of office.</p>
                <p>If our brethren of the press will take up this, the <lb/>inhuman job will be put an end to.</p>

               <lb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Walter</hi>  moved, pursuant to notice, that "an hum<lb break="no"/>ble address be presented to his Majesty, praying that he will <lb/>be graciously pleased to issue his royal orders that a placard <lb/>entitled "Emigration to Van Diemen's Land," which the se<lb break="no"/>veral postmasters throughout the kingdom have been directed <lb/>to put in a conspicuous place in their several post-offices, and <lb/>to circulate among the clergy and the parochial authorities <lb/>be withdrawn." He had been assured y several gentlemen <lb/>who had returned from Van Diemen's land, that many of the <lb/>young females sent out by the Emigration committee had <lb/>been irrevocable consigned to prostitution, and that such as <lb/>obtained services found themselves placed among a very dif<lb break="no"/>ferent calss of persons to that which they had been accustom<lb break="no"/>ed to mix with in this country. The hon. member read an <lb/>extract from a Hobart Town paper, of the 19th of February <lb/>last, in which it was stated that some of the females "thus <lb/>launched into the world," were not more than twelve of thir<lb break="no"/>teen years old.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Wakley</hi>  seconded the motion. <lb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir G. Grey</hi>  adverted to the extraordinary object of the <lb/>address, when the information desired had in fact already <lb/>been given on a former day. He hoped, whatever informa<lb break="no"/>tion, correct or erroneous, might be circulated on the subject <lb/>of emigration, that the people of England would not adopt <lb/>their notions from anonymous paragraphs in Hobart Town <lb/>newspapers. According to the hon. member there was a sys<lb break="no"/>tem in operation by which people were driven out of the <lb/>country–actually turned out of it, as if they were so many <lb/>slaves. Now he could declare that there could be no more <lb/>unfounded statement than this. Though much good had ari<lb break="no"/>sen to the colonies and individuals, yet it could not be denied <lb/>that, in some instances, youn women had turned out badly <lb/>They had these facts upon authority–that many of those fe<lb break="no"/>males obtained respectable places. The names of the indivi<lb break="no"/>duals who obtained them, the dates of their arrival, the <lb/>mode of their meployment, were all to be found int he papers <lb/>on the table of the house. In conclusion, he begged of the <lb/>hon. member and others, when statements relative to emi<lb break="no"/>gration were made, to receive them with caution and reserve.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr C. Lushington</hi>  defended the proceedigs of the Emi<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>gration Committee. he mainted that by their labours the <lb/>greatest posible good had been accomplished, hear, hear.) <lb/>He would then ask of any one to look at the names of the gentle<lb break="no"/>men who were on that committee–to look at their charac<lb break="no"/>ters; and could any one who did so believe that the members <lb/>of that committee would be guilty of the sin of sendng out, <lb/>day after day, young females to the colonies–of thus duping <lb/>those unprotected creatures to their destruction? (hear, hear.)</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Walter</hi>  replied. He had not relied for his state<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ments upon newspapers, but upon official documents.</p>
                <p>The motion was negatived without a division.</p>

                <p>The Colonial Wools offered consisted of 2041 bays. The <lb/>Wools have become much improved in growth, in length of <lb/>staple, in management, and in washing. The market being <lb/>very bare in combining wool, this description realized a propor<lb break="no"/>tionate advance. Several flocks attracted great attention, <lb/>particularly those market T A in a square, I X and Y, <lb/>which show that great pains have been paid by the growers <lb/>upon them. The correct averages obtained are as follows :–</p>

                <p>The frist class of Van Diemen's Land Wool realised a consi<lb break="no"/>derable rise upon last year's sales, the produce of the same <lb/>flocks then selling only at 2s 2d to 2s 5d per lb.</p>
                <p>The Wool Trade is very brisk. The arrivals this week have <lb/>been 2300 bales, of which about 340 are German, 1000 Spa<lb break="no"/>nish, 300 New South Wales, 20 Cape of Good Hope, 50 Tur<lb break="no"/>key, and 500 bales of South American Woo's.</p>

Whatever alteration there may be in the <lb/>yarn market, as compared with recent reports, is for the bet<lb break="no"/>ter. Stocks continue low in the staplers' hands, with very <lb/>little disposition to increase them. Prices remain very steady, <lb/>although the demand for wool is extremely limited. Farmers <lb/>are rather firmer. The Liverpool sales of New South Wales <lb/>Wool went off 1d to 2d per lb. above the recent London sales.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Rochdale, June</hi>  27.–The market this week was very well <lb/>attended, but not so brisk as the last.–Low goods were much <lb/>in demand, and sold well. The trade in Rochdale is generally <lb/>good at present, and building is going on to a very considerale <lb/>extent.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">York Wool Market, June</hi>  30.–The quantity of wool brought <lb/>to this day's market, was not so large as that supplied last <lb/>week, nor was the attendance of buyers so numerous, yet a <lb/>considerable portion of business was done, and last week's <lb/>quotations were fully supported :–good, bred hog 18 1/2d ; half <lb/>hog and ewe, 16 1/2d to 17d ; all ewe, 15d to 15 1/2d ; locks without <lb/>cots 10 1/2 to 11 1/2d ; ditto with cots 11d to 12 1/2d per lb.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">South Australia</hi>
            </p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi>  have received the first annual Report of <lb/>new colony of South Australia, a Parliamentary paper <lb/>presented in June last. The site selected for the <lb/>colony is a part of the south coast of New Holland, <lb/>extending two or three hundred miles on each side of <lb/>Spencer's Gulf, and about 600 miles into the interior. <lb/>It was anticipated that the best central station would <lb/>be Port Lincoln at the entrance of Spencer's Gulf, on <lb/>the west side, or Nepean Bay, on the north coast of <lb/>Kangaroo Isle. Port Lincoln is in latitude 35, and <lb/>east longitude 136, about 700 miles right west from <lb/>Sydney, the same distance north-west from Van Die<lb break="no"/>men's Land, and about 1000 miles eastward of the co<lb break="no"/>lony at King George's Sound. Nepean Bay is about <lb/>100 miles east from Port Lincoln. The colony is <lb/>established under Parliamentary Commissioners, as <lb/>an experiment, we believe, to try whether it may not <lb/>be possible to execute an extensive plan of emigration <lb/>without any charge to the country, by selling lots of <lb/>land at such a price as would defray the expense of <lb/>conveying the emigrants from England. The plan <lb/>adopted is, to send out preferably young married per<lb break="no"/>sons under thirty, and to admit no slaves or convicts <lb/>into the colony. A company has embarked t35,000 <lb/>in the enterprise. A surveying vessel was sent out in <lb/>March to examine the coast carefully, that the <lb/>best site might be chosen at first, and the ne<lb break="no"/>cessity of removal avoided. Six vessels altogether <lb/>had sailed down to the 1st May, carrying out 152 male <lb/>labourers with 37 females, and 26 male and 10 fe<lb break="no"/>males of a superior class. These numbers include 26 <lb/>children. The Commissioners attempted at first to <lb/>get 20s. per acre for the land ; but finding it impos<lb break="no"/>sible, they reduced the price to 12s. By selling at <lb/>this price 437 lots, consisting each of a country sec<lb break="no"/>tion of 134 acres, and a town section of one acre, they <lb/>had raised the t35,000 required by the act of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment as the condition of the grant of land. We give <lb/>these few details to put our readers in a condition to <lb/>understand the notices which appear from time to <lb/>time in the papers respecting the colony. We hope <lb/>the Commissioners or the adventurers will give the <lb/>country a distinctive name. The title of "South <lb/>Australia" is bad any way, and even positively ab<lb break="no"/>surd ; since Australia ( <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi>  Australasia,) originally <lb/>intended for New Holland, has already begun to be <lb/>monopolised by Van Diemen's Land. The district <lb/>at Spencer's Gulf, if it is to participated in the general <lb/>denomination, should be termed "North" rather than <lb/>"South" Australia. By the way, most of our colonies <lb/>in that quarter of the world have ridiculous names, as <lb/>is instantly perceived when we coin a nationa term for <lb/>the people out of them. What can be worse than a <lb/>"Van Diemen-lander ;" a "New South-Wales-ian ;" <lb/>a "Swan River-ite ;" or a "King-George's Sound<lb break="no"/>ian ! !"</p>
