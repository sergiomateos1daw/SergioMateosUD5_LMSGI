               <pb/>Our latest accounts from the West Indies say, <lb/>that no supply from the islands, either of wheat <lb/>or flour, can possibly be obtained from the Ame<lb break="no"/>rican states in consequence of the great bounties <lb/>given by his Most Christian Majesty on these ar<lb break="no"/>ticles. Our charity, therefore, if we have any of <lb/>these articles to spare, must be first extended to <cb/>our own Colonies ; and we cannot be surprised, <lb/>particularly when we consider the present price of <lb/>bread at home, that no assistance can be given at <lb/>present, either to the French or Dutch.</p>
                <p>The crops in the island of Jamaica promise a <lb/>most plentiful harvest, except to the eastward, <lb/>which ahs generally been considered as the most <lb/>productive part.</p>
                <p>By the Westmoreland, just arrived from Ja<lb break="no"/>maica, we learn that the slaves have become mu<lb break="no"/>tinous to an alarming degree, ever since they were <lb/>made acquainted with the intended abolition of <lb/>the Slave Trade.</p>

            </p>
                <p>"We are dreadfully alarmed at present on ac<lb break="no"/>count of the great scarcity of flour throughout <lb/>the province. Common flour sold this morning <lb/>in the market at six dollars, per cwt. bran from <lb/>7s. 6d. to 6s. oats 3s. per bushel, and pease 20d. <lb/>per bushel. There has been an account taken of <lb/>the quantity of flour and wheat in this city, and <lb/>liberties, by order of the Governor and Council, <lb/>and we find there is not more than will serve as <lb/>ten days. They ar much worse off in the district <lb/>of Montreal than we are here: We have sent <lb/>them frequent supplies.</p>
                <p>"Wheat which was found too bad to be ship<lb break="no"/>ped last year at three livres, now sells at two <lb/>dollars. One Merchant will make upwards of <lb/>fifteen hundred pounds by this job.</p>
                <p>"Government, for the relief of the poor, have <lb/>caused to be issued, by the contractor here, rise <lb/>at 3 d. per lb. no one to get more than a dol<lb break="no"/>lar's worth at a time. The day before yesterday <lb/>there was delivered above a hundred pounds worth <lb/>in this way.</p>
                <p>"In consequence of letters by last Thursday's <lb/>post from Montreal, two thousand bushels of da<lb break="no"/>maged wheat were shipped yesterday for that <lb/>market. We have not had a grain of flour from <lb/>England or the States, though we hear of a car<lb break="no"/>go from New York, for Montreal. The vessel <lb/>was to call at New Brunswick ; and it is more <lb/>than probably, that people there, being in great <lb/>want themselves, have detained her. The Go<lb break="no"/>vernment have done now what they should have <lb/>done five or six months ago, and then we should <lb/>not be in this starving condition ; that is, we are <lb/>to have a proclamation to permit the importation <lb/>of grain and flour from the States.</p>
                <p>"My servant is just come home from the ba<lb break="no"/>ker's, where I had sent him for half a dollar's <lb/>worth of bread. After watching for two hours, <lb/>till the bread came out of the overn, he could get <lb/>but eighteen-pennyworth ; three small loaves, <lb/>indeed, weighing only two pounds each. Thir<lb break="no"/>ty-five shillings have been paid for ship biscuit. <lb/>The Lord knows what will become of us–ex<lb break="no"/>cept Government will distribute some of the <lb/>flour that is come for the troops, in the Queen.</p>
                <p>"Mr. Davidson, one of the Council, assured us <lb/>on Thursday last, there was not wheat and flour</p>
                <p>
               <pb/>in the country for five weeks. He has taken a <lb/>great deal of pains to be well informed on the sub<lb break="no"/>juct; and to him are we indebted for the procla<lb break="no"/>mation to allow the importation from the States. <lb/>He stood forth alone, and offered, at his own <lb/>expence, to get an account taken of the quanti<lb break="no"/>ties of wheat and flour in the town and liberties <lb/>of Quebec, and insisted on its being taken into <lb/>consideration."</p>

               <lb/>days ago two bushels of corn, which sold immed<lb break="no"/>diately at 6s. 8d. per bushel; he also brought in <lb/>360 barrels of flour, common and superfine, which <lb/>sold at eight and nine dollars per barrel. No ves<lb break="no"/>sel has arrived here with provisions since Capt. <lb/>George; and no vessel belonging to the island is <lb/>expected to relieve us. A great number of poor <lb/>people have been for ten days past obliged to live <lb/>on the greens of the field. Governor Hamilton, <lb/>by advice of his counsel, has opened the port of <lb/>Bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever, for thirty <lb/>days, to be computed from the 30th day of March, <lb/>laden with bread, corn; or flour. He also allows, <lb/>for three months, the importation of salted pro<lb break="no"/>visions from any foreign port whatever, in vessels <lb/>belonging to these islands. IT is said, what if any <lb/>foreign vessel should come here after the time per<lb break="no"/>mited by proclamation, they will be allowed to <lb/>dispose of their cargo, if they can prove they set <lb/>out with an intent to come here. If any vessels <lb/>be ready to sail from Norfolk, with provisions, ad<lb break="no"/>vise them to call at Bermuda."</p>

               <pb/>THE following extract from a late publica<lb break="no"/>tion, entitled, " A State of the present <lb/>Government of the Province of Quebec," will <lb/>give the public some idea of the Canada Bill, <lb/>which has been so much talked of an procrasti<lb break="no"/>nated so long, and at present pending in Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. The work we understand to be the pro<lb break="no"/>duction of Adam Lymburner, Esq; set over by <lb/>the province to negotiate this afair. It is re<lb break="no"/>markable,withhis former publication, for its strong <lb/>nervous elocution and perspicuity of reasoning.</p>
                <p>"Liberty is congenial to the feelings of all <lb/>mankind. The security which flows from a free <lb/>constitution, to both political and civil liberty, <lb/>contributes greatly towards bringing forth the <lb/>powers of the human mind, and the encourage<lb break="no"/>ment of the industry of people ; but no con<lb break="no"/>stitution can be called free where the people are <lb/>not allowed to participate of the legislative au<lb break="no"/>thority by their representatives : This is the great <lb/>criterion of freedom; and it is extremely natural <lb/>for all British subjects, as they know the value of <lb/>it, to struggle for such a valuable right. Great <lb/>Britain has constantly acknoledged this prin<lb break="no"/> 
               <cb/>ciple in the constitution she has granted to all her <lb/>Colonies; and by that means has rendered them <lb/>more flourishing and prosperous than those of o<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ther nations. Although the inhabitants of the <lb/>province of Quebec have, from the general ten<lb break="no"/>dency of the British government to a mild admi<lb break="no"/>nistration, enjoyed a certain degree of civil liber<lb break="no"/>ty; yet they have been, from the peculiar nature <lb/>of the system of their government, entirely de<lb break="no"/>prived of all political liberty. A more full enjoy<lb break="no"/>ment of these essential privileges has been the <lb/>prayer of their petitions, and of those now be<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>fore the House of commons. The objects prayed <lb/>for may be reduced to the following heads:–</p>
                <p>"1. An elective house of assembly or repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the people. 2. That the members <lb/>of the legislative council receive no salaries as <lb/>counsellors. 3. That the <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> act, and <lb/>the other laws of England relating to personal <lb/>liberty,be made a part of the constitution. 4. That <lb/>trial by jury in civil causes be likewise made part <lb/>of the constitution, and that nine out of twelve <lb/>may return a verdict. 5. That the ancient laws <lb/>and customs of Canada, relative to landed pro<lb break="no"/>perty, marriage settlements, inheritance, and <lb/>dowers, be continued in force in the districts or</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Curious Anecdote</hi>.–A few days ago a stranger <lb/>waited on Mr. Sibbly, Treasurer of the East <lb/>India Company, and desired to speak to him in <lb/>private ; when the were retired, the stranger <lb/>said to Mr. Sibbly, " I am lately returned from <lb/>India, I have smuggled goods to the amount of <lb/>about 120l. What duty have I to pay upon <lb/>them?" Mr. Sibbly smiled, and told him, <lb/>"That he could receive no such money without <lb/>the Chairman's permission." Pray then (said <lb/>the stranger) speak to him of it as soon as possi<lb break="no"/>ble. I am resolved to pay whatever the duty is. <lb/>The Company pays for the exclusive privilege <lb/>of bringing India goods to Europe; the man <lb/>that deprives them of any part of the advantages <lb/>they hope to reap from it, cannot, in my opinion, <lb/>look upon himself as a strictly honest man." <lb/>Since the stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly, the <lb/>Chairman had not had time to give him an an<lb break="no"/>swer ; the stranger notwithstanding, gave him a <lb/>letter, including a Bank note of 30l. The sum <lb/>Mr. Sibbly told him he should pay, if he paid <lb/>any thing.</p>

            </p>
                <p>We left Patia Dec. 15, 1789, and went to <lb/>Decca, and arrived there after a passage of 16 <lb/>days. Just as we arrived there was a famine, <lb/>and it was really a shocking sight to behold; <lb/>you could not move out of your house but the <lb/>corpses lay in your way, and the wild dogs and <lb/>jackalls were eating them at noon-day. The <lb/>Hindoos never bury their dead, but burn them <lb/>to ashes, if they can afford it; if not, throw <lb/>them into the river. I have lately seen a man <lb/>brought to the river side, and laid down at low<lb break="no"/>water mark before he was dead ; and when the <lb/>the tide flowed, it carried him off. If a man, wo<lb break="no"/>man, or child, dies at night, the corpse is eaten <lb/>by the morning. This I have been an eye wit<lb break="no"/>ness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback <lb/>every morning, I had an opportunity of seeing <lb/>more than those that did not. In the course of <lb/>six months I became so much used to it, that I <lb/>took no notice of it.</p>
                <p>"I was there when a dreadful conflagration <lb/>took place, and burnt upwards of seven miles with<lb break="no"/>out intermission, and many souls perished. Now <lb/>consider, first, an inundation; second, a famine; <lb/>and third, a conflagration. How much the place <lb/>must be distressed, I leave you to think. I left <lb/>Decca the 1st of December last, and arrived at <lb/>Calcutta, after a passage through the Sunderburns <lb/>(in 17 days), hearty and well, thank God."</p>

               <pb n="2"/>The old system of sending men of rank to go<lb break="no"/>vern Jamaica, seems to be revived, and laudably <lb/>too.</p>
                <p>This island is the most important possession we <lb/>hold in the West Indies, and is well entitled to <lb/>any mark of distinction which the parent country <lb/>can bestow upon it.</p>
                <p>The salary and emoluments annexed to the <lb/>government of Jamaica, render it the most valua<lb break="no"/>ble of any in the King's gift, except that of Ire<lb break="no"/>land.</p>
                <p>Soon after the Restoration, O'Brian, third <lb/>Earl of Inchiquin, was appointed Governor of <lb/>Jamaica, and died in his Government.</p>
                <p>Henry Bentinck, first Duke of Portland, was <lb/>made Governor of this island in the reign of <lb/>George I. His Grace died at Spanish Town, <lb/>July 4th, 1736, in the 45th year of his age.</p>
                <p>The death of these two Noblemen in their <lb/>government, gave so bad an impression of the cli<lb break="no"/>mate of Jamaica, and the insalubrity of its air, <lb/>that few persons of rank and fortune have been <lb/>ambitious of becoming governors of it, notwith <lb/>standing the brilliancy of the appointments an <lb/>nexd to the situation.</p>

                <p>"I have travelled through several of the States <lb/>and see no appearance of the poverty which you <lb/>hear so much boast of in Britain–every where I <lb/>meet rather with extravagance. Indeed they <lb/>procure too easily to be frugal in their out-givings. <lb/>All the manufactured goods imported from Eu<lb break="no"/>rope are from Britain, and they cannot have goods <lb/>equal in quality and price from any other place.</p>
                <p>"I think I never say so many children as are in <lb/>this country, every town, village, and farm-house, <lb/>are full of them.–The people of this country in<lb break="no"/>crease like rabbits: It is supposed they double <lb/>their numbers every fifteen years; but I should <lb/>think they do it in a shorter period.–What a <lb/>grand prospect for the sale of British goods, for <lb/>when so many hundreds of millions of acres of <lb/>land lye idle to be granted or purchased at a <lb/>small price, the people of this country never will <lb/>manufacture ; At present wages are high, and <lb/>1000 acres of land in the back settlements may <lb/>be purchased for as many <supplied reason="copy blur">pence</supplied>?."</p>

               <hi rend="enlarged-capital">T</hi> HAT no nation can serve the Americans <lb/>with goods equal in quality and price to <lb/>Britain, is wha the whole world knows, and from <lb/>experience the most obstinate rebel American dare <lb/>not deny: It is with pleasure, therefore, we inform <lb/>our readers, that the United States are paying <lb/>more attention to agriculture than to manufac<lb break="no"/>tures–They have already laid out four new <lb/>States since the beginning of their rebellion, viz. <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">Vermont, Kentucky, Indiana,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">The Western Ter<lb break="no"/>ritory.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wil<lb break="no"/>derness; they only began to settle it about the <lb/>year 1774. Kentucky, ten years ago lay in fo<lb break="no"/>rest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid <lb/>has been the population, that there are not less <lb/>than one hundred thousand inhabitants, already, <lb/>in each of these states. The State of Indiana <lb/>was only laid off this present year in 1789, and con<lb break="no"/>tains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From <lb/>a description of these four States, published in <lb/>America in May last, we give our readers a <lb/>short abridged description of the last of them, <lb/>called <hi rend="italic">The Western Territory</hi> ; and it must re<lb break="no"/>rejoice the heart of every Briton to read it, and <lb/>think, that the settling of these countries, though <lb/>the Americans double their numbers every 15 or <lb/>20 years, will long keep them from manufactur<lb break="no"/>ing, and is every day opening a field for new cus<lb break="no"/>tomers to Great Britain; for who will work as a <lb/>tradesman, even though wages are very high, <lb/>when he can, for twenty pounds, purchase a thou<lb break="no"/>sand acres of land, that being the present price <lb/>fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western <lb/>Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufac<lb break="no"/>tures will continually increase with the increasing <lb/>population of America.–Desponding politicians <lb/>may derive comfort from the prospect, that new <lb/>channels of commerce will be opened, and the in<lb break="no"/>land parts of the Continent will require an increas<lb break="no"/>ing supply.–British manufactures will for ages <lb/>ascend the great rivers of that Continent, and by <lb/>means of a most extraordinary inland navigation, <lb/>will be diffused through a country more fertile, <lb/>more extensive, than all the Thirteen United <lb/>States.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Western Territory</hi>
               </hi> 
               <lb/>Is the name given to this new State by Congress. <lb/>It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river <lb/>–north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania? <lb/>south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains, <lb/>according to Mr. Hutchins, Geographer General <lb/>to the Congress, 411,000 square miles, equal to <lb/>two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres, <lb/>from which he deducts forth-three millions of <lb/>acres for water; there will then remain two hun<lb break="no"/>dred and twenty millions of acres belonging to <lb/>the fed–ral government, which is to be sold for <lb/>the discharge of the debt owing to the United <lb/>States. But a very small proportion of these <cb/>lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and <lb/>disposed of by Congress*.</p>
                <p>On the lands which have been purchased by <lb/>Congress from the Indians two settlements are <lb/>already commenced–one at Marietta, the other <lb/>at Miami.</p>
                <p>This State was only laid out by Congress in <lb/>the end of the year 1787, and already contains <lb/>above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are <lb/>the Mississippi, Ohio, Muskingham, Hockhock<lb break="no"/>ing, Sioto, Miami, Wobash,&amp;c–Coal and iron <lb/>mines, and salt pits, abound in this State; the <lb/>soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined, and <lb/>may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little <lb/>or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy, pleasant, <lb/>and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth <lb/>known to the Europeans or Americans–exceed<lb break="no"/>ing the soil of any of the United States. The <lb/>timber is tall, and in great variety?Streams for <lb/>mills abound here. Wheat, indigo, hemp, and <lb/>cotton, thrive well. Many years will probably <lb/>not escape before a good part of the country will <lb/>be brought to that degree of cultivation that will <lb/>exhibit all its latent beauties, and fulfill the de<lb break="no"/>scription of travellers, who call it the <hi rend="italic">garden of </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">the world.</hi>  It is here probably also that the center <lb/>of a great empire will be fixed in some future pe<lb break="no"/>riod. It is the most centrical place for Congress <lb/>to accommodate themselves at. No country is <lb/>better stocked with wild game of every kind; <lb/>herds of deers, elks, bears, &amp;c fill the extensive <lb/>meadows of thie country?turkies, geese, swans, <lb/>and partridges, &amp;c. are innumerable. The rivers <lb/>are excellently stored with fish, and almost all na<lb break="no"/>vigable for small sloops.</p>
                <p>In the ordinance published by Congress for <lb/>the government of this territory, they are to <lb/>be allowed an Assembly when their number a<lb break="no"/>mounts to 30,000 persons; and when they ac<lb break="no"/>quire a certain degree of population they are to <lb/>have representatives in Congress; and when fifty <lb/>millions of acres are settled they are to be divided <lb/>into States.</p>
                <p>Rejoice, O Britons! that they must all be sup<lb break="no"/>plied with manufactures by you, and you <hi rend="italic">only!</hi>
            </p>
                <p>* No more than about twelve millions of acres have <lb/>yet been purchased of the poor natives, for which Con<lb break="no"/>gress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods <lb/>and rum.</p>

               <hi rend="enlarged-capital">O</hi> N Saturday last between three and four <lb/>o'clock, P. M. happened the most violent <lb/>hurricane pest, or thunder storm (for we are at <lb/>a lost to determine its proper name) that was <lb/>ever known in this borough or its vicinity. We <lb/>can conceive of nothing but an earthquake, that <lb/>could be attended with more alarming circum<lb break="no"/>stances. The cloud from the west, or rather a <lb/>number of clouds of a lowering aspect, furiously <lb/>agitated, broken, and seemingly ready to fall– <lb/>attracted the attention, and prepared the mind <lb/>in some measure for what was to follow. The <lb/>lightening appeared to those who were at a dis<lb break="no"/>tance, remarkably red, and seemed to flash from <lb/>the cloud to the earth and back again, in quick <lb/>succession or some time, as to appear one sheet <lb/>of flame. This might have had a great effect on <lb/>the air, at some miles distance from town, to set <lb/>it in rapid motion, especially when pressed down <lb/>by a heavy cloud suddenly falling towards the <lb/>earth. A very considerable quantity of hail fell; <lb/>and the rain was so abundant that it seemed as <lb/>thrown from buckets, and being carried along <lb/>and dashed against every opposing object by a <lb/>most impetuous wind, darkened the air in such a <lb/>manner, that all surrounding objects seemed lost <lb/>in night. The storm threatened to lay the whole <lb/>town in ruins, with such irresistible force did the <lb/>column of air move on: happily however, the da<lb break="no"/>mages were much less than apprehended. The <lb/>The new brick house belonging to the Rev. Dr. Da<lb break="no"/>vidson, being an an elevated spot near the west <lb/>end of the town, and lying directly in the line of <lb/>march of this powerful column, was the first suf<lb break="no"/>ferer; all the parts of the building above the square <lb/>were suddenly borne off, and a great part of the <lb/>roof was carried over Mr. Paton's house, which <lb/>stood at a small distance on the east, striking it <lb/>forcibly, and injuring it greatly in its ways, and <lb/>fell on the adjoining lot. Mr. Paton's house is <lb/>left in much the same condition as the Doctor's. <lb/>After injruing some smaller buildings in its course <lb/>to the eastward, the next elevated object to which <lb/>it pointed its fury, was the presbyterian church <lb/>in the certain of town–a building of uncom<lb break="no"/>mon solidity, calculated, it was thought, to stand <lb/>for ages, admist all the war of the elements. A<lb break="no"/>bout a fourth part, however of the roof of the <lb/>north side was carried off, with the weighty cor<lb break="no"/>nice, and thrown to the ground at some hundred <lb/>yards distance on the east side of the open square <lb/>which is in the centre of this borough. After <lb/>leaving the town it beat its course to the public <lb/>buildings, and greatly injured that range nearest <lb/>the town. Many fences in the neighbourhood, <lb/>which were in the line of its direction, were also <lb/>thrown down; but how far it extended, or what <lb/>damages the farmers may have sustained we have <lb/>not yet learned. Let it, however, not be forgot<lb break="no"/>ten, that dreadful as the scene was, through the <lb/>good providence of God, not a single life was <lb/>lost or any personal injury, worth mentioning, <cb/>received, and the buildings, it is hoped, will soon <lb/>be restored to as good a state as they were in be<lb break="no"/>fore.</p>

                <p>We are happy in informing our readers, that <lb/>in the memory of the oldest man among us a <lb/>more plentiful year has not been known than the <lb/>present. Neither mildew nor fly has affected the <lb/>wheat; the grain is heavy, and full, and in large <lb/>quantities. The other grains are likewise plen<lb break="no"/>tiful, and of an excellent quality. Such distin<lb break="no"/>guished favours call for the gratitude of the in<lb break="no"/>habitants of the United Sates, to the great Au<lb break="no"/>thor of Nature; especially when these blessings of <lb/>nature are connected in the same year with deli<lb break="no"/>verance from anarchy, and with the establishment <lb/>of a wise, free, and just government.</p>

               <pb n="2"/>We have been favoured by a friend with the <lb/>following extract of a letter from Grenada, by <lb/>the last West India Packet.</p>
                <p>"A Mr. C– has just arrive here from <lb/>Martinico, where he left the white inhabitants in <lb/>arms. The negroes there had conceived an idea, <lb/>that the Parliament of England had set the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish negroes free ; where upon those on several of <lb/>the most considerable estates assembled together <lb/>to the amount of 4000, and retired to the moun<lb break="no"/>tains, declaring, they would no longer be slaves ; <lb/>saying, that they had as good a right to be free, <lb/>as the negroes in the English islands. What has <lb/>been the event is unknown ; but some reports say <lb/>that they had arms, and had resisted the military <lb/>and the militia ; and that 400 had been taken <lb/>and condemned to die. It is a little singular that <lb/>such an alarming spirit of discontent should first <lb/>make its appearance among the French negroes, <lb/>if they are (as has been assented by several writers) <lb/>so much more civilized, so much better treated, <lb/>than those of the English islands. God knows <lb/>what bloodshed may soon follow, from the mis<lb break="no"/>taken humanity of some well meaning, but ill <lb/>informed leaders among you."</p>

                <p>"It is with great concern I communicate to <lb/>you the following truly melancholy intelligence: <lb/>–About three weeks ago, Mr. Richard Cheno<lb break="no"/>weth, had six or eight men allowed him, by the <lb/>officer of the garrison at the Falls, to guard his <lb/>exposed plantation, in Bear Crab Settlement, be<lb break="no"/>low the Falls. In the evening of their arrival, <lb/>before they had taken their station as a guard, <lb/>a number of Indians rushed into Mr. Chenoweth's <lb/>house, killed two of the soldiers, and three of Mr. <lb/>Chenoweth's children, and tomahawked and scalp<lb break="no"/>ed his wife, leaving her on the floor for dead– <lb/>Mr. Chenoweth, (who had his arm broke by the <lb/>savages) with the rest of the men, made their <lb/>escape.–There was one of Mr. Chenoweth's <lb/>children sick, in a chamber, and, it is reported, <lb/>she never heard any thing of the dreadful massacre; <lb/>but, next morning, crawling down stairs, she was <lb/>inexpressibly shocked at the sight of a beloved pa<lb break="no"/>rent almost breathless–Mr. Chenoweth returned <lb/>next day to his house, and carried his wife to a <lb/>neighbouring plantation, where they are both <lb/>likely to recover, and, what is remarkable, she <lb/>wants to return to her own house.–The savages <lb/>have been very troublesome in this neighbourhood. <lb/>–A small company are gone to White River, to <lb/>extirpate 80 or 90 Indians, who, as spies have in<lb break="no"/>formed, have upwards of 300 horses, &amp;c. at that <lb/>place."</p>

                <p>That the present Revolution in France is a con<lb break="no"/>sequence of the Revolution in America, cannot <lb/>admit of a doubt. The American Revolution o<lb break="no"/>riginated in Adams, a very insignificant Bosto<lb break="no"/>nian. Not that this Adams had the least expec<lb break="no"/>tation of American independence, when he fo<lb break="no"/>mented the opposition to the stamp-act; indeed <lb/>no human wisdom could possibly have foreseen <lb/>the subsequent folly and imprudence of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish administration and its obsequious Parliament. <lb/>An Administration so totally destitute of common <lb/>sense, so totally ignorant of every princple of <lb/>sound policy, no nation ever beheld. Adams had <lb/>the sagacity to avail himself of such despicable <cb/>policies.–Fortunately for the American cause, <lb/>the Generals that were sent from England were <lb/>of congenial abilities with the Minister, and the <lb/>Americans themselves were surprised at the faci<lb break="no"/>lity with which they acquired their independence. <lb/>–Yet all the blunders of the British administra<lb break="no"/>tion, and the miserable conduct of the British <lb/>Generals, would hardly have been sufficient to <lb/>emancipate America, notwithstanding her ex<lb break="no"/>treme weakeness, without the assistance of France; <lb/>and this assistance depended entirely on Dr. <lb/>Franklin being driven to Paris by the fatal-phi<lb break="no"/>lippic of a certain great lawyer. Such, therefore, <lb/>is the chain of concurrent circumstances that hath <lb/>overturned the French monarch. If the British <lb/>minister had possessed common sagacity–if he <lb/>could have distinguished a general from a corpo<lb break="no"/>ral; if Franklin had been treated with common <lb/>civility, America would have remained a British <lb/>colony, and France an absolute monarch, for <lb/>ages yet to come.</p>

               <pb n="6"/>Mr. Ephraim Daniel, of Baker's-row, Mile<lb break="no"/>end, received the following letter from a friend <lb/>in Holland last week:</p>
                <p>"Sir, your friend L–y, who is just come here <lb/>from the East Indies, desires me to inform you, <lb/>that your unfortunate relation who left you with <lb/>the transports for Botany Bay, was well in Fe<lb break="no"/>bruary last. He has settled at Port Jackson, and <lb/>has leave to teach the children of some of your <lb/>nation to read and write in your own way. The <lb/>place is much improved since you ahve had any <lb/>letters form it, as there was no person without a <lb/>habitation, and being in some order, when he <lb/>left it. Except wearing apparel, very little is <lb/>wanting but business ; but you may thank the <lb/>Dutch at Batavia for it, as they have brought <lb/>several useful things there. The last crops of <lb/>corn, and the garden grounds, were in very good <lb/>condition : and what makes the settlement more <lb/>convenient, one of the people who came in the <lb/>first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for use <lb/>and ornament, as the clay is equally good as that <lb/>of Delft or elsewhere. He was surprised to see <lb/>so many people without hats or shoes, and houses <lb/>without windows, and full of wicker and rush <lb/>furniture, which is used in the place of almost <lb/>every thing else. If the smiths had a plentiful <lb/>supply of coal and iron, hardly any utensils would <lb/>be wanting. Your nephew has two children, and <lb/>says all that are born there are very healthy, and <lb/>more born than are buried or executed of grown <lb/>people. The Christians Church was quite finish<lb break="no"/>ed before he came away ; and he thinks if there <lb/>were enough of your people, they might have a <lb/>place to themselves. The farthest of the lines <lb/>was seldom visited by the savages ; and it was <lb/>reported when he came away, that as soon as <lb/>more troops and a new Governor comes over, <lb/>they would go farther than ever up the country, <lb/>when some valuable discovers are expected to be <lb/>made ; they have a gum which may be used for <lb/>gum arabic, which is veyr useful. He ex<lb break="no"/>pects several of your people will go from Batavia <lb/>to settle there very soon ; and wonders a way <lb/>for sending old clothes is not yet found out. <lb/>Norfolk Island is os thinly inhabited, that it is not <lb/>worth a stranger's while to land there ; and as lit<lb break="no"/>tle is said about it there, as if it was as far off as <lb/>Europe, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

               <pb n="6"/> The West India merchants, who were in the <lb/>utmost anxiety for the arrival of the packet from <lb/>the West Indies, have been most agreebly relie<lb break="no"/>ed from their apprehensions. The account of the <lb/>insurrections in Martinique, which we received <lb/>through France, and which has been since con<lb break="no"/>firmed in the National Assembly, naturally alarm<lb break="no"/>ed them for the British islands. We are happy <lb/>to inform our readers, that the packet brings no <lb/>intelligence whatever of tumult of insurrections. <lb/>We have not heard even that the letters bring <lb/>any account of the conspiracy in Martinique ; a <lb/>circumstance which can only be accounted for by <lb/>the little communication which exists between the <lb/>islands at this season of the year."</p>

            </p>
                <p>"This day week the most diabolical design that <lb/>that ever was formed, was discovered in Martinico : It <lb/>was an insurrection of the negroes, who were that <lb/>night to have set fire to the large and beautiful <lb/>town of St. Pierre ; while the white people were <lb/>all in confusion, and striving to escape the flames, <lb/>they were to be butchered indiscriminately, man <lb/>woman, and child.–The combustibles were laid <lb/>in upwards of 100 houses, consisting of hemp dip<lb break="no"/>ped in turpentine. The plot was not discovered <lb/>till five o'clock in the evening, when a negro be<lb break="no"/>longing to an old lady, stung with remorse on <lb/>thinking that he must murder the woman who <lb/>brought him up form a child, disclosed it to her. <lb/>The Troops being thereupon assembled, 40 of the <lb/>negroes were taken, armed with a hanger and a <lb/>long knife, the insturments which were in a few <lb/>hours to have put a period to the existence of up<lb break="no"/>wards of 5000 people. All the inhabitants have <lb/>been under arms ever since, as they are afraid the <lb/>negroes will attemp to release the 40 who are in <lb/>gaol."</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">To the PRINTER</hi>.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir,</hi>
            </p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">ABOUT</hi>  two month ago I went to the coun<lb break="no"/>try to pay a visit to a friend in a remote <lb/>county; and though I am much of what may be called "a <hi rend="italic">newspaper man</hi>," I never thought of or<lb break="no"/>dering my papers to be sent down to me. To <lb/>my utter astonishment, my <hi rend="italic">rustic</hi>  landlord did <lb/>not take in own newspaper; so there was I, stuck <lb/>down, with my friend in the country–knowing <lb/>no more of what passed in town than if I had <lb/>been in <hi rend="italic">Lapland</hi>. Intending every day should be <lb/>my last, I went on without ordering your, or any <lb/>other paper, till two months had passed away, at <lb/>which period I returned to town. And there, <lb/>Sir, I was quite a new man, and just as if I had <lb/>dropped down from the clouds. Every day I <lb/>heard people talking of occurrences of which I <lb/>knew nothing : Revolutions in France by <hi rend="italic">Fish<lb break="no"/>women</hi>  ; and battles in Flanders, against the <lb/>Emperor, who I thought was fighting against <lb/>the Turks.</p>
                <p>But even this was not the most distressing–for <lb/>one day meeting a friend, I inquired very cor<lb break="no"/>dially after his wife, who I found a few days af<lb break="no"/>terwards, had eloped just before with another <lb/>gentleman ; and meeting with a lady, I inquir<lb break="no"/>ed kindly for her sister, who I found had depart<lb break="no"/>ed to the other world a fortnight before.</p>
                <p>On this account I never will stir again "out of <lb/>the world" unless your paper goes along with me. I <lb/>hold a newspaper to be a kind of <hi rend="italic">viaticum</hi>  with <lb/>which every man should be provided, and which be<lb break="no"/>come the more necessary the further we remove <lb/>from town It. is the only way to keep pace with <lb/>what is going on every day in the fashionable or <lb/>literary world–and to prevent talking about dead <lb/>friends, or wives that have absconded.</p>
                <p>In short, Sir, a newspaper is my <hi rend="italic">creed</hi> –and ne<lb break="no"/>ver will I again travel without my faith along with <lb/>me : having fully experienced the unpleasantness <lb/>of being sent back into the world as ignorant as <lb/>if I had been born again– <hi rend="italic">I hereby give notice</hi> – <lb/>"That if an <hi rend="italic">hottentot</hi>  friend of mine invites me, <lb/>who does not take in your paper or some other– <lb/>I will not visit him." <hi rend="smallcaps">DICK DESPERATE</hi>.</p>

               <hi rend="enlarged-capital">I</hi> N the United States of America there are some <lb/>Jews, and various denomications of Christians, <lb/>–as Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, <lb/>Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers, Dunkers, <lb/>Moravians, Deists, Methodists, Newlights, San<lb break="no"/>dimanians, Universalists, and Shaking Quakers; <lb/>all of whom are allowed to perform religious wor<lb break="no"/>ship accoridng to the dictates of their consciences.</p>
                <p>The Shaking Quakers are a new sects, that <lb/>sprang up about the year 1769 : an old woman <lb/>called the Elect Lady, with twelve disciples, all <lb/>of which were said to be Europeans, were the <lb/>founders of this new mode of worship ; they drew <lb/>thousands of people after them, who pretended <lb/>they were visited with power from on high to <lb/>work miracles, heal the sick, raise the dead, cast <lb/>out devils, and speak in unknown languages.</p>
                <p>This Lady risided in the north-westerly part <lb/>of the State of New York, where she began to <lb/>instil her tenets into some of the people there:– <lb/>afterwards she rambled from place to place, pro<lb break="no"/>mulgating her religion, and gaining proselytes in <lb/>New England, and elsewhere:–she engrossed the <lb/>kingdom of heaven to herself and followers, to <lb/>the seculsion of all others.</p>
                <p>She pretended her mission was immediately from <lb/>heaven;–that she travelled in pain for her elect, <lb/>–could speak in seventry-two unknown languages, <lb/>in which she conversed with those that had de<lb break="no"/>parted this life,–that there had not been a true <lb/>church upon earth since the days of the Apostles, <lb/>until her's was erected,–that both the living and <lb/>the dead must be saved, in, by, and through her <lb/>–must confess their sins unto her, and procure <lb/>her parson, or they could not be saved;–that <lb/>that she gathered her church from both earth and <lb/>hell, as every person that had died since the time <lb/>of the Apostles, until her church was set up, was <lb/>damned, and that they were ocntinually making <lb/>intercession to her for salvation, which was the <lb/>occasion of her talking to them in those unknown <lb/>tongues.</p>
                <p>Those that entered into her church were ob<lb break="no"/>liged to confess their sins, and deliver up their <lb/>jewels, rings, necklaces, buckles, watches, &amp;c. to <lb/>be disposed of as she thought fit.</p>
                <p>It has been reported that some of these confes<lb break="no"/>sions proved very beneficial; for some of her <lb/>church members owned they had stolen things that <lb/>had been laid to innocent persons.</p>
                <p>When these people carry on their worship, they <lb/>pretend to praise the Lord by singing, dancing, <lb/>jumping, turning round, falling down, tumbling, <lb/>&amp;c. and in the mean time some will be trembling, <lb/>groaning, sighing, and sobbing: whilst others are <lb/>preaching, praying, exhorting, &amp;c. others will be <lb/>clapping their hands, shouting, hallowing, scream<lb break="no"/>ing, and making such a hideous noise, that it <lb/>may be heard at a great distance, and will often <lb/>affrighten the spectators.</p>
                <p>They often dance three hours without inter<lb break="no"/>mission, and when any of them are tired of prais<lb break="no"/>ing the Lord that way, they are whipped by o<lb break="no"/>thers, to make the worship go on briskly. <cb/>They dance till they are much emaciated ; the <lb/>young women grow pale, appear like ghosts or <lb/>apparitions, or like deserters from a church-yard, <lb/>–if I may use the sailor's phrase.</p>
                <p>They make no use of the Eucharist, or of wa<lb break="no"/>ter baptism in their churchs; are averse to wars, <lb/>fighting, and swearing ; they use the plain lan<lb break="no"/>guage, and cry– <hi rend="italic">yea</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">nay</hi>, instead of <hi rend="italic">yes</hi>  and <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">no</hi> : but the other Quakers do not approve of all <lb/>their tenets.</p>
                <p>At particular times they labour very hard at <lb/>their respective occupations, and are very careful <lb/>that no time is spent in idleness.</p>
                <p>They pretend they hold a correspondence with <lb/>the saints and angels, and that they frequently <lb/>see and converse with the spirits of their departed <lb/>friends.</p>
                <p>Many of them refuse to be with their wives, <lb/>because they suppose they are part of the hundred <lb/>and forty and four thousand mentioned in the <lb/>Revelations that were redeemed from the earth, <lb/>and were not defiled with women.</p>
                <p>They hold, that they have already been made <lb/>partakers of the first resurrection, and that on <lb/>them the second death will have no power.</p>
                <p>They do not allows the instrumental music in <lb/>their churches, because they suppose it was cere<lb break="no"/>monial, and is abolished;–but pretend that they <lb/>carry on their worship by the immediate power <lb/>and influence of the Holy Ghost, and that they <lb/>have scripture warrents for their practice, a[?]– <lb/>Sing unto God,–Praise the Lord in the dance; <lb/>–O clap your hands, all ye people;–Shout on <lb/>to God;–Make a joyful noise;–Fall down be<lb break="no"/>fore the Lords,&amp;c.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Martinique</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Oct</hi>. 6.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>The disturbances in this island are so far from <lb/>having abated, that they seem daily to gain ad<lb break="no"/>ditional force. The French General, after the <lb/>and endeavoured to bring over a part of the mi<lb break="no"/>litary to his side, against the people : He began <lb/>with subalterns, several of whom took a cer<lb break="no"/>tain oath of attachment which he administered to <lb/>them ; but when he came to the Major, that of<lb break="no"/>ficer declined, saying he had already engaged <lb/>himself on the <hi rend="italic">side of the people</hi>. Incensed at this <lb/>reply, he reviled him in very opprobrious terms, <lb/>and at last laid his cane upon him !</p>
                <p>Frustrated in his attempts upon the infantry, <lb/>he made his next application to the regiment of <lb/>artillery, but with as little success. They inform<lb break="no"/>ed him, that themselves and Culverins were sta<lb break="no"/>tioned there for the protection of the <hi rend="italic">people</hi>, and <lb/>for <hi rend="italic">them</hi>  only should be used.</p>
                <p>Driven to the last shift, his distress suggested <lb/>the sorry expedient of having recourse to the <hi rend="italic">peo<lb break="no"/>ple</hi>  of <hi rend="italic">colour</hi>, who <hi rend="italic">here</hi>  form a considerable corps. <lb/>By a small dose of flattery these people, so rea<lb break="no"/>dily to be caught by a little seeming attention, <lb/>promised to stand by him ; and did so, as long <lb/>as they usually stand firm to any thing–that is, till <lb/>their fears for their own persons became an ob<lb break="no"/>ject of more weighty concern–they then aban<lb break="no"/>doned him.</p>
                <p>The humiliating familiarities to which he de<lb break="no"/>scended to this motley rabble, were truly disgust<lb break="no"/>ing. He embraced them; called them his <hi rend="italic">enfans </hi>
               <lb/>and <hi rend="italic">cher amis</hi>, and practised all the dirty conde<lb break="no"/>scensions, which those only who are conversant in <lb/>the praise-worthy art of cajoling, can form any <lb/>conception of.</p>
                <p>The effect of this conduct was, as might be ex<lb break="no"/>pected, insolence–one of this banditti presumed <lb/>to strike a grenadier–this incensed both the mi<lb break="no"/>litary and the peopl–the consequence was, their <lb/>doughty leader was laid hold of, when his trusty <lb/>defenders left him to his fate. He wa sput into <lb/>confinement, and had the pleasure of beholding <lb/>from the windows of his prison, him whom he had <lb/>inspired with the insolent temerity to strike <lb/>White, suspended on a gibbet.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of St. Pierre then assembled <lb/>to confer on the measures to be taken on this oc<lb break="no"/>casion, when ten deputies were chosen to bring <lb/>the deposed Commander to that part of the island <lb/>for trial, and twelve Judges were chosen to pre<lb break="no"/>side at that very important tribunal.</p>
                <p>Thus stood matters on Thursday last, at which <lb/>time a rumour prevailed that the Marquis de <lb/>Bouillee had suffered death by the extraordinary <lb/>and ingenious method of being put between two <lb/>planks and severed in pieces by a cross-cut saw.</p>

            </p>
                <p>"Congress is still sitting at New York, and <lb/>from the multiplicity of business before them, <lb/>there is no likelihood of the session's soon closing. <lb/>We are curious to know what foreigners will say</p>
                <p>
               <pb/>of our new commercial arrangements. Among <lb/>ourselves there is but one opinion, and that is fa<lb break="no"/>avourable. o our own vessels, a preference is <lb/>undoubtedly due; and among foreign vessels and <lb/>merchandise, there is no discrimination in our <lb/>import and tonnage acts, every nation being on <lb/>the same footing. With respect to the duties <lb/>themselves, they could not be laid lower, consi<lb break="no"/>dering the demand of supplies, which the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee appointed to give in an estimate state at <lb/>upwards of eight millions of dollars.</p>
                <p>"Accustomed to disappointment in hopes of <lb/>improvement in politics and commerce, we <lb/>feel a reluctance to entertaining very sanguine <lb/>wishes. Yet appearances encourage the expect<lb break="no"/>tion of the f–deral government's acting with the <lb/>energy and effect that will give it respectability. <lb/>The prejudices and animosities created by the <lb/>late contest are gradually dying away ; and to <lb/>the idleness and dissipation flowing from the same <lb/>source, industry has in a great degree succeeded. <lb/>A progress has also been made in manufactures <lb/>of various kinds that was not expected ; and the <lb/>persevering in them affords a strong presumption <lb/>of those concerned deriving advantage.</p>
                <p>"Throughout the union, the public opinion <lb/>on matters of government has of late experien<lb break="no"/>ced rapid changes. Vice President Adams, in <lb/>his highly esteemed work, has fully demonstrated <lb/>the absurdity of democracy, and the superior ex<lb break="no"/>cellence of a mix form, such as that of Britain. <lb/>His deductions from premises admitted as just, <lb/>have abated much of the popular aversion to mo<lb break="no"/>narchy ; and as every thing matures quickly in <lb/>our transatlantic soil, it would not surprise many, <lb/>were United America to have a sovereign ear<lb break="no"/>in the next century.</p>
                <p>"In no one instance has our new admnistra<lb break="no"/>tion given general satisfaction, more than in their <lb/>conduct towards the Indians. The interests of <lb/>those unfortunate people will be studiously attend<lb break="no"/>ed to ; and they will be effectually protected a<lb break="no"/>gainst the lawless violence of the individuals or <lb/>States, who wished to wrest their lands from them. <lb/>This determination is dictated by policy as well <lb/>humanity ; for it is now become the interest of <lb/>the States to check, by every means short of <lb/>violence, the erratic disposition of their citizens, <lb/>who, when removed to the wilds beyond the <lb/>mountains, cannot be regarded as of any value, <lb/>in a political view.</p>

               <pb/>Governor Philips describes Port Jackson, which <lb/>is only about nine miles to the Northward of <lb/>Botany Bay in South Wales, on the Coast of <lb/>Holland, as one of the finest harbours in the <lb/>world, in which 1000 sail of the line might ride <lb/>in perfect security. Sydney cove, named so in <lb/>honour of Lord Sydney, the Governor chose in <lb/>preference, which is about hal a mile in length, <lb/>and a quarter of a mile across at the entrance. <lb/>Here was the finest spring water, and ships can <lb/>anchor so close in short, that at a very small expence <lb/>quays may be constructed, at which the largest <lb/>vessels may constantly unload. His meeting with <lb/>the natives here was friendly and uninterrupted. <lb/>The appearance of the place was picturesque and <lb/>pleasing, and it afforded an ample harvest for <lb/>botanical acquisitions.</p>

               <pb/>The Minister is now said to be employed in <lb/>drawing up two plans, which will give rise to <lb/>very warm debates in Parliament : one is for set<lb break="no"/>tling a commercial arrangement between Great <lb/>Britain and Ireland ; the other for giving a con<lb break="no"/>stitution to Canada. In feeling the former, the <lb/>Minister will have to contend with strong com<lb break="no"/>mercial prejudices; in the latter, he will have to <lb/>encounter religious principles. The British <lb/>settlers in Canada are comparatively few in num<lb break="no"/>ber. The great bulk of the Canadians are the <lb/>descendants of French, and are Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lics. The former are Protestants.</p>
                <p>Fleaury in france, and Walpole in England, <lb/>were not fonder of peace than Mr. Pitt. Con<lb break="no"/>quests may be made by war, but consequence and <lb/>wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system, <lb/>if the first commercial nation in the world.</p>
                <p>Besides these considerations, the grand secret <lb/>has been discovered since the present Minister <lb/>came into power, that the best riddance England <lb/>ever had, was of her American Colonies ; because <lb/>by this means, she becomes thoroughly collected <lb/>at home, to oppose every foreign power, without <lb/>the expence and blood of supporting the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans, at the same time that they cannot do with<lb break="no"/>out BRitish manufactures in one line or another.</p>
                <p>Thus, they are under the necessity of protect<lb break="no"/>ing themselves, at the same time, that, like the <lb/>rest of Europe, they are obliged to resort to our <lb/>superior mercantile market.</p>
                <p>Application has been lately made to the Lords <lb/>of the Treasury for an order on the Bank to issue <lb/>some of the new silver coin, in aid of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent want of silver for circulation, the scarcity <lb/>of which is much felt by retail traders in par<lb break="no"/>ticular.</p>

               <pb/>Letters from Jamaica say, that by vessels arri<lb break="no"/>ved there from Hispaniola, there are advices that <lb/>the French inhabitants of that island feel, with <lb/>unabating energy, the glorious cause in which <lb/>their patriotic countrymen in Old France are em<lb break="no"/>barked. Men of every class and description wear <lb/>the national cockade of blue and white. Their <lb/>accounts from France, similar in date and sub<lb break="no"/>stance to ours, have filled them with the most <lb/>lively hopes, and animated them with a spirit of <lb/>resistance to the measures of their Government, <lb/>as forcible as it was unexpected by those entrust<lb break="no"/>ed with the executive power. At Port au Prince <lb/>both the Governor and Intendant have rendered <lb/>themselves completely odious, by vain attempts <lb/>to counteract an impulse that is irresistible. The <lb/>effigy of Mons. Marbois, the latter, has been <lb/>hung and burnt; the people loudly insist that <lb/>both shall immediately quit the colony, and their <lb/>departure is hourly expected. The press, hither<lb break="no"/>to under the severest restraint, triumphs in its free<lb break="no"/>dom; and their weekly publications give an ac<lb break="no"/>count of the proceedings of the States General <lb/>without the smallest reserve.</p>

               <pb/>The following philosophical facts lead us to <lb/>presume that the winter now setting in, will prove <lb/>a mild one : It has been constantly remarked, that <lb/>when this season commences early, and with se<lb break="no"/>verity, in Newfoundland, and the more northern <lb/>part of North America, it becomes extremely ri<lb break="no"/>gorous, and of a proportionate continuance there. <lb/>When, in the above climate, the winters have <lb/>been severe, they have invariably been mild with <lb/>us, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>. Now, the ships which sailed <lb/>from Newfoundland the beginning of October <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">last</hi>, saw the hills already covered with snow. <lb/>There is still another argument in favour of a mild <lb/>winter with us. Previously to the setting in of a <lb/>severe one, nature, in her bounty, has been always <lb/>observed to have provided an uncommon store of <lb/>wild briar fruits, as a nourishment to the smaller <lb/>birds, who would otherwise perish, a vast carpet <lb/>of snow spreading itself over the ground, so as to <lb/>prevent their coming at the worms, &amp;c. on which <lb/>they are accustomed to feed. The present sea<lb break="no"/>son, the store of these wild fruits is extremely mo<lb break="no"/>derate.</p>

               <pb/>By letters from America, dated the 5th ult. <lb/>we learn, that wheat is so great a crop all over the <lb/>Provinces, that it has fallen at Virginia to [?] a <lb/>bushel. At Philadelphia it is 7s. 6d. paper cur<lb break="no"/>rency, about 3s. 8d. Sterling per bushel;–which <lb/>has reduced the price in France in from 48s. to <lb/>42s. 2d. and it is 20s. per quarter lower in Hol<lb break="no"/>land than it was four months ago.</p>
                <p>Two ships, laden with American wheat, have <lb/>already arrived at Bristol, where the cargoes were <lb/>immediately purchased by the dealers. Large <lb/>orders are sent to America for wheat, of which <lb/>there has been a prodigious crop.</p>

                <p>"The convicts already arrived at this port <lb/>from Newfoundland, are near fourscore in num<lb break="no"/>ber; a few others are expected. These unhap<lb break="no"/>py wretches are almost destitute of every sort of <lb/>covering, and some of them are labouring under <lb/>sickness and infirmity. Their story is accurate<lb break="no"/>as follows: About the middle of last June, <lb/>this miserable class of beings, to the amount of <lb/>102 men and boys, and twelve women, all of <lb/>whom were convicts, were embarked at Dublin, <lb/>on board the Duke of Leinster transport, the <lb/>owners of which, who are Dublin merchants, <lb/>contracted with the Government of Ireland for <lb/>carrying the convicts to the North American <lb/>States.</p>
                <p>"After the ship had been at sea five weeks, <lb/>part of which was foul weather, the provision is <lb/>said to have fallen short ; the master of the trans<lb break="no"/>port, Capt. Harrison, accordingly stood in for <lb/>Newfoundland and lay-to till night; when he <lb/>disembarked at Bull's Bay, and a little distance <lb/>from it, with as much secrecy as possible, his des<lb break="no"/>perate freight.</p>
                <p>"To prevent this proceeding being too early <lb/>early known, he landed with them provision for the <lb/>immediate supply of their wants, and bore away <lb/>with a press of sail. The hungry victims lived <lb/>for three days in a state of warfare, quarrelling <lb/>about their food ; the strongest beat the weak, <lb/>and over a cask of rank butter or beef, there <lb/>was for a time as severe fighting as if a kingdom <lb/>had been at stake.</p>
                <p>"They reached the town of St. John's on <lb/>the 20th of July ; and exhibited the most appal<lb break="no"/>ing procession ever seen in that country : the in<lb break="no"/>habitants had immediate councils; and the mili<lb break="no"/>tary and navy co-operating, a place of security <lb/>was fixed upon at a distance from the town, and <lb/>they were lodged ; here under a guard.</p>
                <p>"Here the Irish howl was nightly sung in full <lb/>chorus, and the centinels were frequently fright<lb break="no"/>ed with the noise while on their posts. A battle <lb/>or two every half hour kept them festive all day; <lb/>and when the provision supplied to them by the <lb/>inhabitants was lessening, they broke away, and <lb/>laid hold of every thing that was eatable, with<lb break="no"/>out enquiring whether it had an owner.</p>
                <p>"Some of these poor wretches were anxious <lb/>to be received into the service of the inhabitants <lb/>and probably might have reformed, if so fostered. <lb/>But all of them have a claim to the charity of <lb/>this country for that supply of raiment which is <lb/>necessary to guard them against the inclement <lb/>weather."</p>

                <p>
               <pb n="6"/>"From some late communications it is evident, <lb/>that as much sugar may be made on the new lands <lb/>in the States of New-York and Pennsylvania as <lb/>will supply the whole United States, and perhaps <lb/>in a little time furnish an article of exportation. <lb/>The profits of the manufactory of sugar, when <lb/>made by private families, will be greater than <lb/>when made by large works. A boiler, which will <lb/>cost only 16s. will be the whole expence that will <lb/>be necessary to carry on this business, and the <lb/>sugar may be made at a season of the year when <lb/>no work can be done upon a farm. The price of <lb/>it, when sent to Philadelphia, will be twice as high <lb/>as the same quantity of wheat.  The sugar trees <lb/>may be made to yield their juice without being <lb/>injured, and when they decay, fresh ones may easily <lb/>be cultivated in the soil upon which they now <lb/>grow. When we consider the value of sugar, its <lb/>general and wholesome use in diet, and above all, <lb/>that it has hitherto been obtained at the price of <lb/>the lives and liberty of our African brethren, we <lb/>cannot help congratulating our fellow citizens <lb/>upon the prospect of manufactories of that article <lb/>being established among us, whereby immense sums <lb/>of money will be saved to our country, and, what <lb/>is more, our country freed from the guilt of en<lb break="no"/>couraging the detestable traffic in human crea<lb break="no"/>tures.</p>
                <p>"Several hundred sugar-kettles, we hear, are <lb/>now making in New Jersey, for the use of the <lb/>the New England settlers of the Susquehannahand Delaware."</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Vermont, Kentucky, Indiana</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">The Western Ter<lb break="no"/>ritory</hi>.</p>
                <p>About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wil<lb break="no"/>derness; they only began to settle it about the <lb/>year 1774. Kentucky, ten years ago, lay in fo<lb break="no"/>rest wild, it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid <lb/>has been the population, that there are not less <lb/>than one hundred thousand inhabitants, already, <lb/>in each of these States. The State of Indiana <lb/>was only laid off this present year 1789, and con<lb break="no"/>tains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From <lb/>a description of these four States, published in <lb/>American in May last, we give our readers a <lb/>short abridged description of the last of them, <lb/>called <hi rend="italic">The Western Territory</hi>; and it must re<lb break="no"/>rejoiced the heart of every Briton to read it, and <lb/>think, that the settling of these countries, though <lb/>the Americans double their numbers every 15 or <lb/>20 years, will long keep them from manufactur<lb break="no"/>ing, and is every day opening a field for new cus<lb break="no"/>tomers to Great Britain; for who will work as a <lb/>tradesman, even though wages are very high, <lb/>when he can, for twenty pounds, purchase a thou<lb break="no"/>sand acres of land, that being the present price <lb/>fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western <lb/>Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufac<lb break="no"/>tures will continually increase with the increasing <lb/>population of America.–Desponding politicians <lb/>may derive comfort from the prospect, that new <lb/>channels of commerce will be opened, and the in<lb break="no"/>land parts of the Continent will require an incres<lb break="no"/>ing supply.–British manufactures will for ages <lb/>ascend the great rivers of that Continent, and by <lb/>means of a most extraordinary inland navigation, <lb/>will be diffused through a country more fertile, <lb/>more susceptible  of population, and six time <lb/>more extensive, than all the Thirteen United <lb/>States.</p>

                <p>Is the name given to this new State by Congress. <lb/>It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi riverlb/&gt;–north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania– <lb/>south and south-east by the Ohio reiver; contains, <lb/>according to Mr. Hutchins, Geographer General <lb/>to the Congress, 411,000 square miles, equal to <lb/>two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres, <lb/>from which he deducts forty-three millions of <lb/>acres for water; there will then remain two hun<lb break="no"/>red and twenty millions of acres belonging to <lb/>the foederal government, which is to be sold for <lb/>the discharthe debt owing to the United <lb/>States. But a <lb/>very small proportion of these<cb/>lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and <lb/>disposed of by Congress*.</p>
                <p>On the lands which have been purchased by <lb/>Congress from the Indians two settlements and <lb/>already commenced*#x2013;one at Marietta, the other <lb/>at Miami.</p>
                <p>This State was only laid out by Congress in <lb/>the end of the year 1787, and already contains <lb/>about 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are <lb/>the Mississippi, Ohio, Muskingham, Hockhock<lb break="no"/>ing, Sioto, Miami, Wobash, &amp;c.–Coal and iron <lb/>mines, and salt pits, abound in this State; the <lb/>soil is excellent–as rich as can be imagined, and <lb/>may  be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little <lb/>or no labour. It is exceeding healthy, pleasant, <lb/>and commodious–the most fertile sport of earth <lb/> known to the Europeans or Americans–exceed<lb break="no"/>ing the soil of any of the United States. The <lb/>timber is tall, and in great variety.–Streams for <lb/>mills abound here. Wheat, indigo, hemp, and <lb/>cotton, thrive well. Many years will probably <lb/>not escape before a good part of the country will <lb/>be brought to that degree of cultivation that will <lb/>exhibit all its latent beauties, and justify the de<lb break="no"/>scrpition of travellers, who call it the *garden of <lb/>of a great empire will be fixed in some future pe<lb break="no"/>the world*. It is here probably also that the centre <lb/>riod. It is the most centrical place for Congress <lb/>to accomodate themselves at. No country is <lb/>better stocked with wild game of every kind; <lb/>herds of deers, elks, bear, &amp;c. fill the extensive <lb/>meadows of this country–turkies, geese, swans, <lb/>and partridges, &amp;c. are innumerable. The rivers <lb/>are excellently stored with fish, and almost all na<lb break="no"/>vigable for small sloops.</p>
                <p>In the ordinance published by Congress for <lb/>the government of this territory, they are to <lb/>be allowed an Assembly when their number a<lb break="no"/>mounts to 30,000 persons' and when they ac<lb break="no"/>quire a certain degree of population they are to <lb/>have representatives in Congress; and when fifty <lb/>millions of acres are settled they are to be divided <lb/>into States.</p>
                <p>Rejoice, O Britons! that they must all be sup<lb break="no"/>plied with manufactures by you, and you *only*</p>
                <p>*No more than about twelve millions of acres have <lb/>yet been purchased of the poor natives, for which Con<lb break="no"/>gress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods <lb/>and rum.</p>
