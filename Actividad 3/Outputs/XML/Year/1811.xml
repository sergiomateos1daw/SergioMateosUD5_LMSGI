                <p>The population of Canada, in 1760, was reckoned <lb/>at 62,000 souls, whilst her exports had never ex<lb break="no"/>ceeded two millions of <hi rend="italic">livres tournois</hi>  (about <lb/>90,000l) The imports must have greatly ex<lb break="no"/>ceeded the exports ; but not even a conjecture of <lb/>the differences can be formed. The present popula<lb break="no"/>tion of the Canadas may be rated at 320,000 souls ; <lb/>but great as this augmentation may appear, commerce <lb/>will be found to have greatly surpassed the propor<lb break="no"/>tional ratio of the population.</p>
                <p>From 1763 to 1793, the exports may have varied <lb/>from 120,000l. to 300,000l. chiefly of wheat, furs, <lb/>and peltry. But, during the last 18 years, they have <lb/>increased to the surprising sum of 1,220,963l. 10s. <lb/>Sterling, as we shall presently perceive by the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing estimate, which cannot be much over or un<lb break="no"/>der the truth :-</p>
                <p>Furs and skims ... 105,000 0 <lb break="yes"/>Wheat, all other grain, flour, and biscuit 136,500 0 <lb break="yes"/>Lumber of all descriptions ... 536,500 0 <lb break="yes"/>Pot and pearl ashes ... 223,000 0 <lb break="yes"/>Beets and pork 30,000 0 <lb break="yes"/>Sundries (too tedious to particularise) ... 16,000 10 <lb break="yes"/>The hulls, masts, and yards, of 28 ves <lb break="yes"/>sels built in the province ... 84,000 0 <lb break="yes"/>Total of domestic produce 1,131,000 0 <lb break="yes"/>Sundry goods imported and exported 4,780 0 <lb break="yes"/>1,125,780 0 <lb break="yes"/>
            </p>
                <p>
               <cb/>Commissions and additional charges <lb/>at 7 1/2 per cent. Sterling ... 65,183 0 <lb/>t. 1,220,963</p>
                <p>The amounts of imports of dutiable articles at <lb/>
               <settlement n="6325494">Quebec</settlement> is about 380,000l. Sterling. It is impossi<lb break="no"/>ble to ascertain the value of goods not dutiable ; but <lb/>we may safely conlude, that they will make the to<lb break="no"/>tal of import as one million Sterling, leaving a balance <lb/>in favour of these provinces, which, but a few years <lb/>ago, would have appeared incredible. This proper<lb break="no"/>ty is carried by 661 vessels, whose tonnage is <lb/>143,893, navigated by 6758 seamen. The freight <lb/>and primage on these vessels are nine guineas per <lb/>ton, being 1,359,788l. 17s. Sterling, which, with<lb break="no"/>out taking into consideration the charges in Britain, <lb/>will make the gross amount of our cargoes landed, <lb/>exceed 3,000,000l. Sterling, being about a tenth of <lb/>the imports of the <country n="2635167">United Kingdom</country>.</p>
                <p>
               <pb n="5"/>Our commerce has become considerable with the <lb/>
               <country n="6252001">United States</country>. A few years ago, our imports from <lb/>thence greatly exceeded our exports. But since re<lb break="no"/>spectable and intelligent American merchants have <lb/>begun to settle amongst us, I believe the scale turned <lb/>in our favour ; and thus British industry is com<lb break="no"/>mencing to run in a channel never before much <lb/>thought of.</p>
