               <hi rend="center">Extract of a letter from an Englishman, dated Lima, Sep<lb break="no"/>tember 10, 1821.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>"Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colo<lb break="no"/>nial town; 6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; <lb/>the whites are about 1200 Europeans, and not as many <lb/>born in the country; the rest are blacks and mulattoes. <lb/>Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never <lb/>saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty <lb/>and miserty than in any town of the size in the world.– <lb/>There are some few splendid houses, but the rest so dis<lb break="no"/>gustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being <lb/>covered with dust and vermin. The streets, as in all A<lb break="no"/>merican towns, run at right angles; a powerful stream of <lb/>water in each : the town is capable of great improvement. <lb/>The climate must be bad, for the whole population look as <lb/>if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born <lb/>race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of <lb/>Peru we made the same observation; the ague very gene<lb break="no"/>ral, with fever–their habits and manner of living increase <lb/>the evil: thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold <lb/>–I sleep under a heavy blanket, and could bear another; a <lb/>thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter; the <lb/>heat however is not excessive during summer; on the whole <lb/>not an oppressive climate, if the people had any idea of living <lb/>in a rational way. Very few families cook at home–they <lb/>buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets, in pulperias, <lb/>and in the squares: not six families in Lima that have wine <lb/>on their tables: they drink brandy at all hours, and excuse <lb/>themselves for not having any thing that is expensive, by <lb/>saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies him<lb break="no"/>self a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in <lb/>the evening. Their money goes in gambling, debauchery, <lb/>and dress; every woman, high and low, has her price; a lady <lb/>take no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you <lb/>she is quite as good as her neighbours, and needs be no bet<lb break="no"/>ter. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause <lb/>of all the degradation of South America: every Viceroy, <lb/>from Pizarro to Pezuela, was a plunderer, a teacher of <lb/>immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of <lb/>this people seems incredible–one must see to believe it : <lb/>scarcely a young lady can read or write, or use a needle; <lb/>few houses that the Devil has not appeared in; and a de<lb break="no"/>vout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin <lb/>Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves : as to <lb/>priestcraft, it reigns here in all its glory : a third part of <lb/>Lima is covered with churches, some of them very splen<lb break="no"/>did. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the <lb/>single mine of the mountain of Pasco for returns : if this <lb/>is worked to advantage, it will produce six millions of <lb/>produce. Mining may be carried to any extent, it is true; <lb/>but this requires tranquility and good government. Peo<lb break="no"/>ple in Europe have the most erroneous ideas of Peru; <lb/>every traveller and historian who has written or talked a<lb break="no"/>bout it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar.</p>
                <p>"Arica, the second port of Peru, and the great outlet to <lb/>Upper Peru, is a wretched village of hovels covered with <lb/>mud–about 400 Mulattoes and Indians–placed on a sand <lb/>bank–the pepole all in the ague–not a boat or ship of any <lb/>sort. The harbour-master came off on a bulsa, (two blad<lb break="no"/>ders lashed together,) paddled by an Indian. We could not <lb/>get a basket of fruit or vegetables for money. Their culti<lb break="no"/>vation was three leagues off, but they were too lazy to <lb/>fetch any thing, though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to <lb/>twenty hours, offering them any price for their tropical <lb/>fruits.</p>
                <p>"I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month, and sleep on <lb/>the ground; borrowed a chair, and bought some crockery <lb/>No such thing as a tavern : never was. Letters of no use; <lb/>no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at eight o'clock <lb/>to kill time. A play twice a week : the most fashionable <lb/>ladies stand up in the front boxes, and light a segar by the <lb/>chandlier; the house filled with smoke.</p>
                <p>"There are 82 titled familes, mostly idiots–all reduced <lb/>to poverty by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war <lb/>be continued a year, Peru will be the most wretched coun<lb break="no"/>try on the globe; indeed the Indians will regain their em<lb break="no"/>pire, and exterminate all other colours. The number of <lb/>blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy thousand– <lb/>25,000 in Lima and adjacent villages; the total population <lb/>of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians.</p>
                <p>"About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty <lb/>country houses. Provisions of all sorts excellent, and in <lb/>the greatest variety; fruits of all climates in the market<lb break="no"/>place, the produce of the sea-shore and the Cordillera.– <lb/>Beef and mutton excellent–the chief supplies come from <lb/>Jauja an other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore <lb/>produce is contiued to little vallies badly cultivated; those <lb/>about the town would disgrace the free negroes of Caro<lb break="no"/>lina. Most valuable land a league from the town, half <lb/>cultivated and half abandoned; every thing left to starved <lb/>slaves; such famished objects I never behald; no other hands <lb/>to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general, they <lb/>will not work, and famine must ensue. "</p>

               <hi rend="center">Extract of a letter from an Englishman, dated Lima, Sep<lb break="no"/>temper 10, 1821</hi>
            </p>
                <p>"Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colo<lb break="no"/>nial town; 6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; <lb/>the whites are about 1200 Europeans, and not as many <lb/>born in the country; the rest are blacks and mulattoes. <lb/>Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never <lb/>saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty <lb/>and misery than in any town of the size in the world.– <lb/>There are some few splendid houses, but the rest so dis<lb break="no"/>gustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin. The streets, as in all A<lb break="no"/>merican towns, run at right angles; a powerful stream of <lb/>water in each; the town is capable of great improvement. <lb/>The climate must be bad, for the whole population look as <lb/>if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born <lb/>race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of <lb/>Peru we made the same observation; the ague very gene<lb break="no"/>ral, with fever–their habits and manner of living increase <lb/>the evil; thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold <lb/>–I sleep under a heavy blanket, and could bear another; a <lb/>thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter; the <lb/>heat however is not excessive during summer; on the whole <lb/>not an oppressive climate, if the people had any idea of living <lb/>in a rational way. Very few families cook at home℃they <lb/>buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets, in pulperias, <lb/>and in the squares; not six families in Lima that have wine <lb/>on their tables; they drink brandy at all hours, and excuse <lb/>themselves for not having any thing that is expensive by <lb/>saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies him<lb break="no"/>self a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in <lb/>the evening. Their money goes in gambling, debauchery, <lb/>and dress; every woman, high and low, has her price; a lady <lb/>takes no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you <lb/>she is quite at good as her neighbours, and needs be no bet<lb break="no"/>ter. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause <lb/>of all the degradation of South America; every Viceroy, <lb/>from Pizarro to Pezuela, was a plunderer, a teacher of <lb/>immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of <lb/>this people seems incredible–one must see to believe it; <lb/>scarcely a young lady can read or write, or use a needle; <lb/>few houses that the Devil has not appeared in; and a de<lb break="no"/>vout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin <lb/>Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves; as to <lb/>priestcraft, it reigns here in all its glory; a third part of <lb/>Lima is covered with churches, some of them very splen<lb break="no"/>did. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the <lb/>single mine of the mountain of Pasco for returns; if this <lb/>is worked to advantage, it will produce six millions of <lb/>dollars; but if the country is disturbed by war, not a dollar <lb/>will they have. The exports of Peru, in ordinary times, <lb/>were five millions of dollars in pecie, and one million in <lb/>produce. Mininng may be carried to any extent, it is true; <lb/>but this requires tranquillity and good government. Peo<lb break="no"/>ple in Europe have the most erroneous ideas or Peru; <lb/>every traveller and historian who has written or talked a<lb break="no"/>bout it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar."</p>
                <p>"Arica, the second port of Peru, and the great outlet to <lb/>Upper Peru, is a wretched village of hovels covered with <lb/>mud–about 400 Mulattoes and Indians–placed on a sand <lb/>bank–the people all in the ague–not a boat or ship of any <lb/>sort. The harbour-master came off on bulsa, (two blad<lb break="no"/>ders lashed together,) paddled by an Indian. We could not <lb/>get a basket of fruit or vegetablse for money. Their cultu<lb break="no"/>vation was three leagues off, but they were too lazy to <lb/>fetch any thing, though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to <lb/>twnety hours, offering them any price for their tropical <lb/>fruits.</p>
                <p>"I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month, and sleep on <lb/>the ground; borrowed a chair, and bought some crockery. <lb/>No such thing as a tavern; never was. Letters of no use; <lb/>no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at eight o'clock <lb/>to kill time. A play twice a week; the most fashionable <lb/>ladies stand up in the front boxes, and light a segar by the <lb/>chandelier; the house filled with smoke.</p>
                <p>"There are 82 titled families, mostly idiots–all reduced <lb/>to poverty by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war <lb/>be continued a year, Peru will be the most wretched coun<lb break="no"/>try on the globe; indeed the Indians will regain their em<lb break="no"/>pire, and exterminate all other colours. the number of <lb/>blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy thousand– <lb/>25,000 in Lima and adjacent village, the total population <lb/>of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians.</p>
                <p>"About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty <lb/>country houses. Provisions of all sorts excellent, and in <lb/>the greatest variety; fruits of all climates in the market<lb break="no"/>place, the produce of the sea-shore and the Cordillera.– <lb/>Beef and mutton excellent–the chief supplies come from <lb/>Janja and other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore <lb/>produce is continued to little vallies badly cultivated; those <lb/>about the town would disgrace the free negroes of Caro<lb break="no"/>lina. Most valuable land a league from the town, half <lb/>cultivated and half abandoned; every thing left to starved <lb/>slaves; such famished objects I never beheld; no other hands <lb/>to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general, they <lb/>will not work, and famine must ensue."</p>
