               <hi rend="smallcaps">New Zealand</hi>.–On Wednesday a public meeting <lb/>was held in the Guildhall of the city of London, pur<lb break="no"/>suant to a requisition to the Lord Mayor, for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of petitioning her Majesty and both Houses of <lb/>Parliament " to adopt prompt and efficient measures <lb/>for preserving from invasion or abandonment the long<lb break="no"/>established sovereignty of the British Crown in the <lb/>islands of New Zealand, at present endangered by <lb/>foreign pretensions, and by the acts of the Executive Go<lb break="no"/>vernment ; also for stopping the course of lawless emi<lb break="no"/>gration and settlement, which has not only proved <lb/>deeply injurious to the native people of the country, <lb/>but threatens their speedy extermination ; and, lastly, <lb/>for establishing the most beneficial system of coloni<lb break="no"/>zation, and the protection and restraints of British <lb/>law, under a distinct colonial government, in place of <lb/>the state of anarchy which now prevails among both <lb/>races, and all other classes of her Majesty's subjects, and <lb/>others inhabiting or resorting to New Zealand, as a <lb/>distant independency of the territory of New South <lb/>Wales." Including the gentlemen of the hustings, <lb/>the entire number might be calculated at 400 indivi<lb break="no"/>duals. The Lord Mayor took the chair. Resolu<lb break="no"/>tions in accordance with the object of the meeting <lb/>were moved and seconded by Mr G. Palmer, M.P., <lb/>Mr F. Baring, M.P., Mr Hawes, M.P., Mr G. F. <lb/>Young, Mr Ward, M.P., and others. On the mo<lb break="no"/>tion of Mr G.

               <lb/>?It will gratify the admirers of the Duke of Welling<lb break="no"/>ton to learn, that the Directors of the New Zealand <lb/>Company have resolved that the name of the city <lb/>founded by Colonel Wakefield, Lambton Harbour, <lb/>Port Nicholson, and which is destined to become the <lb/>capital of New Zealand, shall be named "The City <lb/>of Wellington," in honour of the illustrious Duke. <lb/>The Duke is a great advocate for colonization, and to <lb/>him the promoters of colonization of South Aus<lb break="no"/>tralia were in a great measure indebted for securing <lb/>the enactment of the statute which gave effect to the <lb/>principles on which that colony is founded ; and, as many <lb/>of the promoters of South Australian emigration are Di<lb break="no"/>rectors of the New Zealand Company, they have re<lb break="no"/>solved, setting all party politics aside, to confer this ho<lb break="no"/>nour on the Duke. There could be no stronger proof of <lb/>the political sagacity and statesmanlike views of the <lb/>Duke, than his approval of the Wakefield system <lb/>of colonization, and no better mode of perpetuating <lb/>his name than by bestowing it on the metropolis of the <lb/>"Great Britain of the Southern Hemisphere."</p>

                <p>Narrative of a Whaling Voyage Round <lb/>The Globe &amp;c. &amp;c By Frederick Debell <lb/>Bennett, Esq., F.R.G.S. 2 vols. London: <lb/>Richard Bentley.</p>
                <p>We have been somewhat disappointed in these <lb/>volumes. We expected to have found them, like <lb/>Scoresby's, full of interesting details regarding <lb/>whale fishing, whereas, there is hardly a word on <lb/>the subject throughout the whole of the first vo<lb break="no"/>lume, and very little in the second ; in fact, what <lb/>there is, is confined to a sort of supplementary ap<lb break="no"/>pendix. This is the more strange, that one of the <lb/>chief purposes of the author, as he himself informs <lb/>us, in undertaking this voyage, was to investigate <lb/>the anatomy and habits of southern whales, and <lb/>the mode of conducting the sperm whale fishery, <lb/>subjects which, he remarks, were then untouched <lb/>by the literature of any country. Yet, in the <lb/>work itself, this chief purpose dwindles into one <lb/>of very secondary prominence. This, the readers <lb/>of the work, at least most of them, will the more <lb/>regret, on finding how very curious and interest<lb break="no"/>ing are the two or three chapters which the author <lb/>has given on the subject of South Sea whaling. <lb/>There are full of entertaining details of both a <lb/>popular and scientific character, and cannot be <lb/>read without exciting a wish that larger portion <lb/>of the work had been composed of such material.</p>
                <p>In making these remarks, however, we are far <lb/>from intending to depreciate the sort of informa<lb break="no"/>tion, in the shape chiefly of sketches of the South <lb/>Sea Islands, to which the greater part of the vo<lb break="no"/>lumes are devoted ; we mean merely to say, that <lb/>it is not what we expected from the title of the <lb/>work, nor, we may add, what, for our own reading, <lb/>we should have preferred. Yet are these sketches <lb/>very amusing reading–full of graphic descriptions <lb/>and curious details of native character, which is <lb/>still found in the South Sea Islands in a state of <lb/>very primitive simplicity. "We have frequently <lb/>seen," says Mr Bennett, " amongst the congrega<lb break="no"/>gation assembled at Church (in Raiatea), a native <lb/>clothed in nothing but a shirt ; another with a <lb/>beaver hat surmounting a person naked except <lb/>the scanty maro ; and a third, whose whole attire <lb/>was a black coat, white neckerchief, and a shirt!"</p>
                <p>We observe a rather odd circumstance noted <lb/>by Mr Bennett. He says that the " temperate <lb/>ships" of America are the principal purveyors of <lb/>ardent spirits to the natives of the South Sea <lb/>Islands, carrying large quantities of rum thither <lb/>for the purposes of traffic! This is placing the <lb/>temperance principle in a somewhat curious pre<lb break="no"/>dicament.</p>
                <p>Another remark of the author's not less strik<lb break="no"/>ing–mark it well and take comfort from it ye <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">bon vivants[?]</hi>  of the civilzed world–is, that disease <lb/>is as abundant amongst the native islanders as <lb/>amongst the most refined of their species, and from <lb/>this concludes, that man in his savage state is as <lb/>liable to the " ills that flesh is heir to," as in his <lb/>civilised condition. Dr Johnson made a similar <lb/>remark regarding the Highlanders of Scotland ; <lb/>alleging that the London alderman lived as long <lb/>over his turtle feast, as the Highlander over his <lb/>paten cake. What degree of fellow-feeling with <lb/>civic dignitary and his good living, or whether <lb/>any, dictated this remark of the learned doctor, <lb/>we cannot say.</p>
                <p>Mr Bennett's work is written with great ability, <lb/>and in style whose only fault is exhibited in a <lb/>tendency, occasionally, to the use of rather learned <lb/>phraseology.</p>
                <p>We conclude with an extract from that portion <lb/>of the work which, from its great interest, we <lb/>regretted was not larger, but which, limited <lb/>as it is, is so full of curious information, and so <lb/>crowded with remarkable incident, as to render <lb/>the selection by no means an easy task.</p>
                <p>"Some sperm whales appear reluctant to employ <lb/>their tail when attacked, but prove active and danger<lb break="no"/>ous with their jaws. Such individuals often rather seek <lb/>than avoid the attacking boats, and, rushing upon them <lb/>with open mouth, employ every possible art to crush <lb/>them with their teeth, and, if successful, will sometimes <lb/>continue in their neighbourhood, biting the wreck and <lb/>oars into small fragments. When thus threatening a <lb/>boat, the whale usually turns and swings upon its back, <lb/>and will sometimes act in a very sluggish and unac<lb break="no"/>countable manner, keeping its formidable lower jaw <lb/>suspended for some moments over the boat, in a threat<lb break="no"/>ening attitude, but ultimately rolling to one side, and <lb/>closing its mouth harmlessly ; nor is it rare to observe <lb/>this whale, when pursued and attacked, retain[?] its mouth <lb/>in an expanded state for some minutes together. Such <lb/>threatening demonstrations of the jaw, as well as some <lb/>others with the flukes, occasionally compel a boat's <lb/>crew to leap into the water, and support themselves <lb/>by swimming or clinging to oars until the danger has <lb/>passed.</p>
                <p>"In the year 1835, the ship Pusie Hall encountered <lb/>a fighting whale, which after injuring and driving off <lb/>her four boats, pursued them to the ship, and withstood <lb/>for some time the lances hurled at it, by the crew, from <lb/>the bows of the vessel, before in could be induced to <lb/>retire ; in this affair a youth in one of the boats was <lb/>destroyed by a blow from the whale, and one of the <lb/>officers was severely lacerated by coming in contact <lb/>with the animal's jaw.</p>
                <p>"A highly tragical instances of the power and fero<lb break="no"/>city occasionally displayed by the sperm whale, is re<lb break="no"/>corded in the fate of the American South-Seaman <lb/>Essex, Captain G. Pollard. This vessel, when cruis<lb break="no"/>ing in the Pacific Ocean, in the year 1820, was wrecked <lb/>by a whale under the following extraordinary circum<lb break="no"/>stances. The boats had been lowered in pursuit of a <lb/>school of whales, and the ship was attending them to <lb/>windward. The master and second mate were engaged <lb/>with whales they had harpooned, in the midst of the <lb/>school, and the chief mate had returned on board to <lb/>equip a spare boat, in lieu of his own, which had been <lb/>broken and rendered unserviceable. While the crew <lb/>were thus occupied, the look-out at the masthead re<lb break="no"/>ported that a large whale was coming rapidly down <lb/>upon the ship, the mate hastened his task, in the <lb/>hope that he might be ready in time to attack it.</p>
                <p>"The Cachalot, which was of the largest size, con<lb break="no"/>sequently a male, and probably the guardian of the <lb/>school, in the meanwhile approached the ship so closely, <lb/>that the although the helm was put up to avoid the con<lb break="no"/>tact, he struck her a severe blow, which broke off a <lb/>portion of her keel. The enraged animal was then ob<lb break="no"/>served to retire to some distance, and again rush upon <lb/>the ship with extreme velocity. His enormous head <lb/>struck the starboard bow, beating in a corresponding <lb/>portion of the planks, and the people on board had <lb/>barely time to take to their boats, before the ship filled <lb/>with water and fell over on her side. She did not sink, <lb/>however, for some hours ; and the crew in the boats <lb/>continued near the wreck until they had obtained a <lb/>small supply of provisions, when they shaped a course <lb/>for land ; but here, it is to be regretted, they made a <lb/>fatal error. At the time the accident happened they <lb/>were cruising on the Equator, in the longitude of about <lb/>118[?] degrees West, with the Marquesan and Society <lb/>Islands on their lee, and might have sailed in their <lb/>boats to either of those groups in a comparatively short <lb/>time. Under an erroneous impression, however, that <lb/>all those lands were inhabited by an inhospitable race <lb/>of people, they preferred pulling to windward for the <lb/>coast of Peru, and in the attempt were exposed for a <lb/>lengthened period in extreme privations."</p>
                <p>A few Cachalots have been noted individually as <lb/>animals dangerous to attack. One was thus distin<lb break="no"/>guished on the cruising ground off the coast of New <lb/>Zealand, and was long know to whalers by the name <lb/>of 'New Zealand Tom.' He is said to have been of <lb/>great size, conspicuously distinguished by a white <lb/>hump ; and famous for the havoc he had made amongst <lb/>the boats and gear of ships attempting his destruction. <lb/>A second example, of cimilar celebrity, was known to <lb/>whalers in the Straits of Timor. He had so often <lb/>succeeded in repelling the attacks of his foes as to be <lb/>considered invincible, but was at length despatched by <lb/>a whaler, who, forewarned of his combative temper, <lb/>adopted the expedient of floating a cask on the sea, to <lb/>withdraw his attention from the boats ; but notwith<lb break="no"/>standing this <hi rend="italic">ruse</hi>  the animal was not destroyed with<lb break="no"/>out much hard fighting, nor until the bow of one of <lb/>the boats had been nipped off by his jaws."</p>

                <p>( <hi rend="italic">From the Glasgow Argus.</hi>.</p>
                <p>On Monday night a public meeting, chiefly com<lb break="no"/>posed of the working classes, was held in the Justi<lb break="no"/>ciary Court Hall, Glasgow, for the purpose of memo<lb break="no"/>rializing Lord John Russell in favour of obtaining <lb/>the Lord Provost in the chair. The hall was crowded <lb/>to excess, and it was perfectly evident from the first that <lb/>the Chartists had mustered in great strength to carry <lb/>out their usual course of obstruction to the particular <lb/>business of the evening.–Mr T. Gillespie proposed a <lb/>resolution in favour of emigration to New Zealand <lb/>through the medium of funds raised by the sale of <lb/>lands in the colony, and addressed the meeting at <lb/>some length in support of the resolution.–Mr R. Malcolm, jun. <lb/>a young lad, and a Chartist spouter, after a long <lb/>speech, proposed an amendment; to the effect that <lb/>while the meeting was favourable to emigration to New <lb/>Zealand, or any other part of the world, by those so <lb/>disposed, they objected to any application being <lb/>made for a grant of public money for any such pur<lb break="no"/>pose–that they were opposed to the question of emi<lb break="no"/>gration being allowed to occupy public attention, &amp;c. <lb/>and concluded with the statement that emigration <lb/>would not afford even temporary relief to the oppressed <lb/>operatives, and that bad laws were the chief cause of <lb/>all their present sufferings, &amp;c. This amendment <lb/>which was supported by the most trifling arguments <lb/>we ever heard brought forward in public, was of <lb/>course loudly cheered by the Chartists. The Lord <lb/>Provost repeatedly explained that he had agreed to <lb/>take the chair on the understanding that the subject <lb/>of emigration to New Zealand was to occupy the atten<lb break="no"/>tion ; but here a matter, perfectly foreign to the busi<lb break="no"/>ness for which they were convened, was introduced by <lb/>way of amendment ; there was an attack made upon <lb/>the general policy of the country–and he had posi<lb break="no"/>tively to state that, if such an amendment was carried, <lb/>he would not remain in the chair. This was received <lb/>by cries for "a new chairman" and much confusion, <lb/>one party cheering, and the other hissing and yelling <lb/>alternately during the greater part of the evening. A <lb/>discussion followed, in which a boy named Jack took <lb/>a prominent part ; and it became perfectly evident that <lb/>the Chartist speakers were woefully ignorant of the <lb/>subject they had the impudence to discuss. It was <lb/>gravely and indignantly averred, that by going to New <lb/>Zealand, the working men would incur the risk of <lb/>being swallowed by cannibals! Till informed of the <lb/>contrary, the Chartists seemed to think that the means <lb/>of emigration were to be supplied from the public ex<lb break="no"/>chequer ; and when told that the funds were to be <lb/>raised by the sale of lands in New Zealand, one of <lb/>them sagely observed that it would be much more <lb/>humane and just to appropriate the proceeds of those <lb/>sales of land to employ it in sending out emigrants ! <lb/>Another favourite argument was, that every person <lb/>had a right to subsist in the land that gave him <lb/>birth, and that it was barbarous and cruel to send <lb/>a man, however wretched, out of his native <lb/>country ; also, that emigration would produce no <lb/>benefit to society at home, as the places of those <lb/>sent off would soon be filled by others. Of <lb/>course, if these arguments had always been held <lb/>good, and acted upon, the whole human family would, <lb/>to this day, have been crowded together in the cradle <lb/>of our race in the East, provided only the thing had <lb/>been possible; the extension of mankind to other parts <lb/>of the world must have been wicked, and cruel, and <lb/>useless–for "for every inhabitant of a country is entitled <lb/>to a subsistence in the land that gave him birth," and, <lb/>on his removal to another land, his place would just be <lb/>filled by others ! The above is a mere specimen of <lb/>the worse than childish arguments used by the Chartist <lb/>spouters, and which the men who are now " knocking <lb/>loudly at the door of the constitution for admission," <lb/>cheered as if they had been fraught with the choicest <lb/>wisdom !–Mr John Crawford, Secretary to the New <lb/>Zealand Land Company, endeavoured, by some sensible <lb/>remarks, to place the question of emigration to New <lb/>Zealand on its proper footing ; but in vain ; they were <lb/>determined to have the charter only–and till then <lb/>starving workmen, willing, but unable, to emigrate, <lb/>must starve on. On a division, the amendment pro<lb break="no"/>posed by Mr Malcolm was carried by a large majority, <lb/>and, after a vote of thanks had been given to the Lord <lb/>Provost, the meeting broke up. This was not done, <lb/>however, till the Chartists were called upon to be at <lb/>their posts at the meeting to be held to-day to address <lb/>the Queen–to render themselves, of course, a little <lb/>more odious by another stretch of their obstructive <lb/>power–if they can.</p>
