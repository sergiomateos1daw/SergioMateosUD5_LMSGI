                <p>QUEBEC, <hi rend="italic">December</hi>  2, 1790 <lb/>Yesterday's post from Montreal, conveyed let<lb break="no"/>ters to several gentlemen in town, all corroborati<lb break="no"/>ing the following extract.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="smallcaps">SIR</hi>, <lb/>"I have to inform you by several letters re<lb break="no"/>ceived here on Saturday from Detroit, "we are <lb/>informed the Americans, under General Sinclair, <lb/>had been twice defeated, about the 19th ult. with <lb/>the loss of from 500 to 600 men, by the Indians <lb/>The Indians first attacked a body of 300 horse <lb/>which they had drawn into a snare, and cut the <lb/>whole of them off. In a second engagement, they <lb/>were likewise victorious, having nearly killed as <lb/>many. On account of which, Sinclair thought <lb/>proper to retreat; and the last accounts state the <lb/>Indians having divided themselves into small par<lb break="no"/>ties, had so harrassed him, that he was obliged to <lb/>leave the wounded in the field–Sinclair lost his <lb/>artillery, a cohorn, and grass-hopper. It is said <lb/>the Indians are very much elated at their success, <lb/>and that numbers were daily joining them, at <lb/>their head quarters, about the Maimis towns– <lb/>One Indian, it is said, killed 30 with his own <lb/>hand.</p>
                <p>"The Indians were extremely civil to the <lb/>traders from Detriot, having assisted them, when <lb/>they knew of the approach of the Americans, to <lb/>remove their property to safety, except ammuni<lb break="no"/>tion and arms. These are facts so well ascertain<lb break="no"/>ed, that there does not remain the least doubt <lb/>of them:</p>
                <p>They may be attended with very serious and <lb/>important consequences to the province, as I dare <lb/>say, all will be imputed to the British for supply<lb break="no"/>ing these Indians with arms and ammunition.– <lb/>In short, I would not be surprized to hear of an <lb/>American army raising, to attack this country. <lb/>* The loss is here specified, but other letters differing <lb/>in number, we shall only say, the estimate in general <lb/>does not appear considerable.</p>

               <pb n="2"/> The unsettled state of a great part of the West<lb break="no"/>tern Frontiers of America (if we can suppose that <lb/>there are any determined frontiers when the set<lb break="no"/>tlers are making large and continual encroach<lb break="no"/>ments) must very much depreciate the sale of lands <lb/>in those parts, notwithstanding the very small <lb/>rates of purchase demanded for vast extents of <lb/>ground, and the soil being remarkable fertile and <lb/>productive. The ineffectual attempts of last sum<lb break="no"/>mer to prevent the future depredations of the Mi<lb break="no"/>amis, and some other tribes of Indians, and the <lb/>barbarities before and since committed on the set<lb break="no"/>lers, must occasion other people to be very cau<lb break="no"/>tious of removing to places where they would hold <lb/>their lives and property on a very precarious te<lb break="no"/>ure, unless the arms of the State prove remark<lb break="no"/>ably successful in their future attacks.</p>

               <pb n="3"/> Mr. Bowles, the Cherokee Chief, proposes to <lb/>introduce the art of Printing amongst the Indi<lb break="no"/>ans, with whom he resides; and, for this purpose, <lb/>has engaged two persons to accompany him on <lb/>his return, and has provided himself with all the <lb/>implements of the art. The day fixed for their <lb/>departure is the 20th of March</p>
                <p>The Indian companions of Mr. Bowles are two <lb/>Creeks and two Cherokees. these nations, <lb/>though contiguous to each other, and in strict <lb/>union, differ as essentially as possible in language <lb/>and manners. Both, however, entertain the most <lb/>implacable animosity against the Spaniards, whose <lb/>authority and dominions in South America they <lb/>make no scruple of avowing they mean to try to <lb/>diminish.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Muskingum  <lb/>to his Friend in the City of Norwich, (Connecti<lb break="no"/>cut,) dated Nov</hi>. 24, 1790.</p>
                <p>"The prospect of peace from our frontiers, <lb/>seems to me to be vanished for the present; the <lb/>troops from this garrison have this morning re<lb break="no"/>turned, and the best account I can collect of the <lb/>expedition is as follows: viz. the troops amount<lb break="no"/>ing to about 1200 militia, and about 300 regulars, <lb/>after seventeen days march from Miami, reached <lb/>the great Miami village, about 170 miles, with<lb break="no"/>out any molestation, except having a number of <lb/>their pack-horse stole.–On their arrival they <lb/>found the village deserted, and all the valua<lb break="no"/>ble builder a short tarry, they proceeded to neigh<lb break="no"/>ings set on flames by the Indians. Af<lb break="no"/>bouring villages, without molestation, and def<lb break="no"/>troyed five of them, and a quantity of corn, com<lb break="no"/>puted at fifteen thousand bushels, which they <lb/>found buried in different places, and very large <lb/>quantities of vegetables of every kind. The fir<supplied reason="copy blur">st</supplied> 
               <lb/>opposition that was met with, a party of about <lb/>150 Kentucky militia, and thirty regular troops, <lb/>all under the command of Col. Hardin, of Ken<lb break="no"/>tucky, were detached from the main body, lying <lb/>in the great Miami village, to pursue the track <lb/>of a party of Indians which had the day before <lb/>been discovered. After a pursuit of about six <lb/>miles, they came up with, and were attacked by <lb/>surprise, by a body of Indians, who were con<lb break="no"/>cealed in the thickets on every side of a large <lb/>plain; and on the first onset the militia, without <lb/>exchanging a single fire, made a most precipitate <lb/>retreat, and left the regular troops to stand the <lb/>whole charge of the Indians; the conflict was <lb/>short and bloody; the troops were soon overpower<lb break="no"/>ed by numbers, and all fell, except the two offi<lb break="no"/>ers and two or three privates, after defending <lb/>themselves at their bayonet points with the great<lb break="no"/>est possible obstinacy. Ensign Hartshorn, of <lb/>Franklin, was one of the four that escaped, and <lb/>his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly <lb/>circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat, <lb/>and by that means screening himself from the eye <lb/>of his pursuers, that from any other circumstance. <lb/>Captain Armstrong, who commanded the party, <lb/>likewise made his escape, by plunging himself in<lb break="no"/>to a pond or swamp, up to his neck, within two <lb/>hundred yards of the field of action, where he re<lb break="no"/>mained the whole night, as a spectator of the hor<lb break="no"/>rid scene of the War Dance, performed over the <lb/>dead and wounded bodies of the poor soldiers that <lb/>had fallen the preceding day, where their shrieks, <lb/>mixed with the horrid yells of the savages, ren<lb break="no"/>dered his situation shocking. After this, some <lb/>few skirmishes succeeded, but nothing material, <lb/>until the second capital action, which happened <lb/>two days after the army left the Miami village. <lb/>At ten miles distance from the town, the Gene<lb break="no"/>ral ordered a halt, and detached from four to five <lb/>hundred militia, and about sixty regular soldiers, <lb/>commanded by Major Wylls, all under the com<lb break="no"/>mand of Col. Harden, with orders to march back <lb/>to the town. On their first entrance into the <lb/>town, there appeared a small body of Indians, <lb/>who immediately fled at the first onset, and by <lb/>that means decoyed the whole body of militia, by <lb/>making their flight into different directions, and <lb/>encouraging the militia to pursue; by this means <lb/>the regular troops were left alone, and the Indi<lb break="no"/>ans had effected their design; for the moment <lb/>they found the small handful of regular troops de<lb break="no"/>tached from the main body of militia, they com<lb break="no"/>menced the attack with their whole force, except<lb break="no"/>ing the flying parties that had diverted the mili<lb break="no"/>tia; and although they soon found some part of <lb/>the militia returning on their back, pursued their <lb/>object of routing and destroying the troops; as <cb/>the only sure plan of success; which, after the bloody <lb/>conflict on each side, they effect. The regular <lb/>troops, all to nine, including two commissioned <lb/>officers, were killed and disabled, and a total de<lb break="no"/>feat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls, <lb/>of Hartford, and Lieut. Frothingham, of Mid<lb break="no"/>dletown. Of the militia, it is said, about an hun<lb break="no"/>dred were killed, among whom were a number <lb/>of brave and valuable characters. The Indians, <lb/>it appears, from some cause, did not think it pru<lb break="no"/>dent to pursue their successes from the field of ac<lb break="no"/>tion, for most of the troops that were not killed, <lb/>or sorely wounded, made their escape, which they <lb/>never could have done had the Indians pursued <lb/>with their usual fury.</p>
                <p>"Nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the <lb/>Indians on this occasion; the militia they appear<lb break="no"/>ed to despise, and with all the undautedness <lb/>conceivable, threw down their guns, and rushed <lb/>upon the bayonets of the regular soldiers; a great <lb/>number of them fell; but being so far superior in <lb/>numbers soon overpowered them, for while the <lb/>poor soldier had his bayonet in one Indiaman, <lb/>two more would sink their tomahawks in his head. <lb/>The defeat of our troops was complete, the dead <lb/>and wounded were left on the field in possession <lb/>of the savages.</p>
                <p>"No damage, of any consequence, has been <lb/>sustained in this part of the country from the In<lb break="no"/>dians; but what effect the expedition may have <lb/>on us, as relates to our frontier, it uncertain.– <lb/>If the Western Indians have any idea of treating <lb/>for peace, we shall be safe; if not, we are much <lb/>exposed."</p>

               <lb/>tion on being able to repeat my congratulations <lb/>on the favourable prospects which continue to di<lb break="no"/>tinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits <lb/>of another year have blessed our country with plen<lb break="no"/>ty, and with the means of flourishing commerce. <lb/>The progress of the public credit is witnessed by <lb/>a considerable rise of American stock abroad, as <lb/>well as at home; and the revenues allotted for <lb/>this and other national purposes, have been pro<lb break="no"/>ductive beyond the calculation by which they were <lb/>regulated. This latter circumstance is the more <lb/>pleasing, as it is not only a proof the fertility of <lb/>our resources, but as it assures us of a further in<lb break="no"/>crease of the national respectability and credit; <lb/>and let me add, as it bears an honourable testi<lb break="no"/>mony to the patriotism and integrity of the ma<lb break="no"/>rine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the <lb/>former in discharging their engagements has <lb/>been exemplary.</p>
                <p>"In conforming to the power vested in me <lb/>by acts of the last session, a loan of 3,000,,000 of <lb/>florins, towards which some provisional measures <lb/>had previously taken place, has been completed <lb/>in Holland.–As well the<supplied reason="copy blur">exchange</supplied> with which it <lb/>has been filled, as the nature of the terms (consi<lb break="no"/>dering the more than ordinary demand for bor<lb break="no"/>rowing, created by the situation of Europe) give <lb/>a reasonable hope that the further execution of <lb/>those powers, may proceed with advantage and <lb/>success. The secretary of the treasure has my <lb/>direction to communicate such further particu<lb break="no"/>lars as may be requisite for more precise infor<lb break="no"/>mation.</p>
                <p>"Since your last sessions, I have received commu<lb break="no"/>nication, by which it appears, that the district <lb/>of Kentucke, at present a part of Virginia, has <lb/>concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state, in consequence of which the dis<lb break="no"/>trict is to become a distinct number of the Uni<lb break="no"/>on; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be <lb/>added. For this sanction application is now made. <lb/>I shall cause the papers on this very important <lb/>transaction to be laid before you. The liberality <lb/>and harmony with which it has been conducted, <lb/>will be found to do great honour to both the par<lb break="no"/> 
               <cb/>ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of <lb/>the Union and its present Government, expres<lb break="no"/>sed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke, cannot <lb/>fail to add an affectionate concern for their par<lb break="no"/>ticular welfare, to the great national impressions <lb/>under which you will declare on the case sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to you.</p>
                <p>"It has been heretofore known to Congress <lb/>that frequent incursions have been made on our <lb/>frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians <lb/>from the north west side of the Ohio. These, <lb/>with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the <lb/>Wabash, have of late been particularly active in <lb/>their depredations; and, being emboldened by <lb/>the impunity of their crimes, and aided by such <lb/>parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be se<lb break="no"/>duced to join in their hostilities, or afford them <lb/>a retreat for their prisoners, and plunder, they <lb/>have, instead of listening to the humane invitati<lb break="no"/>ons and overtures made on the part of the Unit<lb break="no"/>ed States, renewed their violence with fresh ala<lb break="no"/>crity and greater effect–The lives of a number of <lb/>valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed, and <lb/>some of them under circumstances peculiarly <lb/>shocking, whilst others have been carried into a <lb/>deplorable captivity.</p>
                <p>"These aggravated provocations rendered it es<lb break="no"/>sential to the safety of the western settlements, <lb/>that the aggressors should be made sensible that the <lb/>government of the Union is not less capable of <lb/>punishing their crimes, than it is disposed to <lb/>respect their rights and rewards their attachments. <lb/>As this object could not be effected by defensive <lb/>measures, it became necessary to put in force the <lb/>act which empowers the President to call out the <lb/>militia for the protection of the frontiers; and <lb/>I have accordingly authorised an expedition, in <lb/>which the regular troops in that quarter are com<lb break="no"/>bined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. <lb/>The event of the measure is yet unknown to me, <lb/>The Secretary at War is directed to lay before <lb/>you a statement of the information on which it <lb/>is founded, as well as an estimate of the expence <lb/>with which it will be attended.</p>
                <p>The disturbed situation of Europe, and parti<lb break="no"/>cularly the critical posture of the great maritime <lb/>powers, whilst it ought to make us more thank<lb break="no"/>ful for the general peace and security enjoyed by <lb/>the United States, reminds us at the same time <lb/>of the circumspection with which it becomes us <lb/>to preserve these blessings. It requires also that <lb/>we should not overlook the tendency of a war, <lb/>and even of preparations for war among the na<lb break="no"/>tions most concerned in active commerce with <lb/>this country, to abridge in means, and there <lb/>by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable <lb/>productions to their proper markets. I recom<lb break="no"/>mend it to your serious reflections, how far and <lb/>in what mode it may be expedient to guard a<lb break="no"/>gainst embarrassments from these contingencies, <lb/>by such encouragements to ur own navigation <lb/>as will render our commerce andagriculture less <lb/>dependant of foreign bottoms, which may fail us <lb/>in the moments most interesting to both of these <lb/>great objects. Our fisheries and the transporta<lb break="no"/>tion of our own produce, offers us abundant means <lb/>for guarding ourselves against this evil.</p>
                <p>"Your attention seems to be not less due to <lb/>that particular branch of our trade which belongs <lb/>to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances <lb/>unite in rendering the present state of it destres<lb break="no"/>ful to us, that you will not think any deliberations <lb/>misemployed which may lead to its relief and <lb/>protection.</p>
                <p>"The laws you have already passed for the esta<lb break="no"/>blishment of a judiciary system, have opened the <lb/>doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. <lb/>You will consider in your wisdom, whether im<lb break="no"/>provement of a judicatory system, have opened <lb/>the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. <lb/>Yu will consider in your wisdom, whether im<lb break="no"/>
               <pb n="3"/> provements in that system may yet be made, and <lb/>particularly whether<supplied reason="copy blur">??? ???</supplied>process of exe<lb break="no"/>cution on sentences issuing from the Federal <lb/>Courts, be not desirable through all the States.</p>
                <p>"The patronage of our commerce, of our <lb/>merchants and seamen, has called for the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems <lb/>expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that <lb/>jurisdiction and those functions which are permit<lb break="no"/>ted them, either by express convention, or by a <lb/>friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. <lb/>The Consular Convention too, with his most <lb/>Christian Majesty, has stipulated in certain cases, <lb/>the aid of the National authority to his Consuls <lb/>established here. Some legislative provision is re<lb break="no"/>quisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.</p>
                <p>"The establishment of the Militia, of a Mint, <lb/>of Standards of Weights and Measures, of the <lb/>Post Office and Post Roads, are subjects which <lb/>(I presume) you will resume of course, and which <lb/>are abundantly urged by their own importance.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen of the House of Representatives</hi>, <lb/>"The sufficiency of the revenues you have es<lb break="no"/>tablished for the objects to which they are appro<lb break="no"/>priated, leaves no doubt that the residuary provi<lb break="no"/>sions will be commensurate to the other objects <lb/>for which the public faith stands now pledged. <lb/>Allow me moreover to hope, that it will be a <lb/>favourite policy with you, not merely to secure a <lb/>payment of the interest of the debt founded, but <lb/>as far and as fast as the growing resources of the <lb/>country will permit, to exonerate it of the prin<lb break="no"/>cipal itself. The appropriation you have made <lb/>of the western lands explain your dispositions on <lb/>this subject, and I am persuaded the sooner that <lb/>valuable fund can be made to contribute, along <lb/>with other means, to the actual reduction of the <lb/>public debt, the more salutary will the measure <lb/>be toe very public interest, as well as be more <lb/>satisfactory to our constituents.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen of the Senate, and House of Re<lb break="no"/>presentatives</hi>.</p>
                <p>"In perusing the various and weighty busi<lb break="no"/>ness of the present session, I indulge the fullest <lb/>persuasion that your consultations will be equally <lb/>marked with wisdom, and animated by the love <lb/>of your country. In whatever belongs to my <lb/>duty, you shall have all the co-operation which <lb/>an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It <lb/>will be happy for us both, and our best reward, <lb/>if by a successful administration of our respective <lb/>trusts, we can make the established government <lb/>more and more instrumental in promoting the <lb/>good of our fellow citizens, and more and more <lb/>the object of their attachment and confidence. <lb/>

               <pb n="6"/> The following, it is said, are the authentic <lb/>particulars of General St Clair's expedition in <lb/>America. The Miamis Indians had been for a <lb/>long time extremely troublesome to the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans, and it was determined to drive them to the <lb/>back country. General St. Clair completely ac<lb break="no"/>complished this object; but on the 22d Oct. a <lb/>detachment of 400 Americans fell in with the In<lb break="no"/>dians on the River St. Joseph, where a severe <lb/>battle was fought. Many Indians were killed, <lb/>but the Americans lost the field; several Officers, <lb/>and 150 men were killed, and they were not able <lb/>even to bring off their wounded. This success <lb/>will in all probability give the Indians new cou<lb break="no"/>rage, and induce them again to make head a<lb break="no"/>gainst the American army.</p>

                <p>A Petersburgh (Virginia) paper of the 30th <lb/>ult. informs the public of that state, that a serious <lb/>petition is now drawing up, to be presented to <lb/>the next congress, stating arguments in favour of <lb/>

The vast tracts <lb/>of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw <lb/>river are rapidly rising in value, and nothing is <lb/>wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of <lb/>slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men, <lb/>who instead of being mere lookers on, in quality <lb/>of overseers and drivers, would condescend to put <lb/>their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe, and <lb/>make this extensive territory one of the most desir<lb break="no"/>able in the habitable world.

               <lb/>"There are two articles produced in the great<lb break="no"/>est abundance on different parts adjoining James <lb/>river, the exportations of which, in the opinion of <lb/>rational men, ought to be considered as of the <lb/>greatest importance to this state. These articles <lb/>are coals, and clays for the several colours of paint, <lb/>which may be had in any quantity, and may be <lb/>afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal, <lb/>from every discovery we have been able to make, <lb/>are inexhaustible; all the samples, however, that <lb/>you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the sur<lb break="no"/>face, and there is reason to believe that the deeper <lb/>we shall descend the better will be the quality of <lb/>the coal. When once a company can be est<lb break="no"/>blished with funds sufficient to take this matter in <lb/>hand, there is no doubt but that we can supply <lb/>the different capital of the United States with <lb/>coal equally good with that from Europe, and <lb/>at a much a more moderate price than that fre<lb break="no"/>quently brought. As to our paints, there are <lb/>none better in the world, and in quantity, when <lb/>manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country <lb/>up the river, of property and enterprize, are be<lb break="no"/>ginning to turn their attention to these branches; <lb/>and with all submissions to our legislature, it is <lb/>thought that these two articles are by no means <lb/>objects beneath their attention."</p>

                <p>I had been with a number of my acquaintance <lb/>taking the diversion of a dance at an inn.

               <pb n="5"/> The Indians, on the borders of Kentucky, <lb/>continue to commit the most horrible acts of cruel<lb break="no"/>ty upon such unfortunate Americans as fall in <lb/>their power. The burning of the Miami villages, <lb/>and the destruction of their corn and vegetables, <lb/>instead of intimidating those ferocious savage, <lb/>have made them more and more vindictive and <lb/>restless; and being acquainted with all the passes <lb/>in the country, they bid defiance to their pursuers, <lb/>whom they frequently surprise and cut off.</p>

               <lb/>From Wright's Ferry we learn, that about <lb/>four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, as a boat <lb/>was coming from the East side, a most tremen<lb break="no"/>dous storm arose when she was about half way o<lb break="no"/>ver, by which means she was soon filled <lb/>with water, and sunk. there was six passengers <lb/>and the<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> in her (besides a small light <cb/>waggon and three horses, viz. a clergyman, the <lb/>owner of the waggon, with his wife and three <lb/>children; when the storm came on, the woman <lb/>and children took shelter in the waggon, but it <lb/>continued to blow with such violence that the <lb/>waggon was torn out of the boat, and the body <lb/>having by chance got loose from the carriage, <lb/>and being pretty tight, floated some distance <lb/>till its progress was stopped by a rock; the hus<lb break="no"/>band, viewing the melancholy situations of his <lb/>wife and children, resolved to relieve or perish <lb/>with them, and quitting the boat swam to the <lb/>waggon, cut open the cover with his knife, and <lb/>with difficulty kept their heads above water till <lb/>they were relieved by a boat from the West side; <lb/>by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappear<lb break="no"/>ed; the Clergyman just as he found the boat <lb/>sinking mounted his horse, one of the boatmen <lb/>mounted on one of the waggon horses, and by <lb/>this means preserved themselves till they were <lb/>relieved by a boat; the other boatman of the <lb/>name of Tim Sulivan, depending on his skill in <lb/>swimming got up an oar, but it is thought <lb/>he is drowned, as he has not since been heard <lb/>of; the boat was found in the falls, and one of <lb/>the waggon horses that had been given up for <lb/>lost, was found next day some distance below the <lb/>falls, with all his geers on, and does not appear <lb/>to have received the least injury.</p>

                <p>"One of the men who murdered the Indians <lb/>at Pine Creek, was tried on Saturday evening, <lb/>and though a number of witnesses clearly proved <lb/>the hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed, <lb/>and the confession of his counsel at the bar that <lb/>confirmed it, yet, notwithstanding an express <lb/>charge from the judges to bring him in guilty, <lb/>the jury in a few moments returned with a verdict <lb/>in his favour, and a subscription to pay the costs <lb/>of the suit, that he might be immediately set at <lb/>liberty; and all this from a most absurd idea, <lb/>which the Attorney General, with all his endea<lb break="no"/>vours, could not beat out of them, that the crime <lb/>was not the same to kill an Indian as a white <lb/>man: for some minuets the Chief Justice was mute <lb/>with astonishment.

               <hi rend="italic">Extract of a letter from a Gentleman at Kentucky,  <lb/>to a Member of the General Assembly, dated,  <lb/>Nov</hi>. 7, 1790.</p>
                <p>"I have been waiting with much impatience <lb/>to obtain some certain account of our troops; <lb/>many probably conjectures still fill the minds of the <lb/>people. A hand-bill just come to Bourbon, con<lb break="no"/>tains an extract of a letter from Governor St. <cb/>Clair to General Wilkinson, which mentions that <lb/>our army had met with but little opposition. The <lb/>Miami villages were abandoned, from thence a <lb/>detachment was sent up to St. Joseph's river, <lb/>which fell in with a party of Indians, and had a <lb/>severe engagement.</p>
                <p>"General Harmar made a shew of retreating, <lb/>and marched about eight miles, when he detached <lb/>a strong party to the field of action, in hopes of <lb/>finding the Indians on the ground; as they ex<lb break="no"/>pected, so they found them, and an action imme<lb break="no"/>diately commenced, which was obstinate on both <lb/>sides.</p>
                <p>"A vast number of Indians were killed in <lb/>crossing the St. Joseph's river. Major Fountain, <lb/>of Fayette, and General Scott's son were killed <lb/>the second fire; Capt. M'Murty and 73 militia<lb break="no"/>men were killed; Major Willis, Lieut. Fother<lb break="no"/>ingham, of the F–deral troops, and 77 privates, <lb/>also fell in the action.</p>
                <p>"General Harmar did not send a single man <lb/>to reinforce the detachment, consisting of 400 <lb/>men, (who had to sustain the fire of the whole <lb/>Indian army) although he had with him in camp <lb/>upwards of 1100 men. Our men at last lost <lb/>ground, Colonel Harding's wing was beaten, and <lb/>finally broke. Lieutenant Colonel Hall, of Bour<lb break="no"/>bon, and Majors M'Million and Willis broke the <lb/>other wing of the Indians, which occasioned the <lb/>amazing slaughter in the river St. Joseph.</p>
                <p>"General Harmar never sent to bring off the <lb/>wounded, nor bury the dead. Captain David <lb/>Thrope and Lieut. Clark fell in the field. The <lb/>Bourbon militia has suffered very much, nearly <lb/>one third of them having fallen on the spot.</p>
                <p>"The army is now at Licking, and is ex<lb break="no"/>pected home hourly.</p>
                <p>"This is the best account that I have been <lb/>able to collect; it will be delivered to you by <lb/>Major Jones, who before he leaves the district, <lb/>may be enabled to obtain further particulars."</p>

               <lb/>Intelligence has been received, that in some <lb/>trivial dispute with a native Indian, a Spaniard <lb/>has stabbed him to the heart with a stiletto, and <lb/>then fled. The nation to whom the Indian be<lb break="no"/>longed, being made acquainted with the murder, <lb/>sent a deputation to the Governor, demanding <lb/>that five Spaniards should be instantly delivered <lb/>up as an attonement. This was peremptorily re<lb break="no"/>fused, as being more than commensurate to the <lb/>offence, but the murderer was offered as a satis<lb break="no"/>faction; the Indians would not accept him singly, <lb/>and departed, vowing the severest revenge: a <lb/>few days afterwards intelligence was received that <lb/>they had surprised and massacred sixteen men, <lb/>who had been at work in the woods; and when <lb/>the vessel departed, the Spaniards were flying, <lb/>with the utmost precipitation and terror, from <lb/>all parts of the country, seeking shelter in the <lb/>forts.</p>

This day arrived the ship <lb/>Albion, John Simmons, master, in 47 days from <lb/>Rotterdam; on the 8th lying to in a heavy gale <lb/>of wind, the Albion shipped a sea, which carried <lb/>away all her boats and every loose article from <lb/>the deck; there were three men of the watch, <lb/>one of whom is washed overboard and perished– <lb/>his name is John M'Naught, and belonged to <lb/>Greenock.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Extract of a letter from a gentleman at the falls of  <lb/>the Ohio, to his relation in<supplied reason="copy blur">Winchester</supplied>, Virginia.  <lb/>dated April</hi>  13, 1791.</p>
                <p>"I wrote to you from Fort Pitt, which place <lb/>we left the 3d. inst. in company with two other <lb/>boats, and proceeded to Limestone, without <lb/>meeting or apprehending danger–at that place <lb/>we were informed of several disasters which had <lb/>befallen boats going down the river, and one to <lb/>a boat going up to a French station, loaded with <lb/>bacon, butter, &amp;c. The particulars relative to <lb/>the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked <lb/>by about 60 or 70 Indians, and the flankets that <lb/>were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. <lb/>–Immediately after firing, they gave the Indian <lb/>whoop, and rushing on the flankets, scalped them <lb/>every one (about 22)– they then fired at the <lb/>boat, but did no damage, as it required some <lb/>time to make their way into the river. After <lb/>the savages had executed this terrible act of bar<lb break="no"/>barity, they continued on the river watching for <lb/>other boats. In the course of about six days, five <lb/>or six boats happened to come down the river–the <lb/>savages attacked the foremost of them, in which <lb/>were two young ladies, of the name Macdonald, <lb/>a young gentleman, and some others, passengers, <lb/>and took it. Elevated with this easy capture, <lb/>they imagined themselves capable of taking every <lb/>boat they might fall in with–In a little time a <lb/>second boat hove in fight, which they attacked <lb/>with great fury–they were in three canoes, each <lb/>canoe containing about twenty–they moved to<lb break="no"/>wards the boat, as it came down, and commenced <lb/>firing; after discharging their guns, they retreat<lb break="no"/>ed, loading and came on a second time, fired and <lb/>repeated nine different times; as often as they <lb/>come on, there was a brisk firing kept up from <lb/>the boat, which contained nine fighting men;– <lb/>during the conflict two were killed, and five <lb/>wounded; two only remained to protect the boat, <lb/>and prevent the Indians from boarding it, which <lb/>every appearance of their conduct plainly indi<lb break="no"/>cated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves <lb/>in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the <lb/>
               <supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>, they threw billets of wood at them, and <lb/>one of them took up an ax, as a weapon of de<lb break="no"/>fence, should they persist in boarding, which the <lb/>Indians perceiving, and, as is supposed, their <lb/>ammunition being expended, they retreated, <lb/>without accomplishing their object.</p>
                <p>"These inhuman monsters, previous to their <lb/>attacking the last mentioned boat, placed the <lb/>two young ladies in front of their canoes, <lb/>in which situation they were both killed. A few <lb/>days after this transaction, they fired at another <lb/>boat, and killed one young man. In short, every <lb/>boat tat has gone down the river lately, has <lb/>been fired at, except our's. We saw no Indians; <lb/>the places where the above depredation happen<lb break="no"/>ed we passed in the night."</p>

            </p>
                <p>Yesterday morning, about one or two o'clock, <lb/>the ship Termagant, belonging to the house of <lb/>Messrs. Claggen, lying in the stream opposite <lb/>this town, was discovered on fire. The inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants of the town and the seamen in the harbour <lb/>speedily collected, but on account of a quantity <lb/>of powder that was on board, the efforts that o<lb break="no"/>therwise would have been exerted to extinguish <lb/>the flames were withholden. The first soon com<lb break="no"/>municated itself to the powder; and the explosion <lb/>was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the <lb/>houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of <lb/>the ship were flying in every direction, and it <lb/>and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting, <lb/>store and dwelling houses, on the water side, were <lb/>prevented from sharing a similar fate with the <lb/>ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse, <lb/>the property of Francis and Charles Loundes, si<lb break="no"/>tuated at some distance from the water, wherein <lb/>upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stor<lb break="no"/>ed, was several times, in different places, on fire, <lb/>ut happily extinguished without sustaining much <lb/>damage. The loss, occasioned by this alarming <lb/>element, must be great indeed, as the ship was <lb/>large and nearly new; besides, there were goods <lb/>to a considerable amount, and a pretty large sum <lb/>of money on board of her: all of which (except<lb break="no"/>ing a part of the money, which has since been <lb/>found) was destroyed. We are informed that <lb/>this accident proceeded from the steward's falling <lb/>to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cab<lb break="no"/>bin, which by some means or other, set fire to <lb/>the sails that were stowed there. It had got far <lb/>advanced before it was discovered. Providenti<lb break="no"/>ally no lives were lost.</p>
