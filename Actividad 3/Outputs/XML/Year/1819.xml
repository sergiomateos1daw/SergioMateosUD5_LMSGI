               </hi>
            </p>
                <p>By the Henry, arrived in the rive from Quebec, we <lb/>have advices from thence of the 4th September, three <lb/>days later than the last accounts. They confirm, we <lb/>regret to say, the intelligence received at Lloyd's on <lb/>Friday, of the death of the Duke of Richmond, at <lb/>Montreal, where he had arrived on his return from in<lb break="no"/>specting the new settlements in Upper Canada. His <lb/>body had been brought from Montreal to Quebec, <lb/>where it was lying in state at the time the Henry sail<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ed. His daughter Lady Mary Lennox, continued in <lb/>the most afflicting state, and great fears were entertain<lb break="no"/>ed for her recovery.</p>
                <p>Lady Sarah Lennoc, his Grace's second daughter, <lb/>is married to Major-General Sir Peregrine Maitland. <lb/>They accompanied his grace to North America, and <lb/>have remained there since he entered upon his Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. His Grace was the lineal descendant of the <lb/>first Duke of Richmond, natural son of King Charles <lb/>II. by a French Lady, who was created by his Majesty <lb/>Duchess of Portsmouth, and by Louis the Fourteenth, <lb/>Duchess of Aubigny, in France. His titles were, <lb/>Duke of Richmond, Early of March (English ho<lb break="no"/>nours) ; Duke of Aubigny, (French Honour) ; Duke <lb/>of Lennox, Early of Darnley, and Baron Methuen of <lb/>Torbulton (Scots Honours). The title of Aubigny was <lb/>confirmed in March 1816, by Louis XVIII by caus<lb break="no"/>ing the estate of Aubigny to be assigned to him, and <lb/>granting him the honours of the Louvre, as enjoyed by <lb/>his Grace's ancestors. He was a Lieutenant-General <lb/>in the army, Colonel of the 35th regiment of foot, Go<lb break="no"/>nervor of Plymouth, Governor of Upper and Lower <lb/>Canada and their dependencies, Lord Lieutenant of <lb/>the county of Sussex, and High Steward of Chichester. <lb/>–His Grace was born in 1764, succeeded his uncle, <lb/>Charles, the late Duke, in 1806, and married in 1783 <lb/>Charlotte, daughter of Duke of Gordon, by whom <lb/>he had issue seven sons and seven daughters, all of them <lb/>now living, except his third son, Henry Adam, R. N. <lb/>who fell overboard the Blake, as she was sailing into <lb/>Port Mahon, in 1812, and was drowned. His Grace <lb/>was distinguished early in life by a duel with His <lb/>Royal Highness the Duke of York. He was of an <lb/>open, candid, generous temper, and of plain and un<lb break="no"/>affected manners, qualities which were particularly con<lb break="no"/>spicuous in Ireland, when Viceroy of that country.</p>
                <p>His Grace is succeeded in the Peerage his eldest <lb/>son Charles, Earl of March, now Duke of Richmond. <lb/>This young Nobleman in the army, has seen much active ser<lb break="no"/>vice under the personal auspices of the illustrious Wel<lb break="no"/>lington, being one of his Grace's Aides-de-camp, and <lb/>was one of the Representatives in Parliament for the <lb/>City of Chichester, which seat, of course, becomes va<lb break="no"/>cant. He was lately married to the eldest daughter of <lb/>the Marquis of Anglesea, and has issue, a Son, now <lb/>Earl of March.</p>
                <p>The following is extracted from the Quebec papers:</p>
                <p>"Quebec, Thursday, Sept. 2. <lb/>"This Province has again been visited by one of <lb/>those afflicting dispensations of Providence, which by <lb/>separating by the hand of death, the ruler from the <lb/>people, covers whole communities with mourning.</p>
                <p>"An express arrived here yesterday morning from <lb/>Montreal, with the afflicting intelligence chief that his Grace <lb/>the Duke of Richmond, Governor in Chief of these <lb/>Provinces, had died on his way from Kingston to Mon<lb break="no"/>treal, at the moment that he was hourly expected to <lb/>join his family there, from which he had separated in <lb/>good health at Kingston, one the 20th, to complete by <lb/>visiting the new Settlements, the long and arduous <lb/>journey in which he has been engaged.</p>
                <p>This melancholy and utterly unexpected intelli<lb break="no"/>gence, spread with the greatest rapidity, and impressed <lb/>a deep gloom throughout the city. The flag on the <lb/>citadel, and on all the vessels in the port, was hoisted <lb/>half-mast, exhibiting every where the signals of public <lb/>mourning.</p>
                <p>"His Grace's body, immediately after his death, <lb/>was conveyed to Montreal. It reached this city last <lb/>evening in the steam-boat <hi rend="italic">Malsham</hi>, and was remov<lb break="no"/>ed this forenoon to the Castle, with the usual military <lb/>honours, and followed by his Grace's Staff, the prin<lb break="no"/>cipal Civil and Military Officers in the City and Gar<lb break="no"/>rison, and a great concourse of mourning inhabitants."</p>
                <p>September 5. <lb/>"His Grace's remains were conveyed from Montreal <lb/>to Quebec, in a steam-boat. At ten o'clock, one the <lb/>morning of the 2d of Sept. they were removed from the <lb/>vessel, and placed upon a hearse upon the King's Wharf <lb/>at Quebec, from whence it was conveyed to the Cha<lb break="no"/>teau of St. Louis, where they lay in state until four o'<lb break="no"/>clock on Saturday the 4th September, when they were <lb/>removed to the place of internment in the Cathedral <lb/>Church at Quebec.</p>
                <p>"On the corpse being brought out, the collar and <lb/>insignia of the Order of the Garter, with his Grace's <lb/>military and other appointments being placed on the cof<lb break="no"/>fin, the whole of the troops presented arms. On its being <lb/>placed on the hearse, the troops rested on their arms <lb/>reversed.</p>
                <p>"The procession then moved forward. It was com<lb break="no"/>posed of all the principals persons attached to the pub<lb break="no"/>lic, military and civil departments.</p>
                <p>"The military band filed off at the door of the Ca<lb break="no"/>thedral Church-yard and conducted it up the centre <lb/>aisle, when it was played on a platform, the mourners <lb/>remaining by the body. A signal was then given, when <lb/>the body was deposited – 15 guns being fired."</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter, dated Quebec, Sept 5 :–" When <lb/>I wrote the first side, I did not expect so soon to com<lb break="no"/>municate the melancholy event of the death of our Go<lb break="no"/>vernor, the Duke of Richmond, who was attacked on his <lb/>route from Upper Canada, with symptoms of hydro<lb break="no"/>phobia, which terminated his mortal career at six miles <lb/>from the settlement of Richmond. He was perfectly <lb/>sensible of his situation, and gave himself up from the <lb/>first spasm which attacked : it was occasioned by <lb/>a bite of a tame fox at Sorel, on his way to Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, about three months since. His death, at this <lb/>juncture, is looked on as very unfortuante for this coun<lb break="no"/>try, as he possessed the entire confidence of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and was about completing a plan of defence for <lb/>the Canadas, which, when executed, would establish a <lb/>water communication with our extreme points, per<lb break="no"/>fectly free from interruption, in case of a war with the <lb/>States."</p>
                <p>We are happy to learn, further, that no part of his <lb/>Grace's family was so dangerously ill, as was at first <lb/>reported. They are only in that situation which might <lb/>be expected, from so severe an affliction.</p>
                <p>Colonel Wilson had succeeded the late Duke of Rich<lb break="no"/>mond as Governor-General of both Canadas, being the <lb/>senior Officer on that station.</p>
                <p>Sir Charles Saxton, and Major M'Leod, Aides-de<lb break="no"/>Camp to his Grace the Duke of Richmond, have gone <lb/>to Lake Winnipeg, clothed with special powers, to in<lb break="no"/>vestigate the causes of the unhappy dissentions which <lb/>are said to have been lately renewed in that quarter <lb/>between the North West and Hudson's Bay Company. <lb/>By the new act, regulating the commercial intercourse <lb/>between the province of Upper Canada and the United <lb/>States, the duties on the importation of manufactures <lb/>and provisions from the States are considerably reduc<lb break="no"/>ed on [?] of the enumerated articles, although on <lb/>nails, snuff, manufactured tobacco, and spirits, they are <lb/>riased. The <hi rend="italic">ad-valorem[?]</hi>  duty is reduced from 10 to 5 <lb/>per cent.</p>
                <p>Buffalo, Aug. 4. <lb/>On Friday, came[?] on before the Court of King's <lb/>Beach, at Niagara, the trial of Robert Gourlay, Esq. <lb/>for a misdemeanour, in not obeying the orders of the <lb/>Magistrates at Niagara, in December last. Mr Gour<lb break="no"/>lay was found guilty, and banished the province.</p>
                <p>From the Quebec Gazette of 26th August: This <lb/>morning, about 9 o'clock, Lieut. Birch, of the royal <lb/>navy, put a period to his existence by shooting himself <lb/>through the head. We are informed that Mr Birch <lb/>had for sometime previous to his death laboured under <lb/>a melancholy state of mind. An amiable[?] wife and one <lb/>child are the survivors[?] of this awful [?] <cb/>The Annual Report of the Agricultural Society of <lb/>Quebec has been published from which it is evident <lb/>that a laudable spirit of enterprise has been awakened <lb/>in that important country. The Committee, who, in <lb/>the execution of their functions travelled through the <lb/>greater part of Lower Canada, conclude their Report by <lb/>putting on record a testimony they justly conceive to be <lb/>honourable to the character of the inhabitants of the <lb/>country through which they passed. Although many <lb/>hundreds of persons from all parts of their respective <lb/>Counties attended the Agricultural Meetings, which <lb/>were frequently of four or five hours duration, there <lb/>did not occur at any of them a single instance of in<lb break="no"/>toxication, disorderly conduct or personal altercation.</p>
                <p>The Grand Jury at Nassau, New Providence, have <lb/>brought in a bill against Sir Gregor M'Gregor, charging <lb/>him with aiding and abetting piracy, by issuing com<lb break="no"/>missions in the Bahamas, to subjects of Power in <lb/>unity[?] with Spain.</p>
                <p>A letter from Sierra Leone, dated the 9th of March <lb/>says–" It is with the deepest regret I inform you <lb/>that, notwithstanding the liberality of Great Britain, <lb/>and the faith of Treaties, the coasts swarms with slave <lb/>vessels, dragging thousnads of its miserable inhabitants <lb/>into endless captivity. A few days ago arrived here <lb/>the Union, of Liverpool : the Supercargo states, that <lb/>during his stay in the river Calabia, not less than eight <lb/>vessels, averaging 500 slaves each, had sailed for the <lb/>Spanish Colonies."</p>
                <p>We have received <hi rend="italic">Gibraltar Chronicles</hi>  to the 10th <lb/>ult. from which we learn that, in consequence of the <lb/>rapid increase of the fever at the Isle de Leon, his Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency Governor Don had issued a Proclamation on <lb/>the 2d ult. announcing that all communications with <lb/>Spain (except through the customary process of qua<lb break="no"/>tine) would close at sun-set on the following even<lb break="no"/>ing. Notice was also given to such of the labouring <lb/>classes as had not passed the fever, that they would be <lb/>provided with tents and encamped on the neutral ground <lb/>for their better security against infection should it un<lb break="no"/>happily appears in the fortress. They would not be suffered <lb/>to proceed to town, and follow their callings, during <lb/>the day, but heir return to the encampment at night <lb/>was peremptorily enjoined.</p>
                <p>We are happy to learn, however, by the latest advices <lb/>from the British fortress, that the garrison and inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants were not at all infected with the disease.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to America</hi>.</head>
                <p>In answer to the remarks which appeared in <lb/>our paper on Monday last, respecting emigration <lb/>to America, and to the statements there given <lb/>of the disadvantages which emigrants from <lb/>this country might expect to meet with, we have <lb/>received a very abusive letter from an anony<lb break="no"/>mous correspondent, who appears very angry, <lb/>and, like most other angry men, seems more <lb/>anxious to give full vent to his wrath than to as<lb break="no"/>sign any good reason for it. His first cause of <lb/>quarrel is, that we have stated the general want <lb/>of cleanliness to be a prevailing defect in the <lb/>back parts of the United States. For this we <lb/>have the authority of almost every traveller who <lb/>has visited those parts. The remarks of Birkbeck <lb/>on this point are conclu-sive and striking: –</p>
                <p>' In viewing the Americans (he observes) and <lb/>' sketching, in a rude manner, as I pass along, <lb/>' their striking characteristics, I have seen a de<lb break="no"/>' formity so general, that I cannot help esteem<lb break="no"/>' ing it national, though I know it admits of ve<lb break="no"/>' ry many individual exceptions. I have written <lb/>' it, and then erased it, wishing to pass it by, <lb/>' but it wont do – it is the truth, and to the truth <lb/>' I must adhere. Cleanliness in houses, and too <lb/>' often in person, is neglected to a degree which <lb/>' is very revolting to an Englishman.</p>
                <p>' America was bred in a cabin ; this is not a <lb/>' reproach – for the origin is most honourable ; <lb/>' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn <lb/>' logs for a framed building, and that again for <lb/>' a mansion of brick, some of her cabin habits <lb/>' have been unconsciously retained. Many have <lb/>' already been quitted, and one by one they will <lb/>' all be cleared away, as I am told they are now <lb/>' in the cities of the eastern states.</p>
                <p>' There are, I believe, court-houses, which <lb/>' are also made us of as places of worship, in <lb/>' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating <lb/>' ever since they were built. What reverence <lb/>' can be felt for the majesty of religion, or of <lb/>' the laws, in such styles of abomination ? The <lb/>' people who are content to assemble in them <lb/>' can scarcely respect each other. Here is a bad <lb/>' public example. It is said that to clean those <lb/>' places is the office of no one. But why is no <lb/>' person appointed ? Might it not be inferred <lb/>' that a disregard to the decencies of life prevails <lb/>' through such a community?'</p>
                <p>To the same purpose Cobbett complains of the <lb/>' general (for there are many exceptions) sloven<lb break="no"/>' liness about the homsteads, and particularly <lb/>' about the dwellings of labourers. Mr Birkbeck <lb/>' complains of this, and indeed what a contrast <lb/>' with the homesteads and cottages which he left <lb/>' behind him, near the exemplary spot, Guild<lb break="no"/>' ford, in Surrey.' He then proceeds to give the <lb/>reasons for this. When the first settlers took <lb/>possession of the country, the ' example of neat<lb break="no"/>' ness (he observes) was wanting. There were <lb/>' no gentlemn's gardens, kept as clean as <lb/>' drawing-rooms, with grass as even as a car<lb break="no"/>' pet. From endeavouring to imitate perfec<lb break="no"/>' tion men arrive at mediocrity ; and those who <lb/>' never have seen or heard of perfection in these <lb/>' matters, will naturally be slovens.'</p>
                <p>He afterwards remarks –</p>
                <p>' The market day at Guildford is a perfect <lb/>' show of cleanliness. Not even a carter without <lb/>' even a clean smock-frock, and closely shaven <lb/>' and clean washed face. Well may Mr Birkbeck, <lb/>' who came from this very spot, think the people <lb/>' <hi rend="italic">dirty</hi>  in the western country. I'll engage he <lb/>' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one <lb/>' family of his present neighbours, than he left <lb/>' behind upon the skins of all the people in <lb/>' the three parishes of Guildford. However, he <lb/>' would not have found this to be the case in <lb/>' Pennsylvania, and especially in those parts where <lb/>' the Quakers abound ; and, I am told, that in <lb/>' the New England States, the people are as <lb/>' cleanly and as neat as they are in England. <lb/>' The sweetest flowers, when they become pu<lb break="no"/>' trid, stink the most, and a nasty woman is the <lb/>' nastiest thing in nature.'</p>
                <p>In answer to all this, our correspondent tells <lb/>us, that the Scotch are very dirty. This, we <lb/>admit, was formerly, and may still continue in <lb/>some degree to be, the reproach of the Scotch. <lb/>But does this reasonable person mean to argue <lb/>from this, that dirty habits are amiable, and <lb/>ought not to be corrected.</p>
                <p>With regard to the difficulties of effecting a <lb/>settlement, we are borne out in our remarks on <lb/>this subject by the authority of various writers, <lb/>and principally by the autheor of the Emigrant's <lb/>Guide, a work of great merit, which combines <lb/>an extent and precision of statistical informa<lb break="no"/>tion altogether unequally, with the most enlar<lb break="no"/>ged general views of the state of the country, <lb/>both physical and moral. ' Most men (observes <lb/>' this judicious writer) on arriving in the United <lb/>' States, expects too much. Perhaps the only <lb/>' essential advantages offered are the security of <lb/>' person and property, and the cheapness of land. <lb/>' It demands excessive labour, severe economy, <lb/>' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident, to <lb/>' succeed in a newly settled country ; and it de<lb break="no"/>' mands the permanency of this continued la<lb break="no"/>' bour, prudence, and favourable circumstances.'</p>
                <p>Our anonymous correspondent is also ex<lb break="no"/>tremely displeased that we have stated so strong<lb break="no"/>ly the perincious effects produced on the gene<lb break="no"/>ral manners of the Americans by the existence <lb/>of slavery ; and he mentions that many a labour<lb break="no"/>er in this country might envy the condition of an <lb/>American slave. What are those privileges for <lb/>which a free man should envy a slave he does <lb/>not think proper to state. To show, however, <lb/>that we have not exaggerated the degradation <lb/>and oppression of the coloured class in the Unit<lb break="no"/>ed States, we shall again adduce the authority of <lb/>the Emigrant's Guide. The author is contradict<lb break="no"/>ing the notion that the labourer in the slave <lb/>States is confounded with the negroe ; and he <lb/>expresses himself in the following terms: –</p>
                <p>' A residence of 16 years in places where sla<lb break="no"/>' very is prevalent, enables us to contradict a <lb/>' general expression, that, in such places, whites, <lb/>' performing manual labour, are confounded in <lb/>' the moral estimates of the people with slaves. <lb/>' Though less respect is certainly paid to useful <lb/>' labour in the slave states than where all the <lb/>' duties are performed by whites, yet <lb/>' the distance between the two races of men are <lb/>' in all cases immense. So deep, profound, and <lb/>' inveterate is the feeling on that subject, that <lb/>' not any where in the United States can pro<lb break="no"/>' perty, sobriety, intelligence, and every other <lb/>' advantage, expect colour, raise in public opi<lb break="no"/>' nion a man the most remotely allied to the <lb/>' African, to a rank equal to the meanest white. <lb/>' Any person who resides a few years in Louisi<lb break="no"/>' ana will be witness to some very remarkable <lb/>' exemplifications of this innate contempt for all <lb/>' those who affinity involve them in the con<lb break="no"/>' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery.'</p>
                <p>What a picture is here conveyed of misery <lb/>and degradation on the one hand, and of tyranny <lb/>on the other. – Here we find it failry confessed <lb/>that no degree of worth, whether moral or intel<lb break="no"/> 
               <cb/>lectual, not even the possession of property, can <lb/>give a man the least degree of consideration in <lb/>the eyes of the privileged class. We cannot <lb/>conceive a community more wretchedly consti<lb break="no"/>tuted. All that is estimable and worthy is here <lb/>utterly contemned, because the individual who <lb/>possesses these qualities happens to have his skin <lb/>of a particular colour, and thus a merely acci<lb break="no"/>dental quality of the corporeal frame entails <lb/>upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy <lb/>and contempt. These distinctions, carried to <lb/>such an excess, seem to us to be founded on the <lb/>extinction of every generous and honourable sen<lb break="no"/>timent, and we cannot help still asserting that <lb/>we had rather live we at present are, than <lb/>in a community where such hateful antipathies <lb/>rule to the exclusion of every just and humane <lb/>feeling.</p>
                <p>With regard to the condition of the negroe <lb/>slaves we shall quote a passage from Brown's <lb/>Western Gazetteer or Emigrant's Directory <lb/>after reading which, we shall leave our anony<lb break="no"/>mous correspondent to say whether he thinks <lb/>the condition of a labourer in this country pre<lb break="no"/>ferable to that of being an African slave. The <lb/>writer, describing the town of Lexington, in <lb/>Kentucky, observes –</p>
                <p>' In this square stands the market-house, <lb/>' which is of brick, and well furnished on Wed<lb break="no"/>' nesdays and Saturdays ; but occasionally the <lb/>' scene of a barbarous practise ; for it is here <lb/>' that incorrigible or delinquent negroes are <lb/>' flogged unmercifully. I saw this punishment <lb/>' inflicted on two of these wretches. Their <lb/>' screams soon collected a numerous crowd ; I <lb/>' could not help saying to myself, " These cries <lb/>' are the knell of Kentucky libery.' "</p>
                <p>Having made this answer to the angry charges <lb/>thus brought against us, we have only to dis<lb break="no"/>claim, in the strongest terms, all hostility or pre<lb break="no"/>judice against the Americans. We have no <lb/>wish either to depreciate their character or in<lb break="no"/>stitutions. They exhibit the interesting spectacle <lb/>of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace <lb/>to wealth and greatness. To revile such a <lb/>people would be the height of human folly, and <lb/>equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to <lb/>take offence because endeavour to make a <lb/>fair estimate of their character, without hiding <lb/>any of its defects.</p>

                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Lord Selkirk vs. North West Company</hi>.</p>
                <p>On Friday, the 30th of October, the Court of Oyer <lb/>and Terminer proceeded to try the gentlemen accused <lb/>as necessaries to the murder of Robert Semple, Esq. <lb/>and others at Red River, on the 19th of June, 1816 <lb/>and the trial was rendered extremely interesting by the <lb/>disclousure which took place of many extraordinary cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances connected with the Hudson's Bya and <lb/>North West Companies, which for some time past has <lb/>excited so much of the public attention in this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince. The gentlemen tried on this occasion were, <lb/>Messrs. Alexander Mackenzie, <lb/>Hugh M'Gillis, <lb/>Simon Fraser, <lb/>John Macdonald, and <lb/>John M'Laughlin <lb/>} accused as accessories <lb/>after the fact. <lb/>and Mr John Severlight, accused as an accessory <hi rend="italic">before </hi>
               <lb/>and <hi rend="italic">after</hi>  the fact.</p>
                <p>It appeared in evidence that the North West Com<lb break="no"/>pany had been upwards of thirty years in possession <lb/>of trading posts called <hi rend="italic">forts</hi>  at different points on the <lb/>Red River in the Indian Territories, and it is well <lb/>known that for a century before the North West Com<lb break="no"/>pany, the Canadian for traders had been in the con<lb break="no"/>stant practise of resorting to that country which was <lb/>visited for the first time by traders of the Hudson's <lb/>Bay Company about twenty-five years ago. It was <lb/>put in evidence that for many years afterwards both <lb/>companies carried on their trade to Red River without <lb/>interference in each others pursuits, and without any <lb/>disturbance in the country ; and it was explained that <lb/>the principal object of the trade being to collect pro<lb break="no"/>visions, (enlisting chiefly of the dried flesh of the buf<lb break="no"/>falo, which abound in the plains) and the country pro<lb break="no"/>ducing abundance for the supply of both parties, the <lb/>same causes of dissention did not exist as at trading <lb/>stations where the fine furs are obtained in small quan<lb break="no"/>tities, and where rival traders would at all times be <lb/>likely to dispute about the divisions of them. The Red <lb/>River country therefore remained quiet and undisturb<lb break="no"/>ed until the arrival of the Earl of Selkirk's Colonists <lb/>and Servants, and the attempts made by their leaders <lb/>to prevent the usual supplies of provisions from being <lb/>obtained by the traders.</p>
                <p>The proclamation of Miles Macdonnell the soi-dis<lb break="no"/>ant <hi rend="italic">Governor of Ossinibour</hi>, prohibiting the exporta<lb break="no"/>tion of provisions from Red River, was the first docu<lb break="no"/>ment produced for the defence at the recent trials. It <lb/>was proved that, under this assumed authority, several <lb/>acts of violence were committed by Mr Macdonnell and <lb/>his followers. Trading posts and buildings were for<lb break="no"/>cibly entered, depots of provisions seized, the river (the <lb/>only outlet from the country) blockaded by batteries <lb/>mounted with cannon, and the trade of the North <lb/>West Company wholly interdicted, before any acts of <lb/>retaliation were attempted on their part, and even be<lb break="no"/>fore they took any precautions for their own defence <lb/>or for ensuring the safety of their provisions, on which <lb/>depended the existence of their trade, and the lives of <lb/>their people.</p>
                <p>Mutual and continual acts of aggression and ret<lb break="no"/>aliation appeared to have exasperated the minds of both <lb/>parties, and to have rendered them so suspicious of the <lb/>designs of each other as to be always on their guard <lb/>and prepared for defence. In short it appeared in <lb/>evidence that the country remained in a state of pri<lb break="no"/>vate war, which at length ended in the <hi rend="italic">battle</hi>  of the <lb/>loch of Jane, 1816. The particulars of this unfort<lb break="no"/>unate affray were fully investigated in the trial of Bouche <lb/>and Brown for murder, as <hi rend="italic">principals</hi>. The state<lb break="no"/>ments on both sides are already before the public, and <lb/>the acquittal of the prisoners shows sufficiently that the <lb/>jury considered Mr Semple and his party to have been <lb/>the assailants. On the trial of the alleged accessories <lb/>the cirumstances which led to the meeting of the hos<lb break="no"/>tile parties were made out in the evidence to the following <lb/>effect, viz : –</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">March</hi>, 1816, Mr Colin Robertson, with an <lb/>armed party, acting under the orders of <hi rend="italic">Governor </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">Semple</hi>, who had succeeded <hi rend="italic">Governor</hi>  Miles Macdonnell <lb/>at Red River, captured by surprise the North West <lb/>trading post at the forks of the river, called <hi rend="italic">Fort </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">Gibraltar</hi>, and took possession of all the stores and <lb/>provisions. In the latter part of the following month <lb/>of May, Governor Semple caused the buildings (which <lb/>were of wood) to be taken to pieces, and the materials <lb/>were floated fown the river in rafts, to be used in con<lb break="no"/>structing his new fort, which he called <hi rend="italic">Fort Douglas </hi>
               <lb/>and where, (following the examples of his predecessors) <lb/>he mounted cannon to command the passage of the <lb/>river, built an armed schooner, or gun-boat, to com<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>plete the blockage, and effectually to intercept the pro<lb break="no"/>visions and trade of the North West Company. Mr. <lb/>Alexander Macdonnell, a partner of the North West <lb/>Company, who had charge of their provisions at Ri<lb break="no"/>viere Qui Appele, one of the branches of the Red River, <lb/>became alarmed at these measures of hostility, and as<lb break="no"/>sembled as many people as he could (half breeds and <lb/>others) for the protection of the property under his care, <lb/>with which, at the usual time, he proceeded down the <lb/>river till he arrived within sixty miles of Governor <lb/>Semple's fort. He then landed his provisions, made <lb/>dispositions to defend them, if attacked, and sent a <lb/>party of his people, with a temporary supply to meet <lb/>the canoes from below, apprise them of the blockages, <lb/>and concert with them the means of eluding or re<lb break="no"/>moving it. This party, under the direction of Cuth<lb break="no"/>bert Grant (a half breed, and a clerk of the N. West <lb/>Company) was ordered to land above Fort Douglas <lb/>in order to keep out of the reach of the cannon, and <lb/>to carry these provisions in carts, at as great a distance <lb/>as possible from the fort, so as to avoid being seen.– <lb/>This it was fully proved they did ; but a swamp in the <lb/>rear of the fort compelled them to pass within about <lb/>two miles of it, and being deserted and pursued from <lb/>then, the conflict ensued in which Mr Semple, and <lb/>most of his party, were killed.</p>
                <p>It was further made out in evidence that in the <lb/>Spring of the year 1816, the agent of the North West <lb/>Company at Montreal were still in need of more than <lb/>the usual supply of provisions from the Red River, be<lb break="no"/>cause there had not yet been time to replace the ves<lb break="no"/>sels on the lakes, and the other means of transport <lb/>which the Americans had destroyed during the war, <lb/>nor to replenish their stores at Fort William, with the <lb/>usual quantity of provisions from Canada. Having <lb/>also heard of the seizure of one of their posts at Red <lb/>River in the fall of the year 1815, and apprehending <lb/>further aggressions in the spring, Mr M'Leod, one of <lb/>the agents, with all the partners and clerks who could <lb/>be spared from Montreal, proceeded up the country <lb/>early in the Spring, and on arriving at Fort William, <lb/>received intelligence of the capture of Fort Gibraltar <lb/>and the blockade of Red River, towards which place <lb/>he immediately proceeded with as many of the part<lb break="no"/>ners, clerks, and servants of the Company as he could <lb/>collect by the way, in order to rescue the intercepted <lb/>provisions, in the defence of which, or in their own <lb/>defence, if fired on by Semple's blockading battery, it <lb/>was their avowed purpose to use force if necessary, but <lb/>it was distinctly proved that their intentions and orders <lb/>issued to their cannonmen, were, to pass Fort Douglas <lb/>singing, and to proceed up the river for their provi<lb break="no"/>sions, without landing or molesting any one unless <lb/>they should be attacked.–They arrived at Red River <lb/>three days after the battle, and Mr M'Leod, who was <lb/>a Magistrate, being of opinion that Mr Semple's party <lb/>had been the assailants, and that the half breeds had <lb/>only acted in self defence, did not adopt any measures <lb/>against them, (the half breeds) but, on the contrary, <lb/>expressed approbation for their having defended their <lb/>provisions, and gave them the supplies of clothing, &amp;c. <lb/>usually given to all the servants of the North West <lb/>Company, while, at the same time, he arrest some <lb/>of the survivors of Mr Semple's party, and served sub<lb break="no"/>poenas upon others to give evidence of these transactions <lb/>in the Courts of Lower Canada. <cb/>This was the whole of the evidence, and the only <lb/>circumstances which appeared relative to the prisoners, <lb/>were that Mr Sevewright (the alleged accessory before <lb/>the fact) was with Mr Alexander Macdonnell when he <lb/>sent off Grant and his party to escort the provisions <lb/>past Fort Douglas, and that the alleged accessaries <lb/>after the fact arrived at Red River with Mr M'Leod, <lb/>after the battle was over, and appeared to consider it, <lb/>as it is now found to have been, an affray in which the <lb/>unsuccessful party were to blame, and in which the <lb/>successful party <hi rend="italic">were not murderers</hi> –The Judge who <lb/>presided at the trial, declared in his charge to the jury <lb/>that there was not a <hi rend="italic">scintilla</hi>  of evidence " against any <lb/>one of these gentlemen," and the jury accordinagly re<lb break="no"/>turned a verdict of <hi rend="italic">Not Guilty</hi>.</p>
                <p>It will be recollected that these gentlemen were ar<lb break="no"/>rested by the Earl of Selkirk, at Fort William, in Aug <lb/>1815, on the charges of High Treason and Conspi<lb break="no"/>racy, as well as Murder–and that the buildings and <lb/>property of the North West Company at that place <lb/>were forcibly seized and subsequently retained by an <lb/>armed force under his Lordship's command. The <lb/>North West Company represented at the time that these <lb/>accusations were merely a pretext set up to palliate the <lb/>preconcerted plunder of their property, and destruction <lb/>of their trade, while, on the part of Lord Selkirk, it <lb/>was alleged that the crimes committed by the partners <lb/>of the North West Company were so atrocious, as to <lb/>justify his Lordship's proceedings against them ; and <lb/>for some time the public opinion remained in suspense <lb/>as to the real merits of the case. So far as regarded <lb/>the seizure of property and the interruption of trade, <lb/>the point was decided by the Prince Regent's Procla<lb break="no"/>mation of the 3rd of May, 1817, in consequence of <lb/>which the North West Company recovered possession <lb/>of their property, and re-established their trade ; but <lb/>that proclamation left the rights of parties, and the <lb/>crimes alleged against the individuals, to be investigated <lb/>and decided upon by the law – and until such investi<lb break="no"/>gation could take place, much uncertainty necessarily <lb/>prevailed from the contradictory statements and affida<lb break="no"/>vits which had been laid before the public.</p>
                <p>The recent trials at York however decided the <lb/>point as to the alleged <hi rend="italic">murders</hi>, and the charge of <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">High Treason</hi>  has never been followed up, nor ever <lb/>mentioned, since it served the desired purpose, by <lb/>figuring in Lord Selkirk's Warrant as a pretext for <lb/>seizing and examining the books and private papers of <lb/>of the North West Company.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Reform in Upper Canada</hi>
            </p>
                <p>It has been already mentioned that Governor <lb/>Maitland, on opening the session of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature of Upper Canada, recommended that mea<lb break="no"/>sures should be taken to prevent the meeting <lb/>of delegates for obtaining reform in Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>da. Accounts from Quebec and Montreal, da<lb break="no"/>ted the end of November, state, that in pursu<lb break="no"/>ance of this recommendation, the Legislature, <lb/>on one of the first days of its meeting, appoint<lb break="no"/>ed a Committee to inquire into the subject, who <lb/>almost instantly came to the following resolu<lb break="no"/>tion</p>
                <p>Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Committee that <lb/>some such legislative provision should be enacted as the wis<lb break="no"/>dom of the Imperial Parliament has found it proper to pro<lb break="no"/>vide to meet similar occasions, to put it out of the power of <lb/>any designing persons to organize discontent.</p>
                <p>The proceeding appears to have raised the in<lb break="no"/>dignation of the Gourlay or reforming party in <lb/>Upper Canada, as will be seen by the following <lb/>extract :–</p>
                <p>Montreal, November 21. <lb/>This legislative provision, it will be immediate<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ly perceived, is the suspension of the Habeas <lb/>Corpus act, for that was the course pursued in <lb/>England. We do not believe that there is the <lb/>most remote necessity for such a measure. We <lb/>do not hesitate to say, that the members have <lb/>not spoken the sentiments of heir constituents, <lb/>in their echo of Sir P. Maitland's speech, with <lb/>the most humiliating servility ; and we feel con<lb break="no"/>vinced that it will not be borne with by the <lb/>people, while they have the control in any way <lb/>of their representatives. The sentiment therein <lb/>attempted to be disseminated is an <pb/>libel on the truly loyal people of Upper Canada. <lb/>It would sound in our ears like the knell of their <lb/>liberty, if we were not persuaded, that its adop<lb break="no"/>tion would provoke a spirit of resistance, not <lb/>corporal, but mental ; not secret and illegal, but <lb/>open and legitimate, which (if the Administra<lb break="no"/>tion do not take the decision of the question <lb/>from the people by force, and we believe they <lb/>cannot nor dare not) will serve to purge the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the united province from the injury <lb/>which it has received by mal-administration.</p>

The gentlemen present immediately <lb/>afterwards unanimously agreed to give to the doubloun <lb/>the value of 4l and to the sovereigh the value 1l, 2s. <lb/>6d. currency.

            </p>
                <p>A bill of indictment, for a conspiracy to ruin the <lb/>trade of the North West Company, and impoverish the <lb/>partnes thereof, was found by the Grand Jury, against <lb/>Thomas Douglas, Early of Selkirk ; J. B. Chevalier de <lb/>Lorimer, Captain in his Majesty's Indian Department ; <lb/>Captain Pratais D'Orsonnens, late of the De Meuron <lb/>Regiment ; Captain Frederick Matthey, ditto ; Lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant G.

Fauche, ditto ; Lieutenant Frederick <lb/>Graffenrad, ditto ; Serjeant Jacob Vichie, ditto ; Cap<lb break="no"/>tain Miles Macdonnel, late of the Canadian Fecibles ; <lb/>Lieutenant Alexander Bridport Beecher, late of the <lb/>Royal Navy ; Doctor John Allen, John Spencer, Do<lb break="no"/>nald Macpherson, James Chatelain, John M'Nab, Ar<lb break="no"/>chibald Macdonald, and John P. Bourke.</p>
                <p>The indictment contains three counts ; and amongst <lb/>the numerous overt acts therein set forth, support<lb break="no"/>ed by documentary and oral evidence, the following <lb/>were particularly prominent :– The engaging and ar<lb break="no"/>mind a number of disbanded soldiers (foreigners) ; the <lb/>entry of them, by force of arms, into Fort William, <lb/>in August, 1816 ; retaining possession of the fort till <lb/>May 1817 ; sending off as prisoners the partners of <lb/>the North West Company found there ; getting rid of <lb/>the clerks, by subpoenas to appear at York at a period <lb/>when no courts are held there, without ever inquiring <lb/>whether they know anything of the matters to which <lb/>the subpoenas related, and without ever bringing them <lb/>forward afterwards ; stopping of the outfits from going <lb/>into the interior, and the returns from coming into <lb/>Montreal ; possessing themselves of all the books and <lb/>papers of the concern ; sending away the principal <lb/>clerk under a charge of felony, without examination, <lb/>and without having ever followed up the charge ; the <lb/>pretended sale, by Daniel Mackenzie, of the North <lb/>West property, obtained by his Lordship by means of <lb/>continued duress ; tampering with, and debauching the <lb/>North West Company's servants, and commanding <lb/>them in the King's name ; writing circular letters to <lb/>the partners and clerks in the interior country, advis<lb break="no"/>ing them to abandon their trust, alleging that the <lb/>North West Company were ruined, and to carry the <lb/>furs to Hudson's Bay ; taking possession of Fort Lake <lb/>La Pluie, and the property there, and stopping the na<lb break="no"/>vigation, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Upon this being returned a true bill the Attorney<lb break="no"/>General moved the process of the Court against the <lb/>parties ; and Dr Allen being present, was to be ar<lb break="no"/>raigned the following day.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Wm Smith v. The Earl of Selkirk</hi>
            </p>
                <p>This was a civil action brough by Mr Wm Smith <lb/>against Lord Selkirk for false imprisonment.</p>
                <p>It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was under<lb break="no"/>sheriff of the Western District, and as such, the bear<lb break="no"/>er of a writ of restitution founded upon a verdict of a <lb/>special jury at Sandwich, in October 1816, and grant<lb break="no"/>ed by the Magistrate, ordering the restoration of Fort <lb/>William to the North West Company. He was also <lb/>the bearer of a warrant, for felony, issued against his <lb/>Lordship, Dr Allen, Captain Matthey, and others, u<lb break="no"/>pon an information upon oath before a justice of the <lb/>Peace. Mr Smith got to Fort William on the 19th of <lb/>March 1817, and produced his writ of restitution, <lb/>with which his Lordship refused to comply ; and when <lb/>the Earl and others were arrested by Mr Smith, upon <lb/>the warrant for felony, his Lordship laid hold of him <lb/>and pushed him out of doors ; and he was afterwards <lb/>kept in close custody in the fort under a military guard. <lb/>A circumstance which added much to the grievous na<lb break="no"/>ture of the offence, and which was particularly dwelt <lb/>upon by the Judge, in his charge to the Jury, was, that <lb/>whilst Mr Smith was kept in a rigorous confinement, <lb/>Charles de Reinhard, though under an accusation of <lb/>was at large and keeping a school, though no<lb break="no"/>minally under the surveillance of one or two of his for<lb break="no"/>mer comrades. The Chief Justice also remarked upon a<lb break="no"/>nother part of the evidence for the defence, by which <lb/>it appeared that the only option left to Mr Smith to ob<lb break="no"/>tain his liberty was that of abandoning his duty, and <lb/>breaking his oath of office, by a promise not to molest <lb/>Lord Selkirk. Mr Smith, however, notwithstanding <lb/>this proposal, persisted in doing his duty, and was not <lb/>liberated until the evacuation of Fort William by his <lb/>Lordship and his forces in May, 1818.</p>
                <p>The Jury after some deliberation, returned a verdict <lb/>in favour of the plaintiff.– Damages L.500 Halifax <lb/>currency.</p>
                <p>After narrating the military parages, &amp;c. at Rich<lb break="no"/>mond, in America, in honour of the 22d of February, <lb/>a journal says, " A melancholy catastrophe closed the <lb/>day. Colonel W. Tatham, so well known in England <lb/>and this country, for his acquaintance with civil engi<lb break="no"/>neering.–who has been residing in this city for two or <lb/>three years, but whose utility was considerably arrested <lb/>by an unfortunate habit to which he had become ad<lb break="no"/>dicted–was destined on that day to breathe his last.– <lb/>In a moment of intemperance, as he stood by the piece <lb/>of artillery which was firing the evening salute, he ex<lb break="no"/>claimed that he wished to die. As the second gun was <lb/>about to fire, and immediately after the commanding <lb/>had given the word " Fire!" Conolonel Tatham <lb/>presented himself in front of the muzzle of the piece, <lb/>and by its discharge his abdomen was almost literally <lb/>blown to pieces. His body was raised a few feet in the <lb/>air by the explosion, and he fell upon his face without <lb/>uttering one word that was heard by the byestanders.– <lb/>Colonel Tatham died without any family. Circum<lb break="no"/>stances had strip life of much of its attractions in his <lb/>eyes ; but it is impossible not to regard the manner of <lb/>his death with horroer, and to feel the deepest commi<lb break="no"/>seraton for his melancholy fate. He was a man of <lb/>great information, of great genius, and of great re<lb break="no"/>source of mine. But to this melancholy end he has <lb/>arrived."</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Leeds, </hi>
               <hi rend="italic">April</hi>  19.–We have been somewhat alarmed here <lb/>to-day, though no bad consequences have followed, by a most <lb/>numerous assemblage of croppers, cloth-dressers, and other <lb/>artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep com<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ing in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley, Arm<lb break="no"/>ley, Holbeck, and all the neighbouring towns and villages <lb/>and it is computed that at one time there were full three <lb/>thousand of these distressed people assembled, chiefly in Brig<lb break="no"/>gate. As many of them marched into the town with great <lb/>sticks in their hands, they created some little alarm, but their <lb/>conduct was uniformly peaceable; their complaints were not <lb/>loud, though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and <lb/>Magistrates, with the whole of the Civil Power, were in rea<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>diness to act as circumstances might require; but, fortunately, <lb/>there was not the slightest occasion for their interference. <lb/>By far the greater number of the assemblage dispersed by noon, <lb/>and returned to their respective homes. Several respectable <lb/>gentlemen went among them, to ascertain the motives of <lb/>their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it does not ap<lb break="no"/>pear that they have the least disposition to commit any breath <lb/>of the peace ; but in fact, the people know not what to do <lb/>in their present state of distress. I understand that an active <lb/>subscription is going, to enable a number of these poor <lb/>men to proceed to Canada; and others are said to have ex<lb break="no"/>pressed their wish to be sent to Botany Bay, provided they <lb/>can obtain the sanction of Government. The case of these <lb/>people is a very perplexing one ; for their numbers augment <lb/>daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Chester, </hi>
               <hi rend="italic">April</hi>  19.–John Bagguely, John Drummond <lb/>and Samuel Johnson, convicted of sedition on the 15th inst., <lb/>were this day, after an adrdress from the Chief-Justice (Mr <lb/>Serjeant Copley,) sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and <lb/>to find security for their good behaviour for two years, each <lb/>in L.500 himself with sureties in L.100 each.</p>
                <p>We are sorry to hear that great number of the agricultu<lb break="no"/>ral poor are out of employ in Monmouthshire, and that the <lb/>amount of wages diminishes as works get scarcer. Emigra<lb break="no"/>tion to America still continues; but it is, for the most part, of <lb/>a description of person who have afforded employ to others <lb/>rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some <lb/>property with them.</p>
                <p>Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States, there <lb/>are twenty six persons belonging to one family, (Quakers, of <lb/>the name of Thistlewaith,) lately residing in Meadow lane, <lb/>Leeds. These industrious and enterprising individuals are <lb/>gone with an intention of carrying on the woollen manufac<lb break="no"/>ture (in conjunction with others) on an extensive scale, ei<lb break="no"/>ther at Philadelphia or some other more eligible site in its <lb/>vicinity. Several other families are preparing to emigrate <lb/>from the same neighbourhood, as well as from Dewsbury, <lb/>Bradford, and other places in the vicinity. It is true these <lb/>extensive emigrations may, in some degree, contribute to re<lb break="no"/>lieve our overburdened population ; but they must likewise <lb/>tend, in an equal ratio, to impoverish the nation ; as every <lb/>individual and family who emigrate, setting aside the pecu<lb break="no"/>niary wealth they carry with them, take what is of far more <lb/>consequence to a commercial nation–their talents and in<lb break="no"/>dustry–articles, at present, of comparative small value in the <lb/>country.</p>
                <p>The very heavy impost which is at present levied upon au<lb break="no"/>thors and publishers, by being compelled, under the existing <lb/>Copyright Act to deliver eleven copies of every book publish<lb break="no"/>ed to certain public libraries, is likely to be repealed by a Bill <lb/>to be brought into Parliament in a few days. The body of <lb/>evidence taken before the Select Committe of the House of <lb/>Commons last year, forms a most interesting display of the <lb/>state of literary property in this country.</p>
                <p>Saturday last Mr Stuart and Mr Allsop were returned for <lb/>the Borough of Camelford.</p>
                <p>Yesterday, the Grand Jury for the County of Middlesex <lb/>found two Bills of Indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury <lb/>against five of the principal witnesses produced in behalf of <lb/>the petitioner, who were examined before the Select Com<lb break="no"/>mittee appointed to try the merits of the election fo Penrhyn.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Extraordinary Legacy.</hi> –A very singular cause is now de<lb break="no"/>pending before the Court of Session in Scotland, respecting a <lb/>legacy to the amount of upwards of <hi rend="italic">fifty thousand pounds,</hi> be<lb break="no"/>queathed by the late Earl of F. (who died at Berlin) to a fo<lb break="no"/>reigner, who was one of his domestic servants. The payment <lb/>of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the late Earl, <lb/>on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consi<lb break="no"/>deration ; and from its novelty the case is, of course, the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of much conversation in the Northern Metropolis. The <lb/>arguments and pleadings in this extraordinary suit, in which <lb/>the most eminent counsel of the Edinburgh Bar are engaged, <lb/>display much classical as well as legal learning ; but no judg<lb break="no"/>ement has yet been pronounced by the Court. From the mag<lb break="no"/>nitude of the sum in dispute, it will probably be finally de<lb break="no"/>termined by an appeal to the House of Lords.– <hi rend="italic">Morn. Chron.</hi>

               <hi rend="italic">Town Hall, Southwark.</hi> –Thomas Wing was brought up by <lb/>Reeve, the Marshalman, and examined before Sir John Earner[?], <lb/>the sitting Magistrate, charged on suspicion of robbing his em<lb break="no"/>ployers, Messrs Sentance and Flint, grocers, NO. 300. Borough, <lb/>High-street.</p>
                <p>The prisoner's detection was caused in the following singu<lb break="no"/>lar manner :–He was porter to the prosecutors, and was fre<lb break="no"/>quently about the shop ; a large house dog having seen him <lb/>take money from the till, which he tied in his pocket hand<lb break="no"/>kerchief, followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a <lb/>shed near the stables, and then he came into the shop and ap<lb break="no"/>peared quite restless, pulling every person by the skirt[?] and <lb/>apparently wishing them to follow him. At length Henry <lb/>Heydon, the apprentice, having occasion to go to the stable, <lb/>the dog followed him, and having drawn his attention to the <lb/>heap of rubbish, under which the money was buried, began to <lb/>scratch at it till he brought the booty to view ! The appren<lb break="no"/>tice brought it to his master, who counted, and found it to <lb/>contain 12s. in copper coin. After marking it he desired the <lb/>boy to place it in the same spot, which he did, and soon af<lb break="no"/>terwards, finding that it was removed, he asked the prisoner <lb/>some questions about it, but he declared his ignorance of the <lb/>whole transaction. Reeve, the Marshalman, was then sent <lb/>for, who, on searching the prisoner, found some of the marked <lb/>ballpence[?] in his pocket.–Remanded. <cb/>
               <hi rend="italic">Bank Committee.</hi> –The Opposition Journals, last wek, as<lb break="no"/>serted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House of <lb/>Commons intend to report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of <lb/>paying in specie. That is, the Bank shall pay next January <lb/>in gold bars at the present price of gold, L.4 1s. per ounce, <lb/>any quanitity of notes not being less than sixty or a hundred <lb/>pounds' worth, and that in two years afterwards they shall <lb/>pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold, L.3, 17s. <lb/>10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's plan goes farther. It re<lb break="no"/>commends that the Bank shall never pay in coin, but in bars <lb/>of gold, at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall <lb/>at all times buy gold, when offered, at L.3, 17s. and sell it, <lb/>when demanded, at L.3, 17s. 10 1/2d.</p>
                <p>If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the <lb/>Restriction Committee intend to report in favour of payments <lb/>in bullion at the market price ; and should Parliament adopt <lb/>that plan ; then there will be a very great saving to the na<lb break="no"/>tion in the expense of coinage, the waste of, &amp;c. All <lb/>the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in fo<lb break="no"/>reign commerce, will be answered as well by payments in gold <lb/>bars as by payments in coins, and the danger of a domestic run <lb/>on the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic, as in 1797, <lb/>will be completely prevented. This is, indeed, at all times, <lb/>the only danger to which it is exposed. A run for coin on <lb/>the Country Banks would instantly fall on the Bank of England, <lb/>and would cramp, if not dry up,the currency throughout the <lb/>empire, producing the greatest confusion. Now, if the Op<lb break="no"/>position Journals be correct, the currency will be placed in <lb/>perfect security, at perfect ease. Nothing will be able to dis<lb break="no"/>order it. If persons will hoard specie, they must purchase <lb/>gold bars or foreign coin, or content themselves with silver.</p>
                <p>In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the <lb/>amount of L.800,000 each year, and then the value of gold <lb/>was rather below the standard price. In the year 1817 we <lb/>imported to the amount of six millions, and in the year 1818 <lb/>we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. Du<lb break="no"/>ring the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have <lb/>an abundant harvest or two, and little importation of corn <lb/>become necessary, gold will again fall very low. The Bank <lb/>will then be able to pay, to buy gold to the full extent of Mr <lb/>Ricardo's plan, and to place their notes on a firm, unques<lb break="no"/>tionable foundation. The finances of the continent, and of <lb/>the world, indeed–the sources and circulation of money will, <lb/>during peace, gradually become steadier and better known. <lb/>The East Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quan<lb break="no"/>tity of specie, while Spanish America, in consequence of her <lb/>troubles, yields far less than usual. It would be madness to <lb/>fly in the face of all these circumstances, by compelling the <lb/>Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may be desirable to li<lb break="no"/>mit the issue of bank notes to some certain, yet liberal amount. <lb/>We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the Committee ; <lb/>but, if some rumours be true, we augur favourably of it. It[?] <lb/>is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee, and stood alone in <lb/>voting against the Report. Thus, then, the Report cannot be <lb/>in favour of a very sudden or decided plan for the resumpion <lb/>of cash payments, or Mr Tierney would not have voted against <lb/>it ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable prospect of a rational <lb/>scheme for that resumption, or the other five or six Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion Members of the Committee would not have voted for it. <lb/>– <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Grand Pigeon Match</hi>, three Gentlemen of the Midgham <lb/>Club, against thrice of All England, took place on Monday on <lb/>Farnham Downs, at twenty-one birds, twenty-one yards dis<lb break="no"/>tance from the gun, for 150 guineas aside, charge unlimited. <lb/>Messrs Adams, Russel and Holt, were selected from the Crack <lb/>Club against Messrs King, Short and Keans. The sports were <lb/>as follows ; Mr Adams killed nineteen birds, and the remain<lb break="no"/>ing two were severely hit. Russel killed eighteen, but lost <lb/>one three yards out of bounds, and Mr Holt bagged sixteen, <lb/>making a grand total of fifty-two from sixty-three. The Club <lb/>was at first backed to win, but the England shots were now <lb/>backed freely at six to four, as they were considered safe <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">eighteen</hi>  bird men. Mr King killed twenty, but lost two out <lb/>of bounds. Short missed his first three, which brought bet<lb break="no"/>ting to two to one onn the Club, but he killed the next seven<lb break="no"/>teen, and missed the last bird. Mr Keans had seventeen to <lb/>tie, and eighteen to win, and he was back at five to four <lb/>and at two to one, after killing eleven birds in succession. <lb/>He, however, missed the seventeenth, and had to kill the o<lb break="no"/>ther four to win. He succeeded, and the prize was won by once <lb/>bird. It was altogether the most interesting match of this <lb/>sort known for years.</p>
                <p>Letters from Petersburgh, of the 15th ultimo, mention that <lb/>Prince Gustavus of Sweden, son of King Gustavus IV., has <lb/>obtained permission from the Emperor, his uncle, to proceed <lb/>to England, for the purpose of completing his studies at Ox<lb break="no"/>ford. Reports speak highly of the virtues and talents of this <lb/>unfortunate young Prince, who excites universal interest and <lb/>sympathy in the north of Europe. In these feelings we must <lb/>largely share, for we cannot easily forget the associations with <lb/>which the name of <hi rend="italic">Vasa</hi>  was connected, not the services ren<lb break="no"/>dered by two Sovereigns of that Illustrious House to the cause <lb/>of civil and religious liberty. It is said that a great Potentate, <lb/>whose generosity and magnanimity are proverbial, has settled <lb/>upon Prince Gustavus an allowance of L. 2,000 Sterling per <lb/>annum, during the residence of the latter in England, and that <lb/>on the return of his Royal Highness to the Continent he is <lb/>to espouse his cousin, a Princess of Hesse Cassel, who, if ru<lb break="no"/>mour be correct, has lately refused a matrimonial alliance <lb/>with the new Swedish dynasty.</p>
                <p>Papers arrivedon Saturday from New York and Boston to <lb/>the 15th ult. The National Intelligencer, in an article occu<lb break="no"/>pying five columns, under the head of "Strictures on Mr La<lb break="no"/>cock's Report on the Seminole War," defends the sanguinary <lb/>proceedings of General Jackson. This production is said to <lb/>have excited a great sensation throughout the United States, <lb/>being supposed to express the sentiments of the Executive. <lb/>The General had left Washington for his residence in Tenes<lb break="no"/>see. By an arrival from Aux Cayes, intelligence was stated <lb/>to be received that Sir G M'Gregor's troops had deserted <lb/>him, owing to the want of funds for their subsistence.</p>

                <p>Some Canada papers to the 11th let. have arrived in <lb/>town. Sir Peregrine Maitland had summoned the <lb/>Parliament of Upper Canada to meet him at York, on <lb/>the 22d of April. He had appointed Port Talbot in <lb/>the town of Dunwich, a port of entry, in the same <lb/>manner as those established between Canada and the <lb/>United Statess.</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter to a Gentleman in George-town, <lb/>dated Tobago, Feb. 9. 1819.–' The heavy rains <lb/>which continued during the months of December and <lb/>January, almost inundated the country, which brought <lb/>on a most rapid and fatal disease, which made its first <lb/>appearance in the frost, at a short distance from the <lb/>town, consisting of 212 men strong, and in 10 or 12 <lb/>days, 45 of that number were numbered with the dead. <lb/>The contagion was so rapid, that it soon spread into <lb/>the town, shipping, and country, and proved equally <lb/>fatal. The disorder was such, it baffled all medical <lb/>aid. The alarming symptoms were such, that business <lb/>was nearly suspended–the white population seeking <lb/>safety in other islands, or in the remote and healthiest <lb/>part of this. I assure you, that every thing had a <lb/>most gloomy appearance ; and the disease was so con<lb break="no"/>tagious, one man would hardly venture to touch ano<lb break="no"/>ther. The William's crew, from their mutinous dis<lb break="no"/>position, deserted her–some have since died ; and <lb/>some remain sick. The weather has become good <lb/>within these fifteen days, and the health of the island <lb/>improving fast.'</p>
                <p>A series of Sierra Leone Gazettes, to the 20th of <lb/>February, have reached us. They contain no intelli<lb break="no"/>gence of particular interest, expect that the colony ap<lb break="no"/>pears to have been healthy at that period. In one of <lb/>them we find a contradiction of the reports which <lb/>found their way into the English papers some months <lb/>since of the dreadful mortality that prevailed in that <lb/>settlement. It states that the "total number of Euro<lb break="no"/>peans who died in the Peninsula in 1818, was eight <lb/>men, three women, and two children. We lost no ci<lb break="no"/>vil, military or colonial officer, excepting one young <lb/>Gentleman who died a month after his arrival, and is <lb/>included in the number."</p>
                <p>A letter from the Havannah, dated 27th February, <lb/>mentions that the article of coffee is gradually rising <lb/>in value, and that an agent from Messrs Baring is <lb/>making purchases there to the amount of 1/3 a million <lb/>sterling, in that single commodity.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Extract of a letter from William Hunt, esq."  <lb/>To H. Hunt, esq.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>"Washington Hotel, New Orleans, Dec. 25. 1818.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Brother</hi>  – We arrived safe in the mouth of <lb/>the Mississippi on the 10th of this month, after a voyage <lb/>of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in <lb/>excellent health, and very happy. There are 35 English <lb/>vessels from Liverpool now here, and a great many Eng<lb break="no"/>lish emigrants from Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Lanca<lb break="no"/>shire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Somersetshire ; and, <lb/>in fact, from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island <lb/>we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a <lb/>week in the river, about 80 miles below New Orleans ; <lb/>we all went on shore, and had plenty of rabbit shooting. <lb/>I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun, by Knock, <lb/>corner of Fetter-lane. Henry, myself, and Mr Blake <lb/>went one day into the woods to kill deer, by night co<lb break="no"/>ming on, we lost our road ; and, differing in opinions, we <lb/>separated, Henry and Mr Blake taking one road, and my<lb break="no"/>self the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten <lb/>o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods, <lb/>and did not return to us till the next morning. It being <lb/>wet, and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground, in spite <lb/>of the remonstrances of Mr Blake, caught a severe cold, <lb/>and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days, <lb/>but he is now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In <lb/>the river there are thousands of wild swans, wild geese, <lb/>wild ducks, woodcocks, snipes, and other wild fowl. If <lb/>you were there, you would kill a waggon load in a day, <lb/>as I know you have frequently killed a horse load in Eng<lb break="no"/>land ; but they are a thousand times more numerous here <lb/>than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms <lb/>with them, and very cheap. No game certificate required <lb/>here. Myself, Henry, Mr Blake, and the other passen<lb break="no"/>gers, visited a French farmer, about six miles below New <lb/>Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land, whereon <lb/>are sugar plantations, sugar-houses, &amp; c. ; he made <lb/>250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers <lb/>five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter, <lb/>as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French <lb/>settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are <lb/>the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. – <lb/>They are very lazy, bad managers, and appear to use <lb/>their negroes very cruel, and work them very hard. The <lb/>Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer, <lb/>as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the <lb/>deaths are frequently seventy in a week. The scenery <lb/>of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like <lb/>the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and <lb/>Staines, and many of the buildings are as handsome as <lb/>those of Bath. Here is one Church, which is a very <lb/>beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spa<lb break="no"/>nish shops are all open, and it is a market during the <lb/>whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening, <lb/>gambling &amp; c. We are at the Washington Hotel, the <lb/>best in the city ; it is expensive, although very good <lb/>living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each, including <lb/>claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm <lb/>weather as in England, and it is as warm here now as it <lb/>was in England in July, although not half so oppressive <lb/>and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the elec<lb break="no"/>tion : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel, most of <lb/>them English. We do not trouble ourselves about poli<lb break="no"/>tics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil, <lb/>and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday <lb/>we were charged 100 dollars each for passage, and four <lb/>dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three <lb/>and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four <lb/>quarters of the best peas, rye, grass seed, and some more <lb/>of Hill's Scots ploughs, to be left at Messrs Brown and <lb/>Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the Illinois. <lb/>Mr Trimmer, an Englishman, has purchased 20,000 acres <lb/>of land near Mr Birkbeck, and has taken twenty couple of <lb/>hounds with him, so that we shall have some hunting as <lb/>well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to <lb/>marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells <lb/>me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over <lb/>the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they <lb/>are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought <lb/>over some with me, but they may follow us ; as I under<lb break="no"/>stand the labourers, with the pay of a dollar a day, can <lb/>live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer <lb/>of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply, and others that I <lb/>have seen from Illinois, report that the farmer can <lb/>get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is <lb/>a good sure market, and a fair profit and only one penny <lb/>per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to <lb/>pay. Price of labour is very dear here ; we pay a dollar <lb/>for washing every dozen of shirts, cravats, pocket handker<lb break="no"/>chiefs, &amp; c. &amp; c. The price of a gallon of best rum is one <lb/>and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things <lb/>shipped from England, I have paid 92 dollars for. Al<lb break="no"/>though I should like England very well if it was not for <lb/>the taxes, yet, from what I have seen hitherto, I like <lb/>America ten times better</p>

            </p>
                <p>Important Extracts of a Letter from a very Intelligent and re<lb break="no"/>spectable Engineer in Louisville, dated January 20. 1819.</p>
                <p>"The best time for coming to America I <lb/>should judge to be in the summer, to land in <lb/>September, so as to be able to get here before <lb/>the weather was too cold. It is safe to <lb/>settle in the beginning of winter or spring, so as <lb/>to inure to the climate by degrees. The best <lb/>plan for coming is to take a part of the steerage <lb/>of a vessel, and find your own provisions; you <lb/>will save more in this way, over a cabin passage, <lb/>than would buy a decent farm here. The lands <lb/>in this neighbourhood raise a crop of wheat and <lb/>one of corn alternately, and improve ; dung is <lb/>never applied, and is said to be hurtful. It is <lb/>without question what the land here is as good as <lb/>can be, and when to this is added the heat of <lb/>the summer, one ought to be able to raise crops <lb/>as heavy as they will stand. You wonder at 10 <lb/>dollars being enough to clear an acre. It is not <lb/>cleared, all the trees under 12 inches are cut <lb/>down and burned on the ground, and the large <lb/>ones are killed by cutting round the bark. The <lb/>ground is then prepared for Indian corn by <lb/>scratching it with a hoe, or a kind of shuffle, <lb/>which, from the looseness and mellowness of the <lb/>soil, is easily done, and in this way sixty or <lb/>eighty bushels an acre are sometimes raised. – <lb/>the trees die in a few months, and in three or <lb/>four years fall down one by one, and the roots <lb/>will rot out in seven or eight years. It is a <lb/>great want of sense in any new settler not to <lb/>adopt the modes of this country, proven to be the <lb/>best adapted to the state of it by 200 years ex<lb break="no"/>perience. The Americans, of all other people I <lb/>know of, are the most ingenious in adapting the <lb/>means to the end. I do not know if they have <lb/>more sense than other nations, but they certain<lb break="no"/>ly make it go farther. Every tools answers the <lb/>purpose most effectually. This is evident in their <lb/>axes. An American will cut down three times <lb/>more trees and square three times more timber <lb/>than the best of your wrights could do, and not <lb/>by more strength but by fitter tools. So it is <lb/>with cutting their grain ; a man will cut down <lb/>four acres of wheat in a day, what what he calls <lb/>a cradle scythe, and lay it as refular for bind<lb break="no"/>ing as reapers can do. Sixty bushels of Indian <lb/>corn is the average of Kentucky ; but 25 bushels <lb/>of wheat is about the average of an acre. It is <lb/>easier farming here than with you on sundry ac<lb break="no"/>counts ; the soil is free, few weeds make their <lb/>appearance, and when ploughed down are cer<lb break="no"/>tainly killed by the hot sun. There are no frosts <lb/>to injure the crop, and no wet weather to de<lb break="no"/>stroy it when cut. Hay is made in two days, <lb/>and grain is cut one day and stacked or housed <lb/>the next. From the shortness and mildness of <lb/>the winter, little provender is needed for the <lb/>stock. Swine are raised at no expence. They <lb/>breed and feed in the woods, and only want from <lb/>one to three bushels of corn to fatten for killing, <lb/>when they sell for five cents a lb. In the less <lb/>settled parts of the country, it is the practise to <lb/>give all the corn to swine and then send them to <lb/>market. A bushel of corn is equal in nutriment <lb/>to a bushel of wheat for man or beast.</p>

               <pb/>The brig Henry sailed from Cork on Wednes<lb break="no"/>day se'ennight, with about two hundred passen<lb break="no"/>gers for Aux Cayes, to join Sir Gregor M'Gre<lb break="no"/>gor, who lately landed on the Spanish Main with <lb/>a small force. General M'Gregor, it seems, left <lb/>authority with Colonel Eyre to recruit men for <lb/>his service, and to ship them as he best could. – <lb/>There are a number of idle gentlemen about <lb/>Dublin at present, and also many in the country, <lb/>who have been captivated with the speculation of <lb/>embarking in the Patriotic cause, and for some <lb/>time they have appeared in the streets in fanci<lb break="no"/>ful uniforms. We understand that Col. Eyre has <lb/>formed a Committee, who treat with such young <lb/>gentlemen as have the inclination to proceed on <lb/>the enterprise, and have money to pay for such <lb/>rank as they may wish to possess under M'Gre<lb break="no"/>gor. The money thus furnished is made a stock <lb/>purse to pay the freight of the vessel, and hence <lb/>it is necessary that the greater part of the adven<lb break="no"/>turers should be <hi rend="italic">officers</hi>  ; for those who are con<lb break="no"/>tented with the humble station of privates are <lb/>not required to contribute and their passage, <lb/>subsistence, &amp;c. must be defrayed by the com<lb break="no"/>mon fund. Mr D'Evereaux, from the county <lb/>of Wexford, is also raising men for the same <lb/>service, but under different circumstances. He <lb/>professes to have authority from General Bo<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>livar to grant commissions, and to ship the men <lb/>he may raise for head-quarters in Venezuela. Mr <lb/>D'Evereaux has not yet dispatched any men, and <lb/>Col. Eyre has certainly shewn more activity in <lb/>this respect. – <hi rend="italic">Dublin Journal</hi>.</p>

                <p>Advices have been received again from the Cape of <lb/>Good Hope of 6th March, which are several days later <lb/>than those acquired formerly. Of the rising of the <lb/>Caffres there remains no doubt, although it does <lb/>not appear that Government have as yet received of<lb break="no"/>ficial information regarding it. The private accounts <lb/>state that two valuable officers had lost their lives, and <lb/>also a great number of men. The Governor himself <lb/>in order by his presence the sooner to suppress the Caf<lb break="no"/>fres, had, with a competent force, proceeded to the in<lb break="no"/>terior. Great inconvenience was experienced for the <lb/>want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not this <lb/>been the case, it was believed that in a very few days <lb/>tranquility would have been restored.</p>
                <p>We are sorry to state that another hurricane has ta<lb break="no"/>ken place in the Isle of France ; it commenced on the <lb/>25th January, and has done great mischief to the ship<lb break="no"/>ping, and also to the plantations of that ill-fated Is<lb break="no"/>land.</p>
                <p>A Dutch mail has arrived, with papers to the 19th <lb/>inst. At Batavia, two of the leaders of the late distur<lb break="no"/>bances have been tried and execute, and that degree <lb/>of tranquility which terror produces has been restored. <lb/>In the administration of their colonies in the east, the <lb/>conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and op<lb break="no"/>pressive ; and it is to be regretted that the extensive <lb/>and fertile island of Java should have been surrendered <lb/>to their rapacity. During the short time that it was in <lb/>possession of this country, various important improve<lb break="no"/>ments were introduced into its domestic administration ; <lb/>the practise of torture, according to the humane and <lb/>enlightened maxims of British jurisprudence, was abo<lb break="no"/>lished ; new and better modes of collecting the revenue <lb/>were adopted ; and a spirit of mildness and of regard <lb/>for the interests of all the various classes of which the <lb/>population is composed, was evinced, which made the <lb/>British Government highly popular.</p>
                <p>Considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants <lb/>for the safety of the Queen Charlotte, Jamaica packet. <lb/>She sailed from Jamaica the 29th March, and had a <lb/>great quantity of specie on board. No things have <lb/>since been received of her. Several vessels sailed since <lb/>her departure, and have arrived safe. The Ocean quit<lb break="no"/>ted Jamaica on the 6th of April, and arrived here se<lb break="no"/>veral days since.</p>
                <p>Several passengers landed at Portsmouth on Thurs<lb break="no"/>day from Jamaica, bring Port Royal Papers to the <lb/>25th of March. The 50th Regiment had arrived at <lb/>Kingston, from Cork ; and the 2nd West India Regi<lb break="no"/>ment was about to embark for Sierra Leone to be dis<lb break="no"/>banded.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration</hi>.</p>
                <p>The increased population of this country, as <lb/>well as the great difficult to which the mid<lb break="no"/>dling classes of society are exposed in their ef<lb break="no"/>forts to procure the ordinary means of suste<lb break="no"/>nance, has given rise to the formation of little <lb/>copartnerships, or joint stock companies of in<lb break="no"/>dividuals, who, being unable to command capi<lb break="no"/>tal enough singly, to encounter the expences of <lb/>a new settlement, have put their little funds to<lb break="no"/>gether, with a determination to sail for America, <lb/>and there jointly to labour for the general good <lb/>of the whole, until fortune shall so far favour <lb/>their efforts as to enable them to become inde<lb break="no"/>pendent of each other. By this means much less <lb/>than the hundred pounds stipulated by Mr Birk<lb break="no"/>beck as the proper stock for an emigrant to be<lb break="no"/>gin with, will be sufficient ; and thus a new im<lb break="no"/>petus will be given to that tide of huma beings <lb/>which is constantly flowing towards the new <lb/>world. Would it not be policy to give encou<lb break="no"/>ragement to these industrious swarms to settle in <lb/>our own colonies? We have heard with some <lb/>pleasure in rumour that several parishes have <lb/>taken into their serious consideration the pru<lb break="no"/>dence of establishing a fund for the encourage<lb break="no"/>ment of those poor persons who may be dispo<lb break="no"/>ed to seek a means of occupation in Canada ; <lb/>in furtherance of which laudable design, an ap<lb break="no"/>plication is to be made to Government for grants <lb/>of land in desirable siutations, especially in Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada, where the climate is described to be <lb/>of the finest description. There is no doubt that <lb/>many who are now pining in workhouses would <lb/>gladly accept of such an alternative, and who, <lb/>instead of being, as at present, a burthen to them<lb break="no"/>selves and to society, would, by their exertions, <lb/>be adding to the importance and stability of our <lb/>possessions in that quarter, as well as open<lb break="no"/>ing a new source for the consumption of our ma<lb break="no"/>nufactures.</p>

            </p>
                <p>"English Prairie, (Illinoia,) Nov.25. 1818.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>  – Your favour of 15th June is before me. <lb/>Presuming you retain a copy of the queries, I <lb/>proceed to answer then in order: – Respecting <lb/>domestic servants ; what may be the condition of <lb/>our colony in two years it is impossible to foresee, <lb/>but should it be in your power to bring with you <lb/>female domestics, it would be well to do so ; also <lb/>a carpenter or two and a few labourers ; if with <lb/>families, so much the better. Written engage<lb break="no"/>ments for a term, or indentures, are not binding, <lb/>unless renewed on this side of the Atlantic. I <lb/>have not seen any of these documents, and can <lb/>therefore give you no precise directions for them : <lb/>perhaps a simple engagement from the parties, <lb/>acknowledging as a debt the expence incurred <lb/>in bringing our, might be a sufficient security, <lb/>leaving their wages to be determined here ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the current rates, yet to be establish<lb break="no"/>ed by the proportion of supply to the demand, <lb/>which, as I remarked above, it is now impossible <lb/>to ascertain. As to the number of labourers, or <lb/>female domestics, you would need perhaps six of <lb/>the former and two of the latter would a safe <lb/>adventure, looking to the colony for an ad<lb break="no"/>dition, should you need it, after you are set<lb break="no"/>tled – before that you will find a greater num<lb break="no"/>ber an incumbrance : this is, I think, all I <lb/>can say to your first, third, fourth, and fifth <lb/>queries. All expence of transfer of your fami<lb break="no"/>ly and luggage, supposing the latter to weigh <lb/>ten thousand pounds, I should estimate under <lb/>L.1000 sterling. On this particular subject Mr R. Flower <lb/>would give you most particular information – <lb/>The luggage would cost about ten dollars per <lb/>100 lbs. So much for your query. To the se<lb break="no"/>venth query – I think L.200 would assist your <lb/>family in plenty for a year, exclusive of wages <lb/>and clothing. Eighth query – L.3000 would be <lb/>a good capital for a section, or 640 acres, and I <lb/>question your wishing to hold in cultivation a <lb/>larger tract. Ninth query – I consider our si<lb break="no"/>tuation not liable to future disturbance from In<lb break="no"/>dians, in the event of a war between Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain and the United States, being covered by in<lb break="no"/>creasing settlements to the west, north-west, and <lb/>north. Tenth query – The earthquakes men<lb break="no"/>tioned by Bradbury I have heard of from many <lb/>persons ; but I have not discovered that it has <lb/>left any impression on the public mind ; on this <lb/>score, for my own part, I feel no anxiety about <lb/>the matter ; Great Britain, I suppose, in propor<lb break="no"/>tion to its dimensions, is equally liable to earth<lb break="no"/>quakes. Elenventh query, – The route by New Or<lb break="no"/>leans will, I have no doubt, be preferable to that <lb/>by the eastern cities. When due precaution <lb/>against the diseases of the climate are observed, <lb/>I have never failed to recommend it. Twelfth <lb/>query – The health of my family has not suffered <lb/>from the climate. One of my sons has been <lb/>affected with ague. This summer has been <lb/>more sickly in these parts than any season for <lb/>seven years past, and has afforded me a most en<lb break="no"/>couraging confirmation of the temperature and <lb/>salubrity of our settlement, and has also afforded <lb/>immeasurable proofs of those facts regarding the <lb/>sufferings of new settlers, to which I have so <lb/>anxiously invited the attention of the readers of <lb/>my journal. On the whole, provided common <lb/>sense should be seconded by common industry, <lb/>in the inclosure and cultivation of our colony, I <lb/>think we shall not be visisted by more than our <lb/>due share of physical calamity. I deferred no<lb break="no"/>ticing your second query, the subject being con<lb break="no"/>nected with the proposal respecting land, at the <lb/>conclusion of your letter. I would strongly re<lb break="no"/>commend your deferring the purchase of land <lb/>until your arrival. It would be difficult to con<lb break="no"/>vey to you the reasons, but you would feel the <lb/>propriety of my advice, should you come. I <lb/>think you would have as good a choice two <lb/>years hence as now, because excellent siutations, <lb/>as yet unsurveyed, will then be on sale. I have <lb/>no eligible offer to make you beyond a section. <lb/>You inquire concerning venomous reptiles ; they <lb/>are no source of injury or alarm to us. Insects, <lb/>in new countries, often abound to an astonishing <lb/>degree, and are sufficiently teazing to man and <lb/>beast. Many species yield instantly to cultiva<lb break="no"/>tion, and are heard of no more as plagues ; <lb/>others will continue until conquered by order <lb/>and industry. The thermometer ranges from <lb/>13 below zero to 89 above ; the extremes are, of <lb/>course, of rare occurence, and short duration. <lb/>At Philadelphia, I understand, it rose this sum<lb break="no"/>mer 97, and in this neighbourhood, in the low <lb/>river bottoms, I believe it might reach that de<lb break="no"/>gree. On our praire I think it never reached <lb/>89. The smaller streams are rapid and soon <lb/>dry ; the larger sluggish in the extreme – cat<lb break="no"/>fish, perch, sturgeons abound, and many others <lb/>I believe. I think 1000 dollars would build a <lb/>comfortable plain dwelling. – Your obedient ser<lb break="no"/>vant, <hi rend="smallcaps">M. Birkbeck</hi>."</p>

            </p>
                <p>The following letters explains, in detail, the de<lb break="no"/>gree of co-operation which Government proposes <lb/>to afford to those persons who may wish to emi<lb break="no"/>grate from this country. It will be read with <lb/>peculiar interest, and it enables us to answer, in <lb/>the most satisfactory manner, the many inquiries <lb/>which have been addressed to us, upon the na<lb break="no"/>ture and extent of the plan of which the Chancel<lb break="no"/>lor of the Exchequer submitted an outline to <lb/>Parliament just before its prorogation.</p>
                <p>( <hi rend="smallcaps">Official Circular</hi>.</p>
                <p>"Downing Street, London, 1819. <lb/>I have to acquaint you in reply to your letter of the <lb/>–, that the following are the conditions under which <lb/>it is proposed to give encouragement to emigration to the <lb/>Cape of Good Hope.</p>
                <p>The sufferings to which many individuals have been ex<lb break="no"/>posed, who have emigrated to his Majesty's foreign pos<lb break="no"/>sessions, unconnected and unprovided with any capiral, or <lb/>even the means of support, having been very afflicting to <lb/>themselves, and equally burdensome to the colonies to <lb/>which they have proceeded, the Government have deter<lb break="no"/>mined to confine the application of the money recently <lb/>voted by address in the House of Commons, to those per<lb break="no"/>sons, who possessing the means, will engage to carry out, at <lb/>the least, ten able bodied individuals above 18 years of age, <lb/>with or without families, the Government always reserving <lb/>to itself the right of selecting from the several offers made <lb/>to them those which may prove, upon examination, to be <lb/>most eligible.</p>
                <p>In order to give some security to the Government, that <lb/>the persons undertaking to make these establishments <lb/>have the means of doing so, every person engaging to take <lb/>out the above mentioned number of persons or families <lb/>shall deposit at the rate of L.10 (to be repaid as herein<lb break="no"/>after mentioned) for every famly so taken out, provided <lb/>that the family does not consist of more than one man, <lb/>one woman, and two children under 14 years of age. All <lb/>children above the number of two will have to be paid for, <lb/>in addition to the deposit above mentioned, in the propor<lb break="no"/>tion of L.5 for every two children under 14 years of age <lb/>and L.5 for every person between the ages of 14 and 18.</p>
                <p>In consideration of this deposit, a passage shall be pro<lb break="no"/>vided at the expence of Government for the settlers, who <lb/>shall also be victualled from the time of their embarka<lb break="no"/>tion until the time of their landing in the colony.</p>
                <p>A grant of land, under the conditions hereafter speci<lb break="no"/>fied, be made to him at the rate of 100 acres for every <lb/>such person or family whom he shall so take out ; one-third <lb/>of the sum advanced to Government on the outset shall <lb/>be repaid on landing, when the victualling at the expence</p>
                <p>
               <pb/>of Government shall cease. A further proportion of one<lb break="no"/>third shall be repaid, as soon as it shall be certified to the <lb/>Governor of the colony that the settlers under the direc<lb break="no"/>tion of the person taking them out are actually located <lb/>upon the land assigned to them ; and the remainer at <lb/>the expiration of three months from the date of their lo<lb break="no"/>cation.</p>
                <p>If any parishes in which there may be a redundancy <lb/>of population shall unite in selecting an intelligent indivi<lb break="no"/>dual to proceed to the Cape, with settlers under his direc<lb break="no"/>tion, not less in number and of the description above<lb break="no"/>mentioned, and shall advance money in the proportion <lb/>above-mentioned, the Government will grant land to such <lb/>an individual at the rate of 100 acres for every head of a fa<lb break="no"/>mily, leaving the parish at liberty to make such conditions <lb/>with the individual, or the settlers, as may be calculated <lb/>to prevent the parish becoming again chargeable with the <lb/>maintenance of such settlers, in the event of their return <lb/>to this country.</p>
                <p>But no offers of this kind will be accepted, unless it <lb/>shall be clear that the persons proposing to become settlers <lb/>shall have distinctly given their consent, and the head of <lb/>each family is not infirm or incapable of work.</p>
                <p>It is further proposed, that in any case in which one <lb/>hundred families proceed together, and apply for leave to <lb/>carry out with them a minister of their own persuasion, <lb/>Government will, upon their being actually located, as<lb break="no"/>sign a salary to the minister who they have may have <lb/>selected to accompany them, if he shall be approved by <lb/>the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>The lands will be granted at a quit rent to be fixed, <lb/>which rent, however, will be remitted for the first ten <lb/>years ; and at the expiration of three years (during which <lb/>the party and a number of families, in the proportion of <lb/>one for every 100 acres, must have resided on the estate), <lb/>the land shall be measured at the expence of Government, <lb/>and the holder shall obtain, without fee, his title thereto, <lb/>on a perpetual quit rent, not exceeding in any case L. 2 <lb/>sterling for every 100 acres ; subject, however to this <lb/>clause beyond the usual reservations"–that the land shall <lb/>become forefited to Government, in case the party shall <lb/>abandon the estate, or not bring it into cultivation within <lb/>a given number of years. I am <lb/>Your most obedient humble servant. <lb/>* The usual reservations are the right of the Crown to mines <lb/>of precious stones, of gold and silver, and to make such roads <lb/>as may be necessary for the convenience of the colony.</p>

               <pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p>A letter from Corfu, dated the 10th ult. states that <lb/>the Governor of the Ionian Islands, General Mait<lb break="no"/>land, embarked on the 8th inst. for Rome, in order to <lb/>negotitate a Concordat relative to the Romish Clergy <lb/>of the United Islands, as it appeared that Lord Guild<lb break="no"/>ford, who had been charged with the affair by the <lb/>Prince Regent, had failed in his negotiation to that <lb/>effect.</p>
                <p>Previously to the departure of the Governor, a de<lb break="no"/>putation from the Parguinotes emigrants waited upon <lb/>him, to claim the sum to be paid by Ali Pacha, for <lb/>property left in Parga, agreeably to stipulation. Ge<lb break="no"/>neral Maitland assured them he would not depart with<lb break="no"/>out adopting measures in their favour, and immediate<lb break="no"/>ly issued a proclamation, appointing a commission of <lb/>payment. Sir Frederick Adam fills the office of High <lb/>Commissioner, <hi rend="italic">ad interim</hi>, during the absence of the <lb/>Governor.</p>
                <p>Advices from Demerara are received to the 3d ult. <lb/>The following is from the Guiana Chronicle of the <lb/>24th May:–" We observe by St Vincent: papers, <lb/>which we have just received, that the Royal York Ran<lb break="no"/>gers, under the command of Colonel Smelt, had em<lb break="no"/>barked on board the Diadem and Elizabeth transports <lb/>for Canada, where the regiment is intended to be dis<lb break="no"/>banded. It is stated that each of the men will have a <lb/>certain portion of land allotted them in that province <lb/>for cultivation and their future support.</p>
                <p>We have received Newfoundland Papers to the 23d <lb/>ult by which we learn that in the Court of Session, on <lb/>the 18th idem, Capt. Redman, of the brig San Do<lb break="no"/>mingo, from Ross, was ordered to pay a fine of 10l. <lb/>each, for 20 passengers brought in that vessel over and <lb/>above the number allowed by act of Parliament; and a <lb/>further sum of 10l. for not having the regulations re<lb break="no"/>specting passengers posted up in some conspicuous part <lb/>of the vessel ; making in all a fine of 210l.</p>
                <p>We subjoin an extract from the Montreal Herald of <lb/>the 12th June, relative to Mr Gourlay, the celebrated <lb/>reformer:</p>
                <p>From the Niagara Spectator, of the 27th May, <lb/>we find the far famed champion of civil liberty, Mr <lb/>Gourlay, has again made his debut in an address to <lb/>the resident landowners of Upper Canada. This pro<lb break="no"/>duction is of the same stamp as him other lucubrations, <lb/>abounding with strong and vigorous assertions in place <lb/>of facts–a well wove sophistry to beguile the super<lb break="no"/>ficial reader ; and some of the most egregious errors in <lb/>colonial policy recommended with a speciousness well <lb/>calculated to deceive. Having so often stated out dis<lb break="no"/>sent from the political proceeding of this reformer, it <lb/>would be deemed intrusive by many of our readers to <lb/>enter into a refutation of the tenets, or an exposure of <lb/>the absurdities, contained in his address. By others <lb/>we might be supposed as exalting over a prostrate foe. <lb/>Both imputations we utterly disclaim ; while, as men <lb/>we regret that the mad career pursued by Mr Gourlay has <lb/>deprived society of the benefits which might have been <lb/>reaped from his better talents (of which he doubtless <lb/>has a share), we must, as good subjects, feel happy <lb/>that his career has been checked without any bad con<lb break="no"/>sequences to society.</p>
                <p>The following is the present distribution of the for<lb break="no"/>ces in the West Indies:– <lb/>2d Regiment (or Queen's) –Demerara. <lb/>4th Ditto–Head-quarters, Grenada, five companies; <lb/>Trinidad, three companies ; and Tobago, two com<lb break="no"/>panies. <lb/>5th Ditto–Head-quarters, Antigua, five companies ; <lb/>St. Christopher's, four companies ; Montserrat, one <lb/>company. <lb/>9th Ditto–Head-quarters, St Vincent's, five compa<lb break="no"/>nies ; Dominica, three companies ; St Lucia, two com<lb break="no"/>panies. <lb/>21st Ditto (Fusileers)–Barbadoes. <lb/>1st West India Regiment–Head-quarters, Barba<lb break="no"/>does, six companies ; St Lucia, one company ; Domi<lb break="no"/>nica, two companies ; Antigua, one company. <lb/>3rd Ditto–Head-quarters, Trinidad, five companies <lb/>till further orders. <lb/>In Jamaica are the 50th, 58th, 61st, and 92d regi<lb break="no"/>ment. <lb/>In Honduras, five companies of the 2d West India <lb/>regiment.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Intended Colony at the Cape of  <lb/>Good Hope.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>The following letter explains, in detail, the degree <lb/>of co-operation which Government proposes to afford to <lb/>those persons who may wish to emigrate from this <lb/>country.</p>
                <p>( <hi rend="smallcaps">Official Circular</hi>.)</p>
                <p>"Downing-street. London, 1819. <lb/>"The sufferings to which many individuals have <lb/>been exposed, who have emigrated to his Majesty's <lb/>foreign possessions, unconnected, and unprovided with <lb/>any capital, or even the means of support, having been <lb/>very afflicting to themselves, and equally burdensome <lb/>to the colonies to which they have proceeded, the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment have determined to confine the application <lb/>of the money recently voted by Address in the House <lb/>of Commons, to those persons who, possessing the <lb/>means, will engage to carry out, at the least, ten able<lb break="no"/>bodied individuals above 18 years of age, with or with<lb break="no"/>out families, the Government always reserving to it<lb break="no"/>self the right of selecting, from the several offers made <lb/>to them, those which may prove, upon examination, to <lb/>be most eligible.</p>
                <p>"In order to give some security to the Government, <lb/>that the persons undertaking to make these establish<lb break="no"/>ments have the means of doing so, every person engag<lb break="no"/>ing to take out the above-mentioned number of per<lb break="no"/>sons or families, shall deposit, at the rate of 10l. (to be <lb/>repaid as hereinafter mentioned) for every family so <lb/>taken out, provided that the family does not consist of <lb/>more than one man, one woman, and two children un<lb break="no"/>der 14 years of age. All children ahove the number <lb/>of two must be paid for, in addition to the deposit <lb/>above-mentioned, in the proportion of 5l. for every per<lb break="no"/>son between the ages of 14 and 18.</p>
                <p>"In consideration of this deposit, a passage shall be <lb/>provided at the expence of Government for the settlers, <lb/>who shall be victualled from the time of their em<lb break="no"/>barkation until the time of their landing in the Colony.</p>
                <p>"A grant of land, under the conditions hereafter spe<lb break="no"/>cified, shall be made to him, at the rate of 100 acres <lb/>for every such person or family whom he so takes out ; <lb/>one-third of the sum advanced to Government on the <lb/>outset, shall be repaid on landing, when the victuall<lb break="no"/>ing at the expense of the Government shall cease. A fur<lb break="no"/>ther proportion of one-third shall be repaid, as soon as <lb/>it shall be certified to the Governor of the Colony that <lb/>the settlers, under the direction of the person taking <lb/>them out, are actually located upon the lands assigned to <lb/>them ; and the remainder at the expiration of three <lb/>months from the date of their location.</p>
                <p>"If any parishes in which there may be a redun<lb break="no"/>dancy of population, shall unite in selecting an intelli<lb break="no"/>gent individual to proceed to the Cape, with settlers <lb/>under his direction, not less in number and of the des<lb break="no"/>cription above-mentioned, and shall advance money in <lb/>the proportion above-mentioned, the Government will <lb/>grant land to such an individual at the rate of 100 <lb/>acres for every head of a family, leaving the parish at <lb/>liberty to make such conditions with the individual, <lb/>or the settlers, as may be calculated to prevent the pa<lb break="no"/>rish becoming again chargeable with the maintenance <lb/>of such settlers, in the event of their return to this <lb/>country.</p>
                <p>"But no offers of this kind will be accepted, unless <lb/>it shall be clear that the persons proposing to become <lb/>settlers shall have distinctly given their consent, and <lb/>that the head of each family is not infirm or incapable of <lb/>work.</p>
                <p>"It is further proposed, that in any case in which <lb/>one hundred families proceed together, and apply for <lb/>leave to carry out with them a minister of their own <lb/>persuasion, Government will, upon their being actually <lb/>located, assign a salary to the minister whom they may <lb/>have selected to accompany them, if he shall be ap<lb break="no"/>proved by the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>"The lands will be granted at a quit rent, to be fix<lb break="no"/>ed, which rent, however, will be remitted for the first <lb/>10 years ; and at the expiration of three years (during <lb/>which the party, and a number of families, in the pro<lb break="no"/>portion of 1 for every 100 acres, must have resided on <lb/>the estate) the land shall be measured at the expense <lb/>of Government and the holder shall obtain, without <lb/>fee, his title thereto, on a perpetual quit rent, not ex<lb break="no"/>ceeding[?] in any case of 2l. sterling for every 100 acres <lb/>subject, however to this clause[?] beyond the usual re<lb break="no"/>servations*–that the land shall become forfeited to <lb/>Government, in case the party shall abandone the es<lb break="no"/>tate, or not bring it into the cultivator within a given <lb/>number of years. I am, <lb/>"Your most obedient servant."</p>
                <p>* The usual reservations are the right of the Crown <lb/>to mines of precious stones, of gold and silver, and to <lb/>make such roads as may be necessary for the conveni<lb break="no"/>ence of the Colony.</p>
                <p>There are already three extensive settlements on the <lb/>South East Coast of Africa, where the finest wheat is <lb/>produced, with little labour, namely Algoa Bay, St. <lb/>Catherine's Bay, and the new settlement on the Kny<lb break="no"/>sua, a considerable river, which is navigable for large <lb/>vessels to the Northward. There are also extensive <lb/>and fertile lands towards Saldanha Bay. As the pro<lb break="no"/>duce from the new colonists will consist of grain and <lb/>as the markets of the Cape of Good Hope, the Isle of <lb/>France, Brazils &amp;c. will in all probability be soon <lb/>overstocked, the settlers will look to the mother coun<lb break="no"/>try for a market, when an unfavourable harvest renders <lb/>the import necessary ; and in anticipation of this event, <lb/>the merchants interested in the Cape trade intend, we <lb/>understand, to make an application to Government <lb/>respecting the Corn Laws, to put the corn from the <lb/>Cape of Good Hope on the same footing as grain from <lb/>the British North American colonies.</p>

                <p>The accounts received on Tuesday from the Cape of <lb/>Good Hope are to the 17th April, which are consi<lb break="no"/>derably later than those previously received.</p>
                <p>Information has just reached Cape Town, that a <lb/>detachment of troops, joined by a number of the inha<lb break="no"/>bitants, who had been sent to suppress the Caffres, had <lb/>succeeded in driving them back, and were compelled to <lb/>cross the river. The corn districts were in a great <lb/>measure cleared of the savages, and the country-people <lb/>were returning to their homes, where they considered <lb/>themselves secure from any further attacks, at least for <lb/>some time to come.</p>
                <p>Letters have just been received, via Calcutta, from <lb/>New South Walves, up to the end of November. The <lb/>colony was then all well, and several convict-ships (the <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">Marley, Glory, Mario, Isabella,</hi>  and others) had ar<lb break="no"/>rived, having made the passage out direct in the short <lb/>period of three months and twenty days, and landed <lb/>all their convicts and passengers in good health. This <lb/>may be considered as another, among many proofs, that <lb/>it is unnecessary to make any stay at any intermediate <lb/>port.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Extract of a letter from Sierra Leone, dated </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">January 9</hi>
            </p>
                <p>"It is with the deepest regret I inform you, that <lb/>notwithstanding the liberality of Great Britain, and the <lb/>faith of treaties solemnly entered into, this coast swarms <lb/>with slave vessels, drugging thousands of its miserable <lb/>inhabitants into endless captivity. A few days ago <lb/>arrived here the Union, of Liverpool : the supercargo <lb/>states, that during his stay in the River Calaba, not less <lb/>than eight vessels, averaging 500 slaves each, had sail<lb break="no"/>ed for the Spanish Collective."</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">" Montreal, May 11</hi>
            </p>
                <p>"We learn there are about 70 souls, mostly Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, preparing to set out from this place, the 25th <lb/>inst. for Lord Selkirk's settlement on the River Rouge. <lb/>The number of settlers there at this time, it is said <lb/>amount to about 590. An intelligent Canadian, in <lb/>easy circumstances with whom we conversed, and who <lb/>goes thither with the before-mentioned settlers, with <lb/>all his family, says he passed a winter there when en<lb break="no"/>gaged in this for trade and reports it to be a fertile <lb/>country, and the climate much milder than that of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada. Thus, there is every appearance, that this Co<lb break="no"/>lony, in the course of time, will become populous and <lb/>flourishing."</p>

            </p>
                <p>We are sorry to state that another most distressing <lb/>and calamitous fire has taken place at St. John's New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Captain Critchelly, of the alliance, arriv-[?] <lb/>ed at Liverpool from Carbonear, in Newfoundland, [?] <lb/>which he left on the 22d ult. states that a fire broke <lb/>out in an uninhabited house in St. John's between one <lb/>and two o'clock in the morning of the 18th of June <lb/>and that from the inflammable nature of the house[?] <lb/>and more particularly of their roofs, it spread with such <lb/>rapidity, that in the short space of three hours 170 fa-[?] <lb/>milies were burnt out, besides an immense quantity <lb/>of produce consumed in various stores and ware<lb break="no"/>houses.</p>
                <p>We learn from another account, that the fire destroy<lb break="no"/>ed the whole of the old part of the town. It broke out <lb/>near Conder and Tracy's store, and burnt all between <lb/>that and Messrs Baine, Johnson and Co.'s.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Cape of Good Hope</hi>
            </p>
                <p>At the present moment, under the prospect of emi<lb break="no"/>gration, all intelligence coming from this quarter is of <lb/>peculiar interest. The letters which reached town [?] <lb/>Tuesday, mention that the Caffres had commenced [?] <lb/>tilities anew, and that their numbers were very consi<lb break="no"/>derable.</p>
                <p>Cape Town, May 5. <lb/>The Caffres have broken out, and a very serious war <lb/>is carried on at present on the borders. It is said <lb/>that the savages are to the amount of 50,000, and a de<lb break="no"/>tachment of 6000 attacked Graham's Town on Satur<lb break="no"/>day week, about 12 o'clock in the day, but were re<lb break="no"/>pulsed, and 150 left dead on the fiel. They carried <lb/>off 500 wounded. Orders have been issued in every <lb/>district of the colony for the young boors to inrol them<lb break="no"/>selves to oppose the enemy.</p>
                <p>Cape Town, May 16. <lb/>The 13th regiment, commanded by Colonel Wil<lb break="no"/>shire have come up with the main body of Caf<lb break="no"/>fres, near Graham's Town and have defeated them with <lb/>great loss. Since then they have withdrawn from the <lb/>British territory. The 54th regiment arrived at [?] <lb/>place a few days ago from England and have since[?] <lb/>marched off for the frontiers. A large number of in<lb break="no"/>fantry have been mounted on horseback to [?] <lb/>them to pursue more effectually the savages. They are <lb/>all in excellent spirits. It is reported that our present <lb/>Governor is going home, and that another has been ap<lb break="no"/>pointed.</p>
                <p>Jamaica Papers to the 10th ultimo has reached us, <lb/>which confirms the sad accounts of the miserable fate of <lb/>the followers of the fugitive M'Gregor. It appears <lb/>that the schooner Marsha[?] had brought accounts from <lb/>San Blas[?], that M'Gregor, after his disgraceful flight <lb/>from Porto Bello, proceeded[?] in the brig Hero, for St. <lb/>Andreas, where he arrived on the 7th of May, and left <lb/>on the 12th, having suffered considerably from the ef<lb break="no"/>fects of his leap. He promulgated a story that he had <lb/>been betrayed by some of his Officers, who had [?] <lb/>Porto Bello ; but added he would soon receive rein<lb break="no"/>forcements from England, when he would retake it.</p>
                <p>The Blossom arrived on Sunday from the South A<lb break="no"/>merican station, last from Rio Janeiro, whence she <lb/>sailed on the 8th of June. She landed about two mil<lb break="no"/>lions of dollars at Rio Janeiro, from Litna[?] and brought <lb/>to England about 140,000 on merchants' account. She, <lb/>and the Andromache, Captain Shirreff, having [?] <lb/>treasure on board, passed Lord Cochrane's squadron, <lb/>in the South Seas, but his Lordship did not discover <lb/>even the slightest intention of interrupting either of the <lb/>ships. His Lordship's squadron appeared in excellent <lb/>order ; and it is but justice to his Lordship to state, <lb/>that he has not resorted to any undue or improper <lb/>means to man his ships ; but on the contrary in every <lb/>instance of complaint made to him by the mas<lb break="no"/>ters of merchant shipping, of any of their crew having <lb/>deserted to him, he ordered the men to be again in<lb break="no"/>stantly sent on board their respective ships.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to the Cape of Good  <lb/>Hope.  <lb/>(From Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.)</hi>
            </p>
                <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has submitted to <lb/>Parliament the expediency of voting t50,000 towards <lb/>the encouragement of emigration to the Cape of Good <lb/>Hope. Let it be remembered, once for all, that it is <lb/>not because that colony is too thin of inhabitants, but <lb/>that the mother country is too full, that this plan is sug<lb break="no"/>gested. The question is not how you maintain <lb/>a surplus peasantry in the land that gave them birth, <lb/>but, whether you will stop emigration to the frozen <lb/>shores of Canada, and to the United States, or divert <lb/>and encourage it to the finest colony in the world – <lb/>We surely have learnt enough of North America to <lb/>convince us of the degraded and miserable conditions of <lb/>its people. South African, on the other hand, has every <lb/>advantage to repay the sacrifice of quitting the land of <lb/>our forefathers.</p>
                <p>The more fully to understand and appreciate these <lb/>advantages, we shall set before our readers a short view <lb/>of the conditions and facilities of the colony in ques<lb break="no"/>tion.</p>
                <p>The spring, from September to December, is the <lb/>most agreedable season. The summer, from December <lb/>to March, is often intensely hot. The autumn, from <lb/>March to June, is generally fine and pleasant. The <lb/>winter is rainy and stormy, and for the most part so <lb/>cold as to make fires very comfortable during the <lb/>months of July, August, and September. Most of the <lb/>diseases that appear among the natives proceed rather <lb/>from their gross and indolent modes of living, than the <lb/>unheathliness of the climate. The scarcity of water in <lb/>summer is unfavourable to cultivation ; and for want <lb/>of industry or materials this defect is not remedied, as <lb/>it is in India, by artificial tanks or reservoirs. When<lb break="no"/>ever, however, irrigation can be employed, either from <lb/>wells or rivers, the most abundant vegetation ensues. <lb/>Good and abundant water has always been found by <lb/>digging wells in Cape Town and the vicinity. In the <lb/>whole colony there is scarcely a river that can be called <lb/>navigable. Though swollen into torrents during the <lb/>winter, most of them dry up during the summer. All <lb/>the rivers are well stocked with perch, eels and small <lb/>turtle ; and with a certain distance from the coast <lb/>they abound with the several fish peculiar to these seas.</p>
                <p>There is general want of wood in South Africa – <lb/>At the distance, however, of 1.5 miles from Algoa bay <lb/>there is a large forest of a many thousand acres. Some <lb/>of these trees (taxus elongatus) grow to the amazing <lb/>size of 10 feet in diameter, and to the height of 30 or <lb/>40 feet of trunk clear of branches. The wood is use<lb break="no"/>ful for many purposes, but will not bear exposure to <lb/>weather. The iron-wood grows to the size of 3 feet <lb/>in diameter and the trunk straight and very high – <lb/>The Hassayni wood is a beautiful tree...</p>
                <p>The Constantia wine is known throughout Europe, <lb/>and to what perfection the other wines of the colony <lb/>are capable of being brought, may very fairly be au<lb break="no"/>gured for the great improvement that has already ta<lb break="no"/>ken place in its manufacture. Heretofore, the Dutch <lb/>farmer and the merchant have regarded more the quan<lb break="no"/>tity than the quality of their wine. And when a car<lb break="no"/>go was once shipped, it mattered little to them, whe<lb break="no"/>ther sound or sour it reached its destination. Little <lb/>care was taken in the growth of the vine ; the branches <lb/>were permitted to rest upon the groun ; while decay<lb break="no"/>ed and unripe grapes, stalks and leaves, were all pro<lb break="no"/>miscuously thrown in the wine-press. The mode <lb/>also of seasoning the casks with brimstone, and the <lb/>want of good brandy to fit it for foreign markets, have <lb/>all contributed to deteriorate the character and confine <lb/>the sale of Cape Madeira. These defects have lately <lb/>been in a great measure remedied. Proper persons <lb/>have been sent out from Madeira and this country, and <lb/>every care seems now taken to meet and secure the <lb/>growing demand in European markets. The trifling <lb/>duty affixed to Cape Madeira in this country, has been <lb/>the means of introducing it into many families, which <lb/>have hitherto used home-made wines. And though the <lb/>merchants at Madeira have made many remonstrances <lb/>on this preference, it surely is but equitable that en<lb break="no"/>couragement should be given to the stape export of a <lb/>colony, now decidely, and we must trust unalterably, Eng<lb break="no"/>lish. But in addition to wines there are other articles <lb/>of colonial growth, exported to the East Indies, Eu<lb break="no"/>rope, and America. Grain, wool, bides, and skins, <cb/>whale oil and bone, dried fruits, salt provisions, soap <lb/>and candles, aloes, tobacco. Such are the articles of <lb/>commerce that might be turned to the best account. – <lb/>But neither trade nor prosperit of any kind will con<lb break="no"/>tinue to thrive in this colony, under the present mode <lb/>of administering its government and laws. It has been <lb/>said, that despotism would be the best of governments <lb/>were the despot virtuous. This may be ; but conti<lb break="no"/>tuted as human nature is, we fear that the purest a<lb break="no"/>mongst us needs some control. Control, however, <lb/>there is none over the governor at the Cape. He makes <lb/>and annuls laws at pleasure. He inserts a proclama<lb break="no"/>tion in the Cape Gazette, and from that moment <hi rend="italic">his </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">fiat</hi>  becomes the law of the land. He has indeed an <lb/>adviser in the colonial secretary, whose influence does <lb/>not extend beyond that of mere advice. Strange to <lb/>add, the laws at the Cape are at this moment Dutch <lb/>laws, rescinded and obscured by all the edicts of the <lb/>different governors of the colony. All pleadings are <lb/>in writing, and were, till laterly, carried on, <hi rend="italic">foribus </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">clausis</hi>. In 1797 a court of appeal for criminal and <lb/>civil cases was established, over both of which the go<lb break="no"/>vernor presides. In India, in the West Indies, and in <lb/>Canada, there is a governor and a council. These act <lb/>as checks upon each other. But at the Cape there is <lb/>no appeal beyond the governor.</p>
                <p>The taxes, however, at the Cape, under which we <lb/>groan so painfully in this country, are comparatively <lb/>trifling. European luxuries very justly pay a heavy <lb/>import duty, but their purchase is matter of choice.– <lb/>This falls not upon the poor, not consequently will it <lb/>fall upon those most likely to emigrate under the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the Parliamentary grant.</p>
                <p>Noting indeed can be framed with greater care and <lb/>precautions, than the encouragement bedd out in Mr <lb/>Vansittuart's proposal. A small deposit, L. 10. is to be <lb/>made at the colonial office in Downing Street, by each <lb/>individual. A free passage is to be granted, and on <lb/>reaching the Cape, this deposit is to be returned to the <lb/>settler by the local government. And such is the li<lb break="no"/>berality that has guided the proposed plans, it is more<lb break="no"/>over stipulated, that if 100 families should agree to <lb/>emigrate, and their minister with them, not only <lb/>permission will be granted them so to do, but provi<lb break="no"/>sion will be made for him. The separation from coun<lb break="no"/>try and from kindred is thus softened, and it will allay <lb/>many a sorrowing regret and painful recollection that <lb/>in distant lands, and amongst a strange people, the <lb/>settler may still listen to the voice and instruction of a <lb/>pastor, to whom custom, veneration, and affection, have <lb/>all united to attach him.</p>
                <p>It appears that the experiment of a settlement of Eng<lb break="no"/>lish, has already been made upon a limited plan at <lb/>Saldanha Bay (the finest harbour in South Africa) : <lb/>and with such success as to give the best encourage<lb break="no"/>ment to a more extensive emigration. Indeed, from <lb/>what we have outselves seen of the colony and its great <lb/>facilities, we have no doubt whatever of the benefits <lb/>that must arise to the sober, steady exertions of the in<lb break="no"/>dustrious. At the Cape, or elsewhere, poverty and <lb/>misery will attend the vicious and indolent, but <lb/>certain we are, that there is no country under heaven, <lb/>where the poor may find a safer asylum, and where ac<lb break="no"/>tivity, economy and good conduct, will meet with so <lb/>certain and full a reward.</p>
                <p>During the stay of the 93rd regiment of foot (a <lb/>Scotch regiment) at the Cape, many of the privates <lb/>were known to save the whole of their pay, and were <lb/>thus enabled to return to England with a very hand <lb/>some little fortune. English servants of all descrip<lb break="no"/>tions are in great request, and 1.5 sterling a month are <lb/>no uncommon wages for a tolerable cook. It is never<lb break="no"/>theless to beremember, that clothes of all kinds are <lb/>expensive at the Cape, as no manufactory is permitted, <lb/>lest it should injure the trade of this country. Still <lb/>farmers in the country dress very coarsely and cheaply ; <lb/>and their wives and daughters, except on Sunday, are <lb/>humbly clad as themselves. Indeed, in so soft a <lb/>climate as the Cape, there is that occasion for mul<lb break="no"/>tiplicity and warmth of apparel which colder regions <lb/>require. For three-fourths of the year, the best bed is <lb/>a hard mattress with a single coverlet.</p>
                <p>There is point which we cannot pass over ; as <lb/>we think it very intimately connected with the virtue <lb/>and happiness of the settlers. And that is, the educa<lb break="no"/>tion of their children. Nothing is more neglected than <lb/>this in Southern Africa. The boors, (farmers) are <lb/>ignorant to a degree passing credence. With the mi<lb break="no"/>nister that is to accompany 100 families, it would be <lb/>highly expedient to send a few sober intelligent men as <lb/>schoolmasters. Attempts have been lately made to in<lb break="no"/>troduce into the colony the Madras system of instruc<lb break="no"/>tion, and a free school upon that plan has been esta<lb break="no"/>blished at Cape Town, with considerable success. Still <lb/>the natives are stubbornly averse to instruction. Their <lb/>luxurious and bountiful climate supplies them with all <lb/>the necessaries of human life, and beyond this they <lb/>have neither wish nor ambition. But if knowledge has <lb/>its fruits, ignorance has its weeds. The savage and <lb/>unparalleled cruelties that have heretofore been ex<lb break="no"/>ercised towards their slaves and the Hottentot servants <lb/>by these Dutch boors may very fairly be traced to want <lb/>of education, as a main cause. The unjust limits <lb/>shown by the Dutch laws to the <hi rend="italic">white</hi>  man's barbari<lb break="no"/>ties have doubtless encouraged their perpetration – <lb/>Cruelty is not the character of Englishmen, and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, too much care cannot be taken to guard the fa<lb break="no"/>milies of the new settlers against the contagion of the <lb/>inhumanities that they must see practised around them, <lb/>and how far an early and thorough acquaintance with <lb/>our duty to God and man will counteract this influence <lb/>aided a knowledge of common school attainments, <lb/>we need not say. The</p>
                <p>We have thrown these remarks together more as <lb/>loose hints for the consideration of our readers, than <lb/>with any idea of furnishing a complete view of so wide <lb/>and important a subject. We may be induced here<lb break="no"/>after to review the question more in detail. The plan <lb/>itself, as confessed by the Chanceller of the Exchequer, <lb/>has at present assumed a very imperfect shape. Ame<lb break="no"/>rice we have not seen, and can only speak from the <lb/>reports of other. Those reports are sufficiently dis<lb break="no"/>couraging. On the contrary, all who have seen and <lb/>described the Cape, have united in praising it. Food <lb/>is cheap and abundant, the price of labour is exceed<lb break="no"/>ingly high, trade is important and increasing, many <lb/>parts of the colony are beautiful, and its climate is <lb/>mild and healthy. There are few countries upon earth <lb/>where so many components of happiness will be found <lb/>to concentrate.</p>

                <p>Letters and papers have been received from Jamaica <lb/>to the 5 ult. We are sorry to observe, that the let<lb break="no"/>lets from thence state that the island was very unheal<lb break="no"/>thy. The deaths from the fever were[?] very[?] considerable, <lb/>and were increasing. The garrison had been particu<lb break="no"/>larly unhealthy.</p>
                <p>The [?]th and 92d regiments have suffered severely <lb/>by the [?] of the climate and are reduced to <lb/>mere skeletons. We [?] [?] the [?] of several <lb/>officers [?] [?] [?] to it ; causing them [?] <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>several others.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">(From the Port Royal Gazette of the 28th August) </hi>
               <lb/>"Private letters from Panama state, that Lord Co<lb break="no"/>chran had taken Petit Callao[?], in which port a vessel <lb/>was at anchor, having on board 100,000 dollars. It was <lb/>further said that his Lordship has passed Guayaquil <lb/>oh his way to Chili. Almost a forthnight ago, intelli<lb break="no"/>gence reached the Governor of Carthagena, from Santa <lb/>Fe, that General Bolivar, who had been joined by one <lb/>of Murillo's Generals, with a number of troops, was <lb/>making rapid advances towards Santa Fe with upwards <lb/>of 5000 men ; and it was expected the next courier <lb/>would announce[?] the fall of that place. An Aide-de<lb break="no"/>Camp of the Governor of that place arrived at Car<lb break="no"/>thagena at midnight with the above information. A<lb break="no"/>nother account states, that the Venezuelian army, un<lb break="no"/>der General Bolivar in person, had obtained posses<lb break="no"/>sion of Santa Fe, and that his advanced guard was at <lb/>Honda[?] ; he had succeeded in cutting off the retreat of <lb/>General Samana[?], the Captain-General of Santa Fe ; <lb/>his Secretary, Ramirez, has arrived at Carthagena with <lb/>the above intelligence ; it was also added that a part <lb/>of Bolivar's army would soon be in Mempaz[?].</p>
                <p>There have arrived at the port of Quebec, this pre<lb break="no"/>sent season 9,513 settlers.</p>
                <p>A letter from Demerara of the 14th August says <lb/>that a severe shock of an earthquake had been felt in <lb/>that colony for the first time since the memory of man[?]. <lb/>It occurred on the 12th. and continued for 30 se<lb break="no"/>cond[?].</p>
                <p>"Madras, April 14. <lb/>"The gratifying intelligence of the fall of Asser<lb break="no"/>ghur reached the Presidency yesterday. We wait with <lb/>impatience for the official details.</p>
                <p>"Madras, April 17. <lb/>It is with since regret that we announce the death <lb/>of John Duncan, Esq. third Member of the Medical <lb/>Board at this Presidency, at General Lang's gardens. <lb/>On Saturday last, the 10th instant. The funeral took <lb/>place on Sunday evening, with the honours due to his <lb/>rank ; and is remains were attended to the place of <lb/>internment by a numerous assemblage of his friends at <lb/>the Presidency. Mr Duncan's valuable services were <lb/>for mroe than 30 years devoted to the benefit of the <lb/>public, and the relief of suffering humanity[?] ; and dur<lb break="no"/>ing the whole of that period, it may be truly said, that <lb/>he always evinced a firm, humane[?], and honourable dis<lb break="no"/>position, the remembrance of which must render his <lb/>memory universally respected.</p>
                <p>"Calcutta, March 24. <lb/>"A Treaty has been concluded by the Hon. Sir <lb/>Stamford Raffles[?], on the part of the Most Noble the <lb/>Governor-General, with the Sultan of Jahore and To<lb break="no"/>mangong of Sincapore, establishing a British Residen<lb break="no"/>cy at the latter place, under Major Furqubar, with a <lb/>settlement on the ruins of the ancient captial of that <lb/>country, over which, we may congratulate our readers, <lb/>that the British flag is now flying ; Sir S. Raffles hav<lb break="no"/>ing returned from this expedition to Penang[?] on the <lb/>4th of last month. The grant of this island, which is <lb/>situated at the southern extremity of the Peninsula of <lb/>Malacca[?] must become valuable to the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, especially when accompanied, as we understand <lb/>that it is, with the privilege of establishing further set<lb break="no"/>tlements along the extensive coast of Jahore, which <lb/>must afford considerable protection to our commerce <lb/>in that quarter, particularly to ships passing through <lb/>the Straits, and enable us to watch the proceedings of <lb/>our Bataxian competitors.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Cape Town Gazettes</hi>  to the 1st of August have come <lb/>to our hands. At the present moment, when plans for <lb/>colonising the territory adjoining the Cape of Good <lb/>Hope, occupy so much attention, we turn to these pa<lb break="no"/>pers with peculiar anxiety. They, however, contain <lb/>little notice of public events at the Cape ; and nothing <lb/>whatever is said of the incursions of the Caffres. We <lb/>collect incidentally, that the scarcity which lately pre<lb break="no"/>vailed at the Cape has entirely ceased ; ample supplies <lb/>of wheat and flour having lately been imported or <lb/>brought to market.</p>
                <p>Maritime Intelligence</p>
                <p>Friday, a Court Martial was assembled on board the <lb/>Queen Charlotte, in Portsmouth harbour, and con<lb break="no"/>tinued by adjournment during Saturday, to inquire into <lb/>the circumstances of the supposed concealment of two <lb/>deserters from the band of the 18th regiment of foot <lb/>on board his Majesty's ships Phaeton[?], Captain W. H. <lb/>Dillon, in the month of October last, when that ship <lb/>was about to proceed to the East Indies; and to try <lb/>Lieutenant John Geary, the first Lieutenant of the said <lb/>ship, for his conduct upon that occasion. The Court[?] <lb/>was crowded with officers, &amp;c. from the shore each <lb/>day. The prosecution was closed on Saturday after<lb break="no"/>nnoon, and the Court adjourned till ten o'clock on Mon<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>day, when Lieutenant Geary made his defence. The <lb/>Court having considered the whole of the evidence, were <lb/>of opinion that the charge was proved, and sentenced <lb/>him to be dismissed his Majesty's ship Phaeton, and <lb/>severely reprimanded.</p>
                <p>Letters from Port Jackson, New South Wales, dated <lb/>March 30th, were receivedon Sunday. The ships Sur<lb break="no"/>rey and Lord Sidmouth, with convicts from England, <lb/>arrived on the 4th and 11th March. A schooner of <lb/>80 tons burden, intended for the Chief of the Society <lb/>Islands, was to be launched on the 7th of April. The <lb/>Shipley, with dispatches and troops on board, was to <lb/>sail on the first, and may, therefore, be expected daily <lb/>in this country.</p>

                <p>The mail will convey to you sufficiently afflicting <lb/>news of the voyages which the fever is committing <lb/>amongst us. Part of the 92nd and 50th have made <lb/>their escape on board the Serapis 64, which has been <lb/>roofed to, and most handsomely and humanely given <lb/>up by the Admiral for the use of the troops. The <lb/>loss in men stands about thus: 59th[?], 200[?] ; 92d, 120. <lb/>The 58th and 81st are scattered[?] ; but from all I can <lb/>learn, their loss is not great. The following is a list <lb/>of the officers and their relatives who have fallen vic<lb break="no"/>tims in the course of this month : –</p>
                <p>Lieut.-Colonel Sparrow, Deputy Adjt.-General. <lb/>Lieut.-Colonel [?], 52d regiment. <lb/>Lieut.-Colonel Hill th[?] regiment. <lb/>Major Rowe, 50th regiment, son-in-law of Pay<lb break="no"/>master Montgomery, of the 50th. <lb/>Mrs Rowe, wife of Major Rowe, whom she surviv<lb break="no"/>ed but a few hours, and daughter of Paymaster Mont<lb break="no"/>gomery. <lb/>Major Montgomery, 50th, son of Paymaster Mont<lb break="no"/>gomery. <lb/>Mrs Montgomery, wife of ditto. <lb/>Assistant Surgeon Brown, 50th, son in-law of do. <lb/>Lieut. Richardson, 50th. <lb/>Lieut. North[?], 50th. <lb/>Lieut. and Adjutant Lyon, 50th. <lb/>Two Misses Lyon, daughter of Adjutant Lyon. <lb/>Lieuts. R. M'Donald and George Mackie, 92d. <lb/>Ensign [?] [?]th <lb/>Doctor [?], Medical Staff. <lb/>Captain and Paymaster Turner, 58th. <lb/>The Misses Baxter, daughters of Quarter-Master <lb/>Baxter[?].</p>
                <p>The scenes that have occurred during this awful <lb/>mortality have been most distressing. It has not been <lb/>confined to the military, for the inhabitants have even <lb/>out numbered them.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The Quebec Mercury</hi>  of the [?] gives long extracts <lb/>from the American papers, respecting the [?] of a <lb/>large tract of country by the [?] Indians, to the <lb/>British Government, 2,748,000 acres, stretching from <lb/>the upper part of the midland[?] district towards the lower <lb/>part of the province, in the rear of the old settlements <lb/>on the Ottawa, and not in any manner coming into <lb/>contact with or approach within many miles of the <lb/>boundary of Louisiana. Yet, upon the supposition <lb/>that Great Britain is thus extending her Canadian ter<lb break="no"/>ritory, the American Papers are loud in their invectives <lb/>against this country.</p>
                <p>Letters have been received from Mogadoru[?], dated <lb/>the 28th September, which mention, that the plague <lb/>which had been for some time in the vicinity, had at <lb/>length broken out in that town. We are happy to add <lb/>however, that the deaths at that period were only three <lb/>or four each day, and it was then confined to the <lb/>Moors ; none of the Christians or Jews having fallen <lb/>victims to the pestilence. The weather being extreme<lb break="no"/>ly cold, great hopes were entertained that the further <lb/>progress of the disease would speedily be put a stop to <lb/>when trade, which then at a stand, would renew <lb/>its wanted[?] activity. The whole population of Moga<lb break="no"/>doru is between 10 and 12,000 persons ; by far the <lb/>greater part of whom consider it contrary to their reli<lb break="no"/>gious tenets to use any caution to prevent their taking <lb/>the infection ; and, in the event of their having it <lb/>would not, for the same reason, have recourse to any <lb/>means to counteract it.</p>

            </p>
                <p>[ From the Observer. ]</p>
                <p>The following letter from a lady who emigra<lb break="no"/>ted to America, from within four miles of Godal<lb break="no"/>ming, in Surrey, two years back, has been hand<lb break="no"/>ed to us for insertion. During the present rage <lb/>for emigration, we think we are justified in giv<lb break="no"/>ing it insertion, leaving it to those who are inte<lb break="no"/>rested in its contents to draw their own con <lb/>clusions. We have reason to conclude that the <lb/>letter is genuine, and is not, we believe, as many <lb/>have been which have found their way into the <lb/>public press, the produce of ingenuity on this <lb/>side the Atlantic: –</p>
                <p>Philadelphia, July 29. 1818</p>
                <p>"My dear Sir – I have received your welcome letter, to<lb break="no"/>gether with the patterns you were kind enough to forward <lb/>Although our habits here are in many respects different from <lb/>those on your side of the Atlantic, yet, I assure, there is a <lb/>considerable degree of anxiety among our American belles for <lb/>English fasions ; and the display which your prompt atten<lb break="no"/>tion to my request has enabled me to make, has procured me <lb/>not alone a great influx of visitors, but of business. You ask <lb/>me to give you my candid opinion of the policy of removing <lb/>hither with your wife and family. I can have no hesitation in <lb/>complying with this request ; but, at the same time, I shrink <lb/>from the responsibility of your being persuade, from any <lb/>things which I may say, to follow my example. It is impossible <lb/>to disguise from myself, and I would not attempt to disguise <lb/>it from you, that many who have come here, anticipating pro<lb break="no"/>sperity and independence, have failed ; but, at the same time, <lb/>as far as my humble observation has enabled me to judge, I <lb/>am persuaded that many of those failures have been the result <lb/>of unpardonable imprudence, and the absence of that activity <lb/>and spirit of perseverance, by which persons depending on <lb/>their own exertions can alone expect to succeed. I have seen <lb/>many individuals here reduced to very melancholy straits from <lb/>having left their native shores thoughtlessly, without more <lb/>money than was sufficient to support them for a fortnight. –. <lb/>This has been dissipated, on their landing, almost before they <lb/>had recovered the effects of a long and fatiguing voyage ; and <lb/>being thus reduced to extremity, their spirits have failed, and <lb/>they have at once sunk into a state of apathy and listless de<lb break="no"/>spair. Those who have labouring and mechanic trades to <lb/>follow, and will sumbit to degradation, as some of them <lb/>call it, of becoming journeymen, do tolerably well.</p>
                <p>"With regards to myself, I need not recall to your mind the <lb/>species of drudgery to which I was forced to submit, in order <lb/>to support a decent appearance in London. You often joked <lb/>me on my enterprising disposition, and doubted my resolution <lb/>to come to this country in search of that independence which <lb/>I foresaw I could never obtain at home. Here I am, however, <lb/>and an hour since I had the pleasure of paying 30 work wo<lb break="no"/>men, the lowest of whose weekly wages, I those who <lb/>take their work home, is five dollars! You will start at this <lb/>and so will Mrs B. It is, however, no less true than extraordi<lb break="no"/>nary. In short I have every reason to be grateful to Providence <lb/>for having given me the confidence to sufficient to try an experiment <lb/>which has turned out so fortunately. I have commenced both <lb/>millinery and dress-making, to which I have added the child<lb break="no"/>bed and ready made linen business ; and in every one of <lb/>branches I am full of orders. My most sanguine hopes <lb/>have been realized. My capital at the beginning was exactly <lb/>1.60 Sterling and a few of those articles of stock which <lb/>were necessary to make a show. These, combined with the <lb/>attractive titled of " Miss P–, from London,'&amp;c. in a <lb/>few weeks set me afloat in a surprising manner. I did my <lb/>utmost to please my customers, and, in a few months, moved <lb/>from a situation of obscurity to one of the first respecta<lb break="no"/>bility. I am thus particular because I know you feel an <lb/>interest in my fate. My brother James, who you know <lb/>is a bricklayer and builder, has been equally fortunate.– <lb/>He has had several contracts, and is now building a row of <lb/>twenty houses, besides other jobs of a smaller description.</p>
                <p>"Of the other fiften persons who accompanied us from <lb/>Godalmbing and its neighbourhood I am proud to say they <lb/>have all been tolerably successful. The greater part of them, <lb/>you know, were farmers, and they are now settled in farms <lb/>of from fifty to five hundred acres, from one hundred to one <lb/>thousand miles from this place. All these, hoever, came <lb/>out with small capitals–but none with less than myself–and <lb/>husbanding their resources, and abstaining from extravagance <lb/>of every description, they finally successed in laying the <lb/>foundation of their own future happiness.</p>
                <p>We all have our own prejudices in favour of our old habits ; <lb/>but this must wear off in the course of time?other there <lb/>is a roughness and absence of what we call "good manners" <lb/>about some of the Americans, not at all congenial to English <lb/>taste. They are for the most part, however, hospitable ; <lb/>and if you let them have their way, and do not thwart their <lb/>humours, are really very kind, and disposed to friendly inter<lb break="no"/>course. You talk to carrying your family to the Western <lb/>states–to the Illinois country, and of commencing farmer <lb/>and storekeeping there. It is probably that your views may be <lb/>very correct, but I think you may settle nearer to us, if not <lb/>at so cheap a rate, at best with a greater certainty of present <lb/>comfort. Of the Western States, I, of course, can know no<lb break="no"/>thing but by report. The emigration in that direction has <lb/>been immense, but the journey to some has been so long, as <lb/>frequently to produce repentance before the destined goal was <lb/>reached. We have had several English, Scotch, and Irish fa<lb break="no"/>milies here, on the way to Pittsburgh, who, I understand, <lb/>were bound for Mr Birkbeck's settlement ; but I have not <lb/>heard of their arrival. The greater part have gone down the <lb/>Ohio in arks, which you say you have seen described in Birk<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>beck's books. No doubt these people must have to encounter <lb/>great privations, and perhaps some danger ; time and perseve<lb break="no"/>rance, however,will overcome all difficulties, and from the na<lb break="no"/>tural course of things, in the end the great object in view, plenty <lb/>and independence, must be attained ; and this as you very <lb/>justly say, is "worth a struggle." Upon the whole, if you can <lb/>be content to give up all those luxuries of which an English <lb/>fireside is the scene ; to abandon the habits of social inter<lb break="no"/>course to which an English neighbourhood give encou<lb break="no"/>ragement ; and to derive happiness from the consciousness of <lb/>seeing yourself surrounded by an abundance of the necessaries <lb/>of life alone ; you cannot fail of success. I agree with you, <lb/>that a vast deal of the pleasure of England are counterbalan<lb break="no"/>ced by the castant visitation of the tax-gathered. From these, <lb/>at least you will be free here ; and as for society, your own <lb/>family, large as it is, must be a treasure in itself ; added to <lb/>which, in proportion as wealth increases, civilisation must <lb/>follow. If you could get three or four families with whom <lb/>you are acquainted, to join in your plans and settle in your <lb/>neighbourhood, an additional assuance of success and happi<lb break="no"/>ness would be attained.</p>
                <p>"As to capital, I think you ought to hav, on your land<lb break="no"/>ing here, L. 500, which, with moderate exertions and com<lb break="no"/>mon good fortune, must afford yo uthe means of certain <lb/>prosperity. I shall, however, write again in September on <lb/>this subject, when I intend sending for my sister, and per<lb break="no"/>haps the information I may be able to collect in the interim <lb/>will confirm your plans, and induce you to accompany her to <lb/>this side of the water. I rather think we shall shortly have <lb/>another cargo from Surrey ; I will let you know every parti<lb break="no"/>cular in my next, as well as send you a list of the things, <lb/>which it will be policy for you to bring with you. Your <lb/>seven children, instead of being a burden to you here, will <lb/>form one of the most prominent sources of your wealth."</p>
