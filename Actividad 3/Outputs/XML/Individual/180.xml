                <p><pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p>We have received Canada Papers to the 10th May. <lb/>The active exertions of the Governor to improve the <lb/>inland navigation had given very general satisfaction. <lb/>In the course of the Session of the Colonial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, which was prorogued on the 14th April, no less <lb/>than three Addresses were presented to Earl Dalhou<lb break="no"/>sie, to be forwarded to the King ; one respecting the <lb/>allowance of half-pay to the Militia ; another respect<lb break="no"/>ing the duties imposed in British ports on lumber from <lb/>Canada ; and third related to the losses sustained <lb/>by the people of Canada, during the late war. His <lb/>excellency the Governor had intimated, that no objec<lb break="no"/>tion would be made to the repeal of the grant of 2,500l <lb/>on account of the Civil List for the Colony, provided <lb/>the salaray of the Chief retired Justice, the Receiver<lb break="no"/>General, and that of the Speaker of the House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly, should be continued, in the whole amounting <lb/>to 1,800l. The grant has for some time been a pro<lb break="no"/>minent subject of complaint in the Colonial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment.</p>
                <p>The 37th Regiment for three years stationed in <lb/>Lower Canada is about to leave the Colony for Eng<lb break="no"/>land. The Staff Corps was to proceed to the Otta<lb break="no"/>wa, to carry into effect the intended plan for removing <lb/>the obstructions in that river.</p>
                <p>An article from Montreal, dated May 5, states, that <lb/>a messenger was leaving that place to announce the <lb/>union of the North and Hudson's Bay Compa<lb break="no"/>nies, at their respective establishments. The former <lb/>of these companies was under control of Lord Sel<lb break="no"/>kirk, and the schism that has so long reigned between <lb/>them, with its fatal consequences, is well know to <lb/>the Public.</p>
                <p>By Letters from Bombay we learn that 20 ships <lb/>have been taken up by the vigilant Governor, on board <lb/>of which 5000 troops are embarked, destined to the <lb/>Persian Gulph, to repair the disaster suffered by the <lb/>surprise of the detachment left by Sir Wm. Kier, un<lb break="no"/>der the direction of a young man. The gallant Gen. <lb/>Lionel Smith has been selected for this important ser<lb break="no"/>vice ; and we have no doubt but that he will convince <lb/>the Arabs of the impolicy of their treacherous proceed<lb break="no"/>ings, and justify the high confidence which the Go<lb break="no"/> <lb/>vernment of Bombay have in his talents and valour.– <lb/>His Excellency Mr. Elphinstone, completely recover<lb break="no"/>ed, is gone on a tour to Kutch, to settle all disputes, <lb/>and to ascertain the true situation of the country.– <lb/>How important it is for the Heads of the Presidencies, <lb/>thus to judge from actual observation, instead of trust<lb break="no"/>ing to mere reports. This proves the benefits of ap<lb break="no"/>pointing men of experience and energy in the conduct <lb/>of our Indian Empire–which is now, throuh the <lb/>admirable conduct of the Governor General, and the two <lb/>other Presidencies, in a state of unexampled, tranqui<lb break="no"/>lity and prosperity.</p>
