                <p>QUEBEC, <hi rend="italic">December</hi>  2, 1790 <lb/>Yesterday's post from Montreal, conveyed let<lb break="no"/>ters to several gentlemen in town, all corroborati<lb break="no"/>ing the following extract.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="smallcaps">SIR</hi>, <lb/>"I have to inform you by several letters re<lb break="no"/>ceived here on Saturday from Detroit, "we are <lb/>informed the Americans, under General Sinclair, <lb/>had been twice defeated, about the 19th ult. with <lb/>the loss of from 500 to 600 men, by the Indians <lb/>The Indians first attacked a body of 300 horse <lb/>which they had drawn into a snare, and cut the <lb/>whole of them off. In a second engagement, they <lb/>were likewise victorious, having nearly killed as <lb/>many. On account of which, Sinclair thought <lb/>proper to retreat; and the last accounts state the <lb/>Indians having divided themselves into small par<lb break="no"/>ties, had so harrassed him, that he was obliged to <lb/>leave the wounded in the field–Sinclair lost his <lb/>artillery, a cohorn, and grass-hopper. It is said <lb/>the Indians are very much elated at their success, <lb/>and that numbers were daily joining them, at <lb/>their head quarters, about the Maimis towns– <lb/>One Indian, it is said, killed 30 with his own <lb/>hand.</p>
                <p>"The Indians were extremely civil to the <lb/>traders from Detriot, having assisted them, when <lb/>they knew of the approach of the Americans, to <lb/>remove their property to safety, except ammuni<lb break="no"/>tion and arms. These are facts so well ascertain<lb break="no"/>ed, that there does not remain the least doubt <lb/>of them:</p>
                <p>They may be attended with very serious and <lb/>important consequences to the province, as I dare <lb/>say, all will be imputed to the British for supply<lb break="no"/>ing these Indians with arms and ammunition.– <lb/>In short, I would not be surprized to hear of an <lb/>American army raising, to attack this country. <lb/>* The loss is here specified, but other letters differing <lb/>in number, we shall only say, the estimate in general <lb/>does not appear considerable.</p>
