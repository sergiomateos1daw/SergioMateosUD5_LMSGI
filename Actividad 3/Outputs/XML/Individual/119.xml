                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Canada Papers.</hi></p>
                <p>Montreal, Oct. 5. <lb/>On the afternoon of Saturday last, the specie <lb/>seized on board the Lake Champlain steam-boat, <lb/>amounting to upward of 12,000 dollars, arrived <lb/>at his Majesty's cash-office here, under the es<lb break="no"/>cort of the 19th light dragoons from St John's.</p>
                <p>At length we have authentic accounts relating <lb/>to the expedition of Lord Selkirk ; they are very <lb/>important, as many <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi>  details have been <lb/>published - his taking Fort William by storm, <lb/>making all the partners of the North West Com<lb break="no"/>pany prisoners, &amp;c. ; but the cause of the expe <lb/>dition has never been explained. The Canadian <lb/>Courant puts it in a very clear point of view:â€“ <lb/>Mr Robert Semple, the Governor-General <lb/>The Hudson's Bay Company on the Red River, <lb/>towards the close of the year 1815, took posses<lb break="no"/>sion of two establishments belonging to the North <lb/>West Company, which had obtruded themselves <lb/>on the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company. <lb/>The North West traders then altered their <lb/>route, going into the Upper Country by circuit<lb break="no"/>ous ways, by which much delay took place ; and <lb/>in order to try Mr Semple, they sent two cart<lb break="no"/>loads of provisions by the former track in June <lb/>last, with a guard of fifty men ; the advance, <lb/>twenty-two of the number, fell in with one of <lb/>the natives, whom they took forward with them <lb/>to prevent discovery. The rear-guard passed <lb/>within four miles of the settlement ; they were <lb/>perceived by the Governor, and were attacked <lb/>by a party from the garrison, consisting of about <lb/>thirty soldiers ; an engagement took place, stat<lb break="no"/>ed on the 19th of June. Mr Semple and 21 <lb/>of his men were killed ; the rest of his forces <lb/>returned defeated to the fort ; it is on this ac<lb break="no"/>count that the expedition of Lord Selkirk was <lb/>undertaken. The manner of Lord Selkirk's con<lb break="no"/>ducting the expedition we do not justify, nor in<lb break="no"/>deed can we form any opinion on the subject <lb/>without further authentic details ; it is, however, <lb/>but justice to say, that the Hudson's Bay Com<lb break="no"/>pany have rights, and are a chartered Company ; <lb/>the North West Traders, though we believe a <lb/>most respectable body, are only an Association <lb/>of Merchants.</p>
