                <p><pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Success of the Cutch Expedition against the Sindeans </hi><lb/>–The following extract of a letter from Bombay <lb/>bringing this intelligence, we copy from Carrick's <lb/>Post, which appears to have exclusive means of obtain<lb break="no"/>ing information on India affairs:–</p>
                <p>"Bombay, Sept. 12, 1820. <lb/>"While I was seeing the last of your goods on <lb/>board, last night, a vessel arrived in the harbour hav<lb break="no"/>ing on board an officer from Cutch, who was the hear<lb break="no"/>er of the official intelligence of the complete success <lb/>of Sir Charles Culville's expedition against the Sin<lb break="no"/>deans. The expedition consisted of 12,000 men, <lb/>commanded by his Excellency the Commander in <lb/>Chief ; from all I could clean of intellience from the <lb/>followers, it appeared there had been some hard fight<lb break="no"/>ing for five days ; but it ended, as might be anticipat<lb break="no"/>ed, from the imposing force sent against the Sindeans. <lb/>The moment the officer (who is one of the Staff, and <lb/>an Irishman) landed, he set out for the Government <lb/>House, to inform Lady Colville of the event, as it <lb/>must be supposed she was in a state og anxiety, her <lb/>husband being the commander, and her brother, and <lb/>her uncle, Colonel T. Blair, being also on the expe<lb break="no"/>dition. At day-light this morning orders arrived from <lb/>the Government House, to secure a passage and pri<lb break="no"/>vate cabin for the officer in th ship which takes this <lb/>to England, but there was no such accomodation, as <lb/>the cabins were all full ; and as another vessel will not <lb/>sail from thence about ten days, this and will be off <lb/>to-day, the chance is, you will have this letter at least <lb/>six weeks before the officers can reach England with <lb/>the official intelligence. All kinds of European pro<lb break="no"/>duce are a drug hee, paricularly fine goods ; and <lb/>rum, brandy, and geneva, are for a song. The cho<lb break="no"/>lera has rather abated, but still rages in a frightful <lb/>manner."</p>
                <p>The Rio Janeiro packet arrived on Tuesday with let<lb break="no"/>ters to the 21st of November. Advices had been re<lb break="no"/>ceived from Rio Grande, stating that Artigas had been <lb/>taken prisoner. The Portuguese frigate, Union, had <lb/>captured two insurgent privateers which had been com<lb break="no"/>mitting depredations on the coast. The events in Por<lb break="no"/>tugal, owing to which, as well as to the idea that the <lb/>King would be prudent enough to sanction what had <lb/>taken place in Portugal, the prices of produce had ex<lb break="no"/>perienced very trifling alteration, though, if the con<lb break="no"/>trary should be the case, a considerable rise was anti<lb break="no"/>cipated. The following relates to what is passing in <lb/>Peru :–</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter from Rio Janeiro, dated Novem<lb break="no"/>ber 20 :–" The Chilians have at length carried into <lb/>effect their boasted expedition, which left Valparaiso <lb/>on the 21st August, and arrived at Pisco at the begin<lb break="no"/>ning of September. San Martin landed 4,500 men, <lb/>but the blacks, cattle, &amp;c. had all been previously sent <lb/>away from the estates in that quarter, so that they will <lb/>be disappointed in meeting with partisans ; indeed the <lb/>slaves and lower orders, whom they expected to find <lb/>favourable to their views, are the most irritated against <lb/>the insurgents. We have letters from Lima to the 12th <lb/>September, which speaks of the little apprehensions en<lb break="no"/>tertained of San Martin and his troops, the Viceroy <lb/>having a formidable force, in the capital and vicinity, <lb/>of 8,000 men, commanded by good officers. The <lb/>Viceroy, is Commander-in-Chief, La Serna, second, <lb/>and La Mar and O'Reilly command divisions. They <lb/>were observin San Martin's movements who already <lb/>experienced the difficulties of subsisting his men. The <lb/>Marquis of Vallembrozo was on his flank, with a <lb/>strong detachment of cavalry, with a view to prevent <lb/>him from sending emissaries into the interior, and col<lb break="no"/>lecting horses. It is thought the insurgents will soon <lb/>have to re-embark ; for, as soon as they are a little <lb/>pressed for provisions, and fighting comes on, num<lb break="no"/>bers will desert. Those who have already come over <lb/>describe their situation as very critical. Two vessels, <lb/>one an English, and the other a French, were prepar<lb break="no"/>ing to sail from Callao for this place, and by them we <lb/>shall receive further particulars. The most enthusias<lb break="no"/>tic preparations were making in Lima to proclaim the <lb/>constitution in a formal manner, for which purpose <lb/>orders had been received from Madrid. This of itself <lb/>is sufficient to defeat all views Cochrane and San Mar<lb break="no"/>tin may have on the country, except, as before, a lit<lb break="no"/>tle plunder on the open and defenceless parts of the <lb/>coast.</p>
                <p>Letters from Sierra Leone, dated the 24th of Nov. <lb/>mention that the whole squadron was lying there.– <lb/>The Pheasant, Myrmidon, Snapper, and Thistle, were <lb/>lying off the Cape, waiting for the Morgiana to com<lb break="no"/>plete her water, provisions, &amp;c. which ship was oblig<lb break="no"/>ed to be assisted by the squadron, in consequence of <lb/>her very sickly state. She had recently arrived from <lb/>the River Gambia, whither she had proceeded in dread <lb/>of attack by the natives on our infant colony there. <lb/>A letter of thanks had been voted to Captain Finlason, <lb/>by the merchants of that colony, for the very able man<lb break="no"/>ner in which he brought to an amicable conclusion the <lb/>differences between the Native Chiefs and the British <lb/>interests in the Gambia. The Morgania brought from <lb/>the Gambia, Dr Dochard and forty-six men belong<lb break="no"/>ing to the mission under Major Gray, for exploring <lb/>Africa. Dr D. had been at Sago ; but, in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of internal wars, he was unable to proceed <lb/>further. Major Gray was there with very few men ; <lb/>he will not proceed further for some time.</p>
