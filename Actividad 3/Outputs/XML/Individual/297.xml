                <p><pb/>On Monday a discussion of some interest took <lb/>place in the House of Commons relative to the <lb/>affairs of South Australia. Owing to certain de<lb break="no"/>fects in its government, that colony has fallen <lb/>into a state of financial embarassment requiring <lb/>immediate relief. Lord John Russell traced the <lb/>history of the settlement from its foundation, and <lb/>stated that, while its revenue does not exceed <lb/>t20,000 its expenditure has increased to the <lb/>enormous sum of t130,000 a year ! At present <lb/>its affairs are managed by commissioners, the re<lb break="no"/>sponsible Ministers of the Crown having no di<lb break="no"/>rect control over its expenditure. This is mani<lb break="no"/>festly an evil, and must form the subject of future <lb/>legislation, but in the meantime it is necessary to <lb/>provide for the payment of certain bills now <lb/>over-due. Accordingly, Lord John Russell pro<lb break="no"/>posed that her Majesty should be authorized to <lb/>guarantee a loan of t210,000 for this purpose. <lb/>Lord Stanley concurred generally in the views of <lb/>the noble Secretary for the Colonies, but though <lb/>that the Government ought not to demand a <lb/>loan until they had brought in a bill to explain <lb/>distinctly the principles on which they proposed <lb/>that the colony should henceforth be governed. <lb/>Sir Robert Peel suggested that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should ask a vote of credit for the sum re<lb break="no"/>quired, which, as it met the urgency of the case, <lb/>was ultimately agreed upon, and the subject was <lb/>deferred till Friday.</p>
