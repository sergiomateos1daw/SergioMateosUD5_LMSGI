                <p>Salus populi suprema lex.</p>
                <p><hi rend="enlarged-capital">T </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">here</hi>  wasa time when it was held pure factiousness to <lb/>doubt whether the prosperity we enjoyed during the first ten <lb/>or twelve years of the late war, was perfectly sound and na<lb break="no"/>tural, and whether it would not ultimately entail upon us a <lb/>corresponding share of future calamity. But the most gloomy <lb/>anticipations of those who were most inclined to view the pic<lb break="no"/>ture on the dark side have certainly come infinitely short of <lb/>the full measure of distress and misery which have at length <lb/>fallen upon the country. It would be unjust to charge the <lb/>Government with any more of these evils than might have <lb/>been foreseen ; but now that they force themselves on the at<lb break="no"/>tention on all sides, it is perfectly fair to hold the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment accountable for all that it can remove or prevent, and <lb/>yet suffers to exist. This is the first time, we believe, in mo<lb break="no"/>dern history, when the evil of an excess, of population has come <lb/>so distinctly under the notice of a Government as to call for <lb/>a legislative remedy. The case is therefore new, and the <lb/>course to be pursued is the less obvious ; but the war was a <lb/>season of bold experiments, in which we surmounted many <lb/>difficulties once deemed insuperable : and if timidity tie up our <lb/>hands now, when humanity calls upon us to move, the world <lb/>may well say, that the boasted energy of the Government has <lb/>been entirely reserved for the supply of its own wants out of <lb/>the pockets of the people, but that, when a period of public <lb/>calamity requiress exertions of a more painful kind, it is start<lb break="no"/>led by the smallest difficulty, and will not even make such <lb/>a slight effort as might evince its sympathy with the sufferers.</p>
                <p>During the late war, the industry of the country was stimu<lb break="no"/>lated into a state of unprecedented activity, by the monopoly <lb/>we obtained of the commerce of the world–by thirty or forty <lb/>millions of the capital of the country being annually melted <lb/>down and consumed–and by the continual rise of prices pro<lb break="no"/>duced by the depreciation of the currency. The great de<lb break="no"/>mand for labour, arising out of this state of things, with the <lb/>consequent increase of wages, caused a rapid augmentation in <lb/>the numbers of the people. In the ten years ending 1811, the <lb/>rate of increase in Britain was such as would have doubled the <lb/>population in fifty-two years; and in the great manufacturing <lb/>districts it probably equalled what takes place in a new colony. <lb/>When the peace came, and was followed by the destruction of <lb/>our commercial monopoly, the cessation of the annual loans, <lb/>and the diminuition of the paper issues, the sources of our fic<lb break="no"/>titious prosperity were dried up at once : a vast reduction took <lb/>place in the demand for labour ; profits and wages fell with <lb/>prices ; while the pressure of the taxes were doubled, and one<lb break="no"/>third added to their real amount by the rise in the value of <lb/>money. The laws, however, which regulate the multiplication <lb/>of human beings, cannot instantly bend to circumstances : a <lb/>long period necessarily elapses before the population accom<lb break="no"/>modates itself to the diminished demand for labour, and dur<lb break="no"/>ing this period the labouring classes must suffe extreme mi<lb break="no"/>sery. In this state we are at present, and time, from which <lb/>we hoped relief, has only aggravated the evil. There are but <lb/>three remedies upon which any dependence can be placed <lb/>– a reduction of taxation – a change in our commercial <lb/>system – and emigration. We have little hopes as to the first, <lb/>since this would require a sacrifice on the part of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of its own interest, real or supposed, which we see no <lb/>disposition to make. A relaxation in our restrictive commer<lb break="no"/>cial system has not the same obstacles to encounter, and we <lb/>have repeated shewn that it would be highly beneficial. The <lb/>reluctance of Ministers to attempt a change that may prejudice <lb/>the interest of some particular classes, might be considered as <lb/>a prudent caution, were it not observed, that when, instead of <cb/>relieving the distress of the people, the object is to suppy the <lb/>necessities of the Treasury, none of this caution appears, but <lb/>the complaints of the sufferers are disregarded as vulgar cla<lb break="no"/>mour. But the crisis is now such, that tenderness to the in<lb break="no"/>terests of a few individuals may be cruelty to the public at <lb/>large. Though we shall preach free trade to other nations ra<lb break="no"/>ther with a bad grace, when we can no longer hold our mono<lb break="no"/>poly, it is so far well that our misfortunes are at last likely to <lb/>open our eyes to truths whch were familiar to philosophers <lb/>half a century ago. In our present circumstances, we may <lb/>perhaps almost be thankful, that a systematic error, which has <lb/>impeded our career, has kept this one resource open to us.</p>
                <p>Emigration suggests itself so naturally as a remedy for a re<lb break="no"/>dundant population, that we are rather surprised there should <lb/>be much reluctance to have recourse to it. We need not <lb/>be afraid that the practise will continue longer than the ne<lb break="no"/>cessity which produces it. " The <hi rend="italic">vis intertiae</hi>  of people in ge<lb break="no"/>neral, says <hi rend="smallcaps">Malthus</hi>, and their attachment to their homes, <lb/>are qualities so strong and general, that we may rest assured <lb/>they will not emigrate, unless, from political discontents or ex<lb break="no"/>treme poverty, they are in such a state, <hi rend="italic">as will make it as much </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">for the advantages of their country as of themselves that they </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">should go out of it.</hi> " We by no means underrate the difficul<lb break="no"/>ties that attend emigration upon a large scale, but these are <lb/>partly occasioned by the absurd practise of directing it exclu<lb break="no"/>sively to our own colonies. We have vast multitudes, whom <lb/>we can neither feed nor employ ; and surely the first and most <lb/>pressing object is to send them where they will find the means <lb/>of subsistence. There are many parts of the world besides our <lb/>own colonies open to receive them. And whether they go to <lb/>the United States, Brazil, Buenos Ayres, or to Canada, New <lb/>Holland, or the Cape of Good Hope, the advantage to this <lb/>country will be nearly the same. Among so many countries <lb/>of such extent, it would not be very difficult to dispose of half <lb/>a million of persons (young and old) within the course perhaps <lb/>of two years. But upon whatever scale emigration is conduct<lb break="no"/>ed it must be gradual; and this renders it the more important <lb/>to fix upon a plan early. Ministers have lately announced <lb/>that Canada cannot receive more emigrants at present with<lb break="no"/>out inconvenience. But had the intention of sending great <lb/>numbers to that colony been made public two years ago, corn <lb/>would have been raised for them, and men of some capital, <lb/>assured of finding abundance of labourers, would have gone <lb/>out and settled, and provided employment for those who have <lb/>not the means to establish themselves as farmers. The alarm <lb/>we feel of seeing manufactures raised up in other countries by <lb/>the skill of our expatriated artisans is very ill founded. Many <lb/>other advantges must be combined with the possession of <lb/>mechanical skill to make manufactures flourish ; and when the <lb/>former are found, able workmen will not be long wanting. Our <lb/>capital, our improved means of internal communication, our <lb/>coal fields, our laws for the protection of industry and proper<lb break="no"/>ty, the free, enlightened and active spirit of our people, with the <lb/>powers of combination resulting from the union of so many <lb/>advantages within so small a space, are better securities for <lb/>our superiority in manufactures, than attempts, which must be <lb/>nugatory, to retain a monopoly of operative skill and talent. <lb/>But the opinion which exists in foreign countries, as to the su<lb break="no"/>periority of our people in every branch of industry, will have <lb/>this good effect, that it will secure out emigrants a favourable <lb/>reception. Though the emigration, to afford any sensible re<lb break="no"/>lief to the whole country, would require to be upon an exten<lb break="no"/>sive scale, it is yet obvious, that even upon the smallest scale <lb/>it is beneficial. If six labourers are withdrawn from a small <lb/>village, or fifty from a country town, the situation of either <lb/>will be improved. The plan hitherto acted on by Government <lb/>of givingassistance to those only who could raise ten on fif<lb break="no"/>teen pounds, is chiefly objectionable, because it must restrict <lb/>the emigration within very narrow limits. If by sending away <lb/>men who are still able to subsist by their labour, others now <lb/>living on charity get employment, we are in effect relieved of <lb/>so many paupers. But the former are less disposed to leave <cb/>the country ; and with regard to those who are or must soon <lb/>become paupers, it will certainly be found more economical to <lb/>pay ten or fiften pounds each to send them abroad, than to <lb/>maintain them permanently home. It is in vain, however, <lb/>to look to private charity for the funds necessary for such an <lb/>undertaking. These must be raised by the country at large ; <lb/>and whether a tax be imposed for the special purpose, or mo<lb break="no"/>ney destined for other objects be applied to this, the country, <lb/>we have no doubt, is ready to make the sacrifice. Suppose that <lb/>even so great a sum as five millions were required, this is but <lb/>the half of what England alone pays every year for poor rates ; <lb/>and what is such a sum, if it were to afford certain relief on <lb/>an emergency lke the present? If the French and Dutch should <lb/>again disagree about the navigation of the Scheldt, or if we should <lb/>quarrel with the French or Americans about the traffic in a few <lb/>hundred wild cat-skins on the other side of the globe, how <lb/>easily would a sum ten times as large be found? Nothing <lb/>more is requisite than to take on half of the sum for two <lb/>years, which Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Vansittart</hi>  allots for paying off the nation<lb break="no"/>al debt. We not only conceive that it would be wise and <lb/>creditable to divert a part, or the whole of the actual Sinking <lb/>Fund to this purpose ; but we go so far as to think, that it is lit<lb break="no"/>tle less than disgraceful to pay off any debt at all at this crisis <lb/>with funds wrung from the earnings of a starving population. <lb/>Whatever is done, it is of vast importance to understand, that <lb/>the most pressing evil, though not absolutely permanent in its <lb/>nature, cannot be expected to subside of itself for many years. <lb/>We have not only an excess of population to dispose of, but <lb/>we have to check the principle of increase, which is rapidly <lb/>aggravating the evil. In the five years ending 1810, the po<lb break="no"/>pulation of England added one-seventieth part to its numbers <lb/>annually ; and if we suppose the ratio to have been the same <lb/>for the whole empire, each year must have had 250,000 indi<lb break="no"/>viduals more to provide for than the preceding. Till the <lb/>whole of this vast annual inrease is got rid of, the present <lb/>excess of numbers will not diminish but augment. And how <lb/>is it to be got rid of? Either the annual births must diminish <lb/>more than one-third, or famine and disease must destroy a <lb/>quarter of a million of human beings annually beyond the u<lb break="no"/>sual rate of mortality, or these two causes must operate toge<lb break="no"/>ther. Notwithstanding, therefore, the misery of the labouring <lb/>classes at this moment, we doubt whether the population is <lb/>not still on the increase, and whether still more afflicting <lb/>scenes are not awaiting us. Indeed, unless measures are taken <lb/>to do away the factitious stimulus which the English poor<lb break="no"/>laws give to the increase of population, the most abundant e<lb break="no"/> <lb/>migration will prove but a feeble palliative. These are rather <lb/>discouraging circumstances ; but the evil must be dealt with in <lb/>some way, or it will ultimately overwhelm us. It has now be<lb break="no"/>come rather a question of humanitiy than of policy. One or <lb/>two millions of human beings have been suddenly deprived of <lb/>their means of subsistence by events over which they had no <lb/>control. With such a mass of individuals goaded to despera<lb break="no"/>tion by want–a deficient crop,–a sudden revulsion in trade– <lb/>a more general exclusion of our manufactures by the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans,–any of those numerous casualties, in short to which e<lb break="no"/>very nation is exposed, would place us in a situation frightful <lb/>to contemplate. Plots and insurrections will keep up a con<lb break="no"/>tinual alarm. Neither persons nor property will be safe, and <lb/>capital will gradually leave the country. If theory were silent, <lb/>experience must now convince us, that time alone will produce <lb/>no material amelioration in our circumstances ; and the relief <lb/>which is may ultimately bring, will be obtained only through <lb/>the destruction of vast multitudes by famine and disease. In <lb/>the fifth year of peace, it is now time to look the evil in the <lb/>face, and either to make some great sacrifices for its removal, <lb/>or to brace our minds to bear the dreadful alternative. It is <lb/>in vain to disguise the matter to our own consciences. Those <lb/>who propose to leave things to what they call the course of <lb/>nature, are in substance recommending that thousands of their <lb/>fellow-creatures should be suffered to rot away from the effect <lb/>of absolute want. That such a thing should take place in the</p>
