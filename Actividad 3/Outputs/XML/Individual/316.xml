                <p><pb n="5"/><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">MONDAY</hi>, J <hi rend="smallcaps">AN</hi>. 7. </hi><lb/>By the Fanny, Capt. Bryen, arrived in twenty <lb/>four days from New York, we have American <lb/>papers, of which we give the following important <lb/>intelligence:–</p>
                <p>It is an undoubted truth, (Strange as it may <lb/>appear) that the Baron D'Carondolet, Governor <lb/>of Louisiana, and Governor O'Neal, of Pensaco<lb break="no"/> <lb/>la, have opened the shores of the King of Spain, <lb/>in West-Florida, to the Creeks and Cherokees, <lb/>and delivered them arms and ammunition in abun<lb break="no"/>dance, advising and stimulating them to go to <lb/>war against the frontier inhabitants of the United <lb/>States, and that quickly, that now or never was <lb/>the time, while the United States were engaged <lb/>with the northern tribes.</p>
                <p>On the 30th of September, about midnight <lb/>John Buchanan's station, four miles south of Nash<lb break="no"/>ville,) at which sundry families had collected, and <lb/>fifteen gunmen) was attacked by a part of <lb/>Creeks and Lower Cherokees, supposed to con<lb break="no"/>sist of three of our hundred. Their approach <lb/>was suspected by the running of cattle, that had <lb/>taken fright at them, and upon examination, they <lb/>were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of <lb/>the gate, and from the place and distance they <lb/>received the first fire from the man who discover<lb break="no"/>ed them John M'Rocy. They immediately re<lb break="no"/>turned the fire, and continued a very heavy and <lb/>constant firing upon the station, blockhouses sur<lb break="no"/>rounded with a stockade for an hour, and were re<lb break="no"/>pulsed with considerable loss, without injuring <lb/>man, woman, or child, in the station.</p>
                <p>During the whole time of the attack, the In<lb break="no"/>dians were never more distant than ten yards from <lb/>the Block House, and often in large numbers <lb/>close round the lower walls, attempting to put <lb/>fire to it. One ascended the roof with a torch, <lb/>where he was shot, and falling to the ground, re<lb break="no"/>newed his attempts to fire the bottom logs, and <lb/>was killed. The Indians fired 30 balls through <lb/>a port hole of the over<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>ing, which lodged in <lb/>the roof in the circumference of the bat, and those <lb/>sticking in the walls on the outside are innume<lb break="no"/>rable.</p>
                <p>Undoubted advices have been received that as <lb/>early at the 18th of September, as many as 500 <lb/>Creeks passed the Tennessee, and the lower Chero<lb break="no"/>kee towns, and below, as on their way they de<lb break="no"/>cared to make war on Cumberland–and that they <lb/>were joined by about 100 Cherokees of those <lb/>towns.–This must have been the party that attack<lb break="no"/>ed Buchanan's station. Dreadful havoc was ex<lb break="no"/>pected, but it is now hoped, that the check they <lb/>have received will induce them to return without <lb/>making further attempts upon that settlement.</p>
                <p>On the 3d instant. Black's Block House on the <lb/>head of Crooked Creek, (a branch of Little Ri<lb break="no"/>ver) at which there was a serjeant's command, of <lb/>Cape, Crawford's company, was attacked, by sur<lb break="no"/>prise, about an hour and a half in the night, by <lb/>a party of Indians, commanded by a Cherokee of <lb/>Will's Town called the Tail, a brother of the <lb/>Bench, and Talohteske, consisting of 3 other Che<lb break="no"/>rokees and 5 Creeks.</p>
                <p>James Paul was killed in the knife, and George <lb/>Morse and Robert Sharp, at a fire on the outside <lb/>and John Shankland wounded, 3 horses were kil<lb break="no"/>led, and 7 taken off.</p>
                <p>These are the fruits of the advise of the Baron <lb/>D'Carrondolet and Governor O'Neal; and it is <lb/>due to Mr. Paton, their chief instrument, to add <lb/>he has well acted his part!!!</p>
                <p>We hear from Fayetteville (North Carolina), <lb/>that on Tuesday the 23d of October last a fire <lb/>broke out in that town, owing to the negligence <lb/>of a small negro girl, which consumed about 40 <lb/>dwelling houses and stores, and 28 buildings of <lb/>other descriptions.</p>
