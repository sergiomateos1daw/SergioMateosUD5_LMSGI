                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to America</hi></p>
                <p>[ From the Observer. ]</p>
                <p>The following letter from a lady who emigra<lb break="no"/>ted to America, from within four miles of Godal<lb break="no"/>ming, in Surrey, two years back, has been hand<lb break="no"/>ed to us for insertion. During the present rage <lb/>for emigration, we think we are justified in giv<lb break="no"/>ing it insertion, leaving it to those who are inte<lb break="no"/>rested in its contents to draw their own con <lb/>clusions. We have reason to conclude that the <lb/>letter is genuine, and is not, we believe, as many <lb/>have been which have found their way into the <lb/>public press, the produce of ingenuity on this <lb/>side the Atlantic: –</p>
                <p>Philadelphia, July 29. 1818</p>
                <p>"My dear Sir – I have received your welcome letter, to<lb break="no"/>gether with the patterns you were kind enough to forward <lb/>Although our habits here are in many respects different from <lb/>those on your side of the Atlantic, yet, I assure, there is a <lb/>considerable degree of anxiety among our American belles for <lb/>English fasions ; and the display which your prompt atten<lb break="no"/>tion to my request has enabled me to make, has procured me <lb/>not alone a great influx of visitors, but of business. You ask <lb/>me to give you my candid opinion of the policy of removing <lb/>hither with your wife and family. I can have no hesitation in <lb/>complying with this request ; but, at the same time, I shrink <lb/>from the responsibility of your being persuade, from any <lb/>things which I may say, to follow my example. It is impossible <lb/>to disguise from myself, and I would not attempt to disguise <lb/>it from you, that many who have come here, anticipating pro<lb break="no"/>sperity and independence, have failed ; but, at the same time, <lb/>as far as my humble observation has enabled me to judge, I <lb/>am persuaded that many of those failures have been the result <lb/>of unpardonable imprudence, and the absence of that activity <lb/>and spirit of perseverance, by which persons depending on <lb/>their own exertions can alone expect to succeed. I have seen <lb/>many individuals here reduced to very melancholy straits from <lb/>having left their native shores thoughtlessly, without more <lb/>money than was sufficient to support them for a fortnight. –. <lb/>This has been dissipated, on their landing, almost before they <lb/>had recovered the effects of a long and fatiguing voyage ; and <lb/>being thus reduced to extremity, their spirits have failed, and <lb/>they have at once sunk into a state of apathy and listless de<lb break="no"/>spair. Those who have labouring and mechanic trades to <lb/>follow, and will sumbit to degradation, as some of them <lb/>call it, of becoming journeymen, do tolerably well.</p>
                <p>"With regards to myself, I need not recall to your mind the <lb/>species of drudgery to which I was forced to submit, in order <lb/>to support a decent appearance in London. You often joked <lb/>me on my enterprising disposition, and doubted my resolution <lb/>to come to this country in search of that independence which <lb/>I foresaw I could never obtain at home. Here I am, however, <lb/>and an hour since I had the pleasure of paying 30 work wo<lb break="no"/>men, the lowest of whose weekly wages, I those who <lb/>take their work home, is five dollars! You will start at this <lb/>and so will Mrs B. It is, however, no less true than extraordi<lb break="no"/>nary. In short I have every reason to be grateful to Providence <lb/>for having given me the confidence to sufficient to try an experiment <lb/>which has turned out so fortunately. I have commenced both <lb/>millinery and dress-making, to which I have added the child<lb break="no"/>bed and ready made linen business ; and in every one of <lb/>branches I am full of orders. My most sanguine hopes <lb/>have been realized. My capital at the beginning was exactly <lb/>1.60 Sterling and a few of those articles of stock which <lb/>were necessary to make a show. These, combined with the <lb/>attractive titled of " Miss P–, from London,'&amp;c. in a <lb/>few weeks set me afloat in a surprising manner. I did my <lb/>utmost to please my customers, and, in a few months, moved <lb/>from a situation of obscurity to one of the first respecta<lb break="no"/>bility. I am thus particular because I know you feel an <lb/>interest in my fate. My brother James, who you know <lb/>is a bricklayer and builder, has been equally fortunate.– <lb/>He has had several contracts, and is now building a row of <lb/>twenty houses, besides other jobs of a smaller description.</p>
                <p>"Of the other fiften persons who accompanied us from <lb/>Godalmbing and its neighbourhood I am proud to say they <lb/>have all been tolerably successful. The greater part of them, <lb/>you know, were farmers, and they are now settled in farms <lb/>of from fifty to five hundred acres, from one hundred to one <lb/>thousand miles from this place. All these, hoever, came <lb/>out with small capitals–but none with less than myself–and <lb/>husbanding their resources, and abstaining from extravagance <lb/>of every description, they finally successed in laying the <lb/>foundation of their own future happiness.</p>
                <p>We all have our own prejudices in favour of our old habits ; <lb/>but this must wear off in the course of time?other there <lb/>is a roughness and absence of what we call "good manners" <lb/>about some of the Americans, not at all congenial to English <lb/>taste. They are for the most part, however, hospitable ; <lb/>and if you let them have their way, and do not thwart their <lb/>humours, are really very kind, and disposed to friendly inter<lb break="no"/>course. You talk to carrying your family to the Western <lb/>states–to the Illinois country, and of commencing farmer <lb/>and storekeeping there. It is probably that your views may be <lb/>very correct, but I think you may settle nearer to us, if not <lb/>at so cheap a rate, at best with a greater certainty of present <lb/>comfort. Of the Western States, I, of course, can know no<lb break="no"/>thing but by report. The emigration in that direction has <lb/>been immense, but the journey to some has been so long, as <lb/>frequently to produce repentance before the destined goal was <lb/>reached. We have had several English, Scotch, and Irish fa<lb break="no"/>milies here, on the way to Pittsburgh, who, I understand, <lb/>were bound for Mr Birkbeck's settlement ; but I have not <lb/>heard of their arrival. The greater part have gone down the <lb/>Ohio in arks, which you say you have seen described in Birk<lb break="no"/> <lb/>beck's books. No doubt these people must have to encounter <lb/>great privations, and perhaps some danger ; time and perseve<lb break="no"/>rance, however,will overcome all difficulties, and from the na<lb break="no"/>tural course of things, in the end the great object in view, plenty <lb/>and independence, must be attained ; and this as you very <lb/>justly say, is "worth a struggle." Upon the whole, if you can <lb/>be content to give up all those luxuries of which an English <lb/>fireside is the scene ; to abandon the habits of social inter<lb break="no"/>course to which an English neighbourhood give encou<lb break="no"/>ragement ; and to derive happiness from the consciousness of <lb/>seeing yourself surrounded by an abundance of the necessaries <lb/>of life alone ; you cannot fail of success. I agree with you, <lb/>that a vast deal of the pleasure of England are counterbalan<lb break="no"/>ced by the castant visitation of the tax-gathered. From these, <lb/>at least you will be free here ; and as for society, your own <lb/>family, large as it is, must be a treasure in itself ; added to <lb/>which, in proportion as wealth increases, civilisation must <lb/>follow. If you could get three or four families with whom <lb/>you are acquainted, to join in your plans and settle in your <lb/>neighbourhood, an additional assuance of success and happi<lb break="no"/>ness would be attained.</p>
                <p>"As to capital, I think you ought to hav, on your land<lb break="no"/>ing here, L. 500, which, with moderate exertions and com<lb break="no"/>mon good fortune, must afford yo uthe means of certain <lb/>prosperity. I shall, however, write again in September on <lb/>this subject, when I intend sending for my sister, and per<lb break="no"/>haps the information I may be able to collect in the interim <lb/>will confirm your plans, and induce you to accompany her to <lb/>this side of the water. I rather think we shall shortly have <lb/>another cargo from Surrey ; I will let you know every parti<lb break="no"/>cular in my next, as well as send you a list of the things, <lb/>which it will be policy for you to bring with you. Your <lb/>seven children, instead of being a burden to you here, will <lb/>form one of the most prominent sources of your wealth."</p>
