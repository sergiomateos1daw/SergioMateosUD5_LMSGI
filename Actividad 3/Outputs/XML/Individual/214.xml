                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">London, Saturday,</hi>  August 15, 1829</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The King.</hi> –We are happy to learn from a private <lb/>source of unquestionable authenticity, that the King <lb/>has seldom, if ever, in his whole life, enjoyed better <lb/>health than at the present moment. From the same <lb/>quarter we have received a confirmation of what we <lb/>mentioned some time back, that according to the present <lb/>arrangements of the Court, it is certainly his Majesty's <lb/>intetion to visit Brighton before the expiration of the <lb/>year.– <hi rend="italic">Brighton Gazette.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Revenne.</hi> –Ever since the beginning of the quar<lb break="no"/>ter, symptoms of progressive improvement have mani<lb break="no"/>fested themselves in the revenue. Of late they have <lb/>assumed a more decided and promising character, and if <lb/>the seven weeks that remain prove as productive as the <lb/>first month has been, not only will thre be no falling <lb/>off at the close, but a considerable increase may confi<lb break="no"/>dently be anticipated. We understand that the general <lb/>return of duties paid at Custom-house in the port of <lb/>London, for the month o July last, amounts to one <lb/>million one hundred and ten thousand pounds. The re<lb break="no"/>turns from the out-ports have not all yet been received, <lb/>but, on a fair calculation, it is supposed that they will <lb/>amount to above one million sterling.– <hi rend="italic">Courier.</hi></p>
                <p>It is certainly true that Laurent made an offer of <lb/>L8000 a year for Covent Garden ; but when asked to <lb/>put his offer into writing, he withdrew, and nothing <lb/>more has been heard of it.– <hi rend="italic">Court Journal.</hi></p>
                <p>The new musical entertainment forthcoming at the <lb/>English Opera House, to be called <hi rend="italic">The Spring Lock, </hi><lb/>is founded upon one of the fictions of an early Italian <lb/>novelist (Lasca), the incidents of which almost include <lb/>the romatic and eventful interest of the Arabian Nights' <lb/>Entertainments. Peake is the accredited author–Keeley <lb/>is to be the hero, and Wood the principal vocalist ; G. <lb/>H. Rodwell is the composer.</p>
                <p>It is stated in a recent French paper, that during the <lb/>last eight months not fewer than twenty political and <lb/>literary journals have been started in the French pro<lb break="no"/>vinces.</p>
                <p>It is stated in a French newspaper than an inhabitant <lb/>of Lyon grafted upon the same stem red and white <lb/>grapes, and peaches, and apricots, which all flowered at <lb/>the same time, and gave ripe fruit with a few days of <lb/>each other.</p>
                <p>A carriage, containing 60 persons, was this day seen <lb/>to traverse Paris. It was drawn by six horses, merely <lb/>by way of trial. This carriage and several simi<lb break="no"/>lat ones are building in the square of St Salpier. They <lb/>are to run between Paris and Lyons.– <hi rend="italic">Paris Paper.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Steam Navigation.</hi> –Information has reached the <lb/>India House, that the East India Company's steam<lb break="no"/>vessel Enterprise will leave Bombay on the 15th of No<lb break="no"/>vember next, for Suez, where she may be expected to <lb/>arrive early in December. Another steam-vessel is to <lb/>leave Bombay for the same destination in January next. <lb/>A communication by steam between this country and <lb/>the Mediterrarean has already been opened, and might, <lb/>we suppose, be easily extended to Egpyt. The expense <lb/>of such a speculation would probably be amply com<lb break="no"/>pensated by the profit of conveying by so desirable a <lb/>route passengers to and from the East Indies.</p>
                <p>His Majesy the King of Prussia has honoured Mr <lb/>by presenting him with a splendid gold snuff<lb break="no"/>box, as a token of his Majesty's approbation of Bel<lb break="no"/>shazzar's Feast." the "Dalage."&amp;c. <cb/><hi rend="italic">Swan River.</hi> –That beautiful ship, the Gilmour, <lb/>sailed on Monday evening for the Swan River. She <lb/>has upwards of 200 passengers on board, the whole of <lb/>whom are highly respectable, and many of them are in <lb/>opulent circumstances. When Mr Peel came alongside <lb/>(accompanied by Mr Soltau), just before the ship got <lb/>under weigh, the passengers and crew gave him three <lb/>cheers, and his reception altogether was of the most <lb/>gratifying description. The property on board the <lb/>Gilmore alone amounts to the more than L60,000. We <lb/>understand also, that the Minstrel will call at this port <lb/>in about a fortnight to take out other settlers on ac<lb break="no"/>count of Mr Peel. We are informed that Government <lb/>have increased Mr Peel's grant of land from 350,000 <lb/>to 1,000,000 acres.– <hi rend="italic">Plymouth Journal.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gurney's Steam Carriage.</hi> –Yesterday afternoon Mr <lb/>Gurney's steam carriage was exhibited, at the request <lb/>of the Duke of Wellington, in the Houslow Barrack <lb/>yard, before his Grave, the Ladies Percy, Dance, and <lb/>Murray ; Lords Fitzroy Somerset, Rosslyn, and Tho<lb break="no"/>mas Cecil ; Lieut. General Sir W. Gordon, Quarter<lb break="no"/>Master General ; Sir George Murray, Sir Charles Dance, <lb/>and a large number of military and scientific gentlemen. <lb/>His Grace, Sir W. Gordon, the Ladies Percy, &amp;c. had <lb/>a carriage attacked, and rode round the yard with the <lb/>greatest pleasure and satisfaction. Afterwards a wag<lb break="no"/>gon was fastened to the steam carriage containing 27 <lb/>soldiers besides Mr Gurney and two or three men on <lb/>the engine, and though the road was very disadvanta<lb break="no"/>geous, being a rough loose sand and gravel, it drew <lb/>them round without the least diminuition of its speed, <lb/>between nine and ten miles an hour. In these experi<lb break="no"/>ments Mr Gurney applied his steam generally but to <lb/>one wheel in order to give the company full proof of <lb/>the power and practicability of the invention. Having <lb/>satisfied them as to this, and as to its manageability, <lb/>by a variety of involutions and evolutions, he gave them <lb/>a specimen of its speed, and drove seven or eight times <lb/>round at the rate of 16 or 17 miles an hour. It is <lb/>difficult to say whether the company was more pleased <lb/>or surprised at these unequivocal proofs of Mr Gurney's <lb/>success. The Duke of Wellington observed that it <lb/>was scarcely possible to calculate the benefits we should <lb/>derive from the introduction of such an invention as <lb/>this.</p>
                <p>The French papers of Tuesday state that the Em<lb break="no"/>peror Nicholas was preparing to make a new levy at the <lb/>rate of 4 upon every 500 male individuals, which would <lb/>give about 160,000 fresh soldiers. He is said, however, to <lb/>have deferred promulgating the ukase until he should <lb/>have ascertained that the Porte had definitely rejected <lb/>the terms of peace which he had proposed. On the <lb/>other hand, we are told that the Sultan has rejected those <lb/>terms, and that, notwithstanding the successes gained <lb/>by the Russians, he was resolved to run all the chances <lb/>of a desperate struggle rather than submit to conditions <lb/>which he deemed insulting.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The English Bench.</hi> –There are two vacancies at <lb/>present on the judicial Bench ;–one occasioned by the <lb/>death of Mr Baron Hullock ; the other by the more <lb/>recent decease of Mr Charles Warren, Chief Justice of <lb/>Chester, who expired at his house in Bedford Square, <lb/>on Wednesday afternoon, in the 66th year of his age. <lb/>Mr Campbell is spoken of as the successor of the for<lb break="no"/>mer ; and the choise, we supposem will be generally <lb/>deemed to be a proper one. With respect to the Chief <lb/>Justiceship of Chester, an evening paer, the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi>, very <lb/>properly recalls to public recollection the fact, that "the <lb/>Commissioners on the Common Law had recommended <lb/>in their report, the abolition of the Welsh judgeships <lb/>altogether;" and adds an opinion, in which we per<lb break="no"/>fectly coincide, tht " the present seems a fair op<lb break="no"/>portunity for carrying the recommendation into effect." <lb/>Indeed, in our mind, every opportunity is a fair one <lb/>for reducing public expences, when public burdens are <lb/>oppressive.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Platina Coin.</hi> –We have seen a specimen of the <lb/>new Russian platina coinage. The coin is about the <lb/>size of a shilling, but heavier than a sovereign, and of <lb/>three roubles value. On one side are the Russian eagle <lb/>and imperial arms; on the other the value of the coin, <lb/>and date– <hi rend="italic">Globe.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ugly Wives Fittest for Poets.</hi> –The spouses of the <lb/>living British poets are well known to be among the plain<lb break="no"/>est of the <hi rend="italic">sect</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">Mr Slinslop</hi>  would say.–is wed<lb break="no"/>ded to the head of a gorgon, – – is not much better <lb/>off, – – has eloped from his mate. We might run <lb/>through the whole catalogue, without discovering a <lb/>handsome woman, yet none have exceleed these writers <lb/>in descriptions of female beauty. The truth is, that <lb/>the contemplation of a bottle or peaked nose, a wide <lb/>mouth, goggle eyes, and a spare body, causes an author <lb/>to set out with more enthusiasm in search of the ideal <lb/>of womanly perfections, and affords the widest scope to <lb/>the imagination. Nothing impedes the fancy more <lb/>domestic intercourse with a celestial shape and di<lb break="no"/>vine face ; in which case a fatal uxoriousness supersedes <lb/>the poet's diligence, and he ceases impotently to de<lb break="no"/>scribe what he can well enjoy. Milton's Eve was not <lb/>copied from Mrs Milton grilling his dinner at the kitch<lb break="no"/>en fire–but from some unattainable damsel of his fan<lb break="no"/>cy. Plurality of women is only allowed to a poet– <lb/>one lawful, plain, household wife–and as many airy <lb/>mistresses as he can embody.</p>
