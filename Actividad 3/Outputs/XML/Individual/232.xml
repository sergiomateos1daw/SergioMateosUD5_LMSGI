                <p><pb/><hi rend="italic">The Wool Trade.</hi> â€“The whole of the London public <lb/>sales of Colonial and other woold having now been <lb/>gone through, the wool trade is in a more settled state, <lb/>and transactions by private contract are conducted on a <lb/>more extensive scale. The total amount of the late <lb/>sales, the last of which took place on Tuesday, was <lb/>4,000 bales, and the colonial wools were taken by the <lb/>manufactures at the extreme advance realized at the <lb/>previous sales in July. In some cases, indeed, quota<lb break="no"/>tions from 2d to 3d per lb. in advance were obtained. <lb/>The sales on Saturday was most fully attended, and in<lb break="no"/>creased boldness was observed. The colonial wools <lb/>offered on that day fetched excellent prices. Some few <lb/>bales were also offered, forming a part of the second <lb/>clip of wools in the new colony on the Swan River. <lb/>They were much better in quality than those last re<lb break="no"/>ceived. Some German lambs' wool also commanded <lb/>attention, and sold as high as 3s 10d to 4s per lb. The <lb/>sale on Tuesday (the last of the series,) was not quite <lb/>so fully attended as those of last wekk, but, according <lb/>to quality, full prices were obtained. The sale consisted <lb/>of 437 bales New South Wales and Van Diemen's <lb/>Land wool, 96 bales of Portugal wool, 54 Spanish, and <lb/>72 bales of Cape, German, Russian, and other wools. <lb/>The best fleece of Amsterdam offered fetched 2s 10d to <lb/>3s 2d, and seconds 2s 3d to 2s 7 1/2d per lb ; the <lb/>best Portugal 1s 2d to 1s 11d ; the best Spanish 2s 5d <lb/>to 2s 8d ; the best Cape 1s 4d to 1s 8d ; the best Van <lb/>Diemen's Land 1s 8d to 1s 10d ; and the best German <lb/>2s to 2s 3d per lb. The result of these sales is to esta<lb break="no"/>blish a much firmer market for wools of all descriptions <lb/>than previously existed. The arrivals of wool are <lb/>limited, and this week only 575 bales of German wool, <lb/>and abotu 375 bales of Neapolitan wool have been en<lb break="no"/>tered at the custom house.</p>
