                <p><pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p>A letter from Corfu, dated the 10th ult. states that <lb/>the Governor of the Ionian Islands, General Mait<lb break="no"/>land, embarked on the 8th inst. for Rome, in order to <lb/>negotitate a Concordat relative to the Romish Clergy <lb/>of the United Islands, as it appeared that Lord Guild<lb break="no"/>ford, who had been charged with the affair by the <lb/>Prince Regent, had failed in his negotiation to that <lb/>effect.</p>
                <p>Previously to the departure of the Governor, a de<lb break="no"/>putation from the Parguinotes emigrants waited upon <lb/>him, to claim the sum to be paid by Ali Pacha, for <lb/>property left in Parga, agreeably to stipulation. Ge<lb break="no"/>neral Maitland assured them he would not depart with<lb break="no"/>out adopting measures in their favour, and immediate<lb break="no"/>ly issued a proclamation, appointing a commission of <lb/>payment. Sir Frederick Adam fills the office of High <lb/>Commissioner, <hi rend="italic">ad interim</hi>, during the absence of the <lb/>Governor.</p>
                <p>Advices from Demerara are received to the 3d ult. <lb/>The following is from the Guiana Chronicle of the <lb/>24th May:–" We observe by St Vincent: papers, <lb/>which we have just received, that the Royal York Ran<lb break="no"/>gers, under the command of Colonel Smelt, had em<lb break="no"/>barked on board the Diadem and Elizabeth transports <lb/>for Canada, where the regiment is intended to be dis<lb break="no"/>banded. It is stated that each of the men will have a <lb/>certain portion of land allotted them in that province <lb/>for cultivation and their future support.</p>
                <p>We have received Newfoundland Papers to the 23d <lb/>ult by which we learn that in the Court of Session, on <lb/>the 18th idem, Capt. Redman, of the brig San Do<lb break="no"/>mingo, from Ross, was ordered to pay a fine of 10l. <lb/>each, for 20 passengers brought in that vessel over and <lb/>above the number allowed by act of Parliament; and a <lb/>further sum of 10l. for not having the regulations re<lb break="no"/>specting passengers posted up in some conspicuous part <lb/>of the vessel ; making in all a fine of 210l.</p>
                <p>We subjoin an extract from the Montreal Herald of <lb/>the 12th June, relative to Mr Gourlay, the celebrated <lb/>reformer:</p>
                <p>From the Niagara Spectator, of the 27th May, <lb/>we find the far famed champion of civil liberty, Mr <lb/>Gourlay, has again made his debut in an address to <lb/>the resident landowners of Upper Canada. This pro<lb break="no"/>duction is of the same stamp as him other lucubrations, <lb/>abounding with strong and vigorous assertions in place <lb/>of facts–a well wove sophistry to beguile the super<lb break="no"/>ficial reader ; and some of the most egregious errors in <lb/>colonial policy recommended with a speciousness well <lb/>calculated to deceive. Having so often stated out dis<lb break="no"/>sent from the political proceeding of this reformer, it <lb/>would be deemed intrusive by many of our readers to <lb/>enter into a refutation of the tenets, or an exposure of <lb/>the absurdities, contained in his address. By others <lb/>we might be supposed as exalting over a prostrate foe. <lb/>Both imputations we utterly disclaim ; while, as men <lb/>we regret that the mad career pursued by Mr Gourlay has <lb/>deprived society of the benefits which might have been <lb/>reaped from his better talents (of which he doubtless <lb/>has a share), we must, as good subjects, feel happy <lb/>that his career has been checked without any bad con<lb break="no"/>sequences to society.</p>
                <p>The following is the present distribution of the for<lb break="no"/>ces in the West Indies:– <lb/>2d Regiment (or Queen's) –Demerara. <lb/>4th Ditto–Head-quarters, Grenada, five companies; <lb/>Trinidad, three companies ; and Tobago, two com<lb break="no"/>panies. <lb/>5th Ditto–Head-quarters, Antigua, five companies ; <lb/>St. Christopher's, four companies ; Montserrat, one <lb/>company. <lb/>9th Ditto–Head-quarters, St Vincent's, five compa<lb break="no"/>nies ; Dominica, three companies ; St Lucia, two com<lb break="no"/>panies. <lb/>21st Ditto (Fusileers)–Barbadoes. <lb/>1st West India Regiment–Head-quarters, Barba<lb break="no"/>does, six companies ; St Lucia, one company ; Domi<lb break="no"/>nica, two companies ; Antigua, one company. <lb/>3rd Ditto–Head-quarters, Trinidad, five companies <lb/>till further orders. <lb/>In Jamaica are the 50th, 58th, 61st, and 92d regi<lb break="no"/>ment. <lb/>In Honduras, five companies of the 2d West India <lb/>regiment.</p>
