                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Birkbeck's Settlement</hi></p>
                <p>A small pamphlet has lately been published, consisting of letters <lb/>and extracts of letters from Mr Birkbeck, of which we have been procured <lb/>a copy. The author's object appears chiefly to have been to counter<lb break="no"/>act the misrepresentations circulated on the subject of the settlement <lb/>by Cobbett. We read Cobbett's remarks when they were first trans<lb break="no"/>mitted to this country, and certainly did not think them worthy of the <lb/>notice here bestowed upon them. His objections to the new settle<lb break="no"/>ment, helped out as they were misquotation and misconstruction, <lb/>were of very little weight, except in so far as they applied to all emi<lb break="no"/>gration whatever ; and they had really nothing to render them worth <lb/>reading, but the sarcasm and caustic humour which accompanied <lb/>them. We should, therefore, have been better pleased had Mr Birk<lb break="no"/>beck allowed this restless controversist to wallow in the mire of his own <lb/>endless contradiction, and rather given us some more details regard<lb break="no"/>ing the settlement. The Americans are every year pushing forward <lb/>into the wilderness ; but it is a new thing for a body of our country<lb break="no"/>men, when withdrawing from a society richly provided with all the <lb/>accomodations which wants of civilized life render necessary <lb/>to pass through the settled and cultivated parts of the New World <lb/>and to retire to the untrodden waste a thousand miles from the sea <lb/>Though the activity of commerce carries many of the convenienes <lb/>and even luxuries of life to this remote place, still the settlers must <lb/>find such a difference in their situation as must subject them to go ma<lb break="no"/>ny privations ; and some details, shewing how the colonists got over <lb/>their difficulties, how their various wants were supplied, and how the <lb/>feelings and habits of civilized life accommodated themselves to the <lb/>woods and the wilderness, would have been much more interesting <lb/>than a reply to Cobbett's captious objections. One of the most try<lb break="no"/>ing privations of the colony seems to be a want of wives, an evil <lb/>which happily does not affect the mother country, amidst all her other <lb/>sufferings. The evil has probably been aggravated by some of the co<lb break="no"/>lonists forgetting to take their wives with them. If matters don't <lb/>get better in this particular, we may expect to hear of some of the <lb/>adjoining American towns suffering a Sabine spoliation. A cargo <lb/>of young ladies would evidently be one of the best mercantile specu<lb break="no"/>lations ; and as our own city had surplus of ten or twelve thousand <lb/>females at the last census, we have no doubt that some of our enter<lb break="no"/>prising export traders will take the hint, and, by scouring the board<lb break="no"/>ing-schools, complete a choice assortment, adapted to the Illinois <lb/>market.</p>
                <p>The following extracts the only parts that appear to have any <lb/>general interest.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="italic">English Prairie, July</hi>  13. 1819. <lb/>"My Friends and Countrymen,â€“For your service I exhibited, in <lb/>two publications, an outline of the process of emigration, from its <lb/>commencement up to the final settlement.</p>
                <p>"My first opinion of this, the spot of our choice, and the reasoning <lb/>on which that choice was grounded, are before you ; and sufficient <lb/>time has elapsed to try those opinnions by the test of experience, by <lb/>which they are confirmed in every important particular. I showed <lb/>you my own tract through the gloomy forest into a delightful coun<lb break="no"/>try, better prepared for an abode by the hand of nature than the heavy <lb/>woods by half a century of labour. I built me a cabin, and "belayed <lb/>a road to it;" for it was my ambition to be surrounded by my old <lb/>friends and neighbours. In this, too, I am gratified ; and we are con<lb break="no"/>tented with out allotment, both as to our present state and future <lb/>prospects.</p>
                <p>"This small district, which two years ago was nearly without inha<lb break="no"/>bitants, contains a thriving population of from six to seven hundred <lb/>persons. We have been blessed with health most unusual for a new <lb/>settlement, or for any settlement of equal numbers in any country ; <lb/>and no doubt is entertained by us, or by any judicious observer, of its <lb/>salubrity. We have several wells of excellent water, and many more <lb/>are in progress. Our soil is fertile beyond my own expectation ; but <lb/>our exertions have hitherto been chiefly directed to the permanent <lb/>objects of building and fencing, of which much has already been <lb/>done. We have, however, collected a stock of hogs and cattle ; and <lb/>I think acres of corn are now growing than there are indivi<lb break="no"/> <cb/>duals in the settlement."</p>
                <p>"With regard to pecuniary success, the capitalist is commencing <lb/>his operations, or looking around him undecided as to the course he <lb/>shall pursue ; but the labourer has <hi rend="italic">made</hi>  an <hi rend="italic">establishment</hi>. It is not <lb/>with him as with the capitalist, a state of hope merely, from good <lb/>prospects, but of enjoyment, from good possessions. Numbers of <lb/>this class, and of mechanics, have already realized their little free<lb break="no"/>holds, and are building cabins for themselves. The fruits of their <lb/>labour are not squandered in dissipation and excess, because they <lb/>have highr objects ; and, considering their former depressed condi<lb break="no"/>tion, it is astonishing to me, as it is honourable to them, that they be<lb break="no"/>try no arrogance in their to independence."</p>
                <p>"In the statements I have published, I see little to correct, as far <lb/>as my observation and experience have now proceeded, excepting that, <lb/>in my view of the profits of cultivation to early settlers, I have not <lb/>made sufficient allowance in time for the innumerable delays and dis<lb break="no"/>appointments inseparable from new undertakings in a new country. <lb/>A year of preparatory and unproductive exertion should be added to <lb/>the debtor-side of the account at the outset."</p>
