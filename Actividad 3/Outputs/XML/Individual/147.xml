                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Intended Colony at the Cape of  <lb/>Good Hope</hi></p>
                <p>The following letters explains, in detail, the de<lb break="no"/>gree of co-operation which Government proposes <lb/>to afford to those persons who may wish to emi<lb break="no"/>grate from this country. It will be read with <lb/>peculiar interest, and it enables us to answer, in <lb/>the most satisfactory manner, the many inquiries <lb/>which have been addressed to us, upon the na<lb break="no"/>ture and extent of the plan of which the Chancel<lb break="no"/>lor of the Exchequer submitted an outline to <lb/>Parliament just before its prorogation.</p>
                <p>( <hi rend="smallcaps">Official Circular</hi>.</p>
                <p>"Downing Street, London, 1819. <lb/>I have to acquaint you in reply to your letter of the <lb/>–, that the following are the conditions under which <lb/>it is proposed to give encouragement to emigration to the <lb/>Cape of Good Hope.</p>
                <p>The sufferings to which many individuals have been ex<lb break="no"/>posed, who have emigrated to his Majesty's foreign pos<lb break="no"/>sessions, unconnected and unprovided with any capiral, or <lb/>even the means of support, having been very afflicting to <lb/>themselves, and equally burdensome to the colonies to <lb/>which they have proceeded, the Government have deter<lb break="no"/>mined to confine the application of the money recently <lb/>voted by address in the House of Commons, to those per<lb break="no"/>sons, who possessing the means, will engage to carry out, at <lb/>the least, ten able bodied individuals above 18 years of age, <lb/>with or without families, the Government always reserving <lb/>to itself the right of selecting from the several offers made <lb/>to them those which may prove, upon examination, to be <lb/>most eligible.</p>
                <p>In order to give some security to the Government, that <lb/>the persons undertaking to make these establishments <lb/>have the means of doing so, every person engaging to take <lb/>out the above mentioned number of persons or families <lb/>shall deposit at the rate of L.10 (to be repaid as herein<lb break="no"/>after mentioned) for every famly so taken out, provided <lb/>that the family does not consist of more than one man, <lb/>one woman, and two children under 14 years of age. All <lb/>children above the number of two will have to be paid for, <lb/>in addition to the deposit above mentioned, in the propor<lb break="no"/>tion of L.5 for every two children under 14 years of age <lb/>and L.5 for every person between the ages of 14 and 18.</p>
                <p>In consideration of this deposit, a passage shall be pro<lb break="no"/>vided at the expence of Government for the settlers, who <lb/>shall also be victualled from the time of their embarka<lb break="no"/>tion until the time of their landing in the colony.</p>
                <p>A grant of land, under the conditions hereafter speci<lb break="no"/>fied, be made to him at the rate of 100 acres for every <lb/>such person or family whom he shall so take out ; one-third <lb/>of the sum advanced to Government on the outset shall <lb/>be repaid on landing, when the victualling at the expence</p>
                <p><pb/>of Government shall cease. A further proportion of one<lb break="no"/>third shall be repaid, as soon as it shall be certified to the <lb/>Governor of the colony that the settlers under the direc<lb break="no"/>tion of the person taking them out are actually located <lb/>upon the land assigned to them ; and the remainer at <lb/>the expiration of three months from the date of their lo<lb break="no"/>cation.</p>
                <p>If any parishes in which there may be a redundancy <lb/>of population shall unite in selecting an intelligent indivi<lb break="no"/>dual to proceed to the Cape, with settlers under his direc<lb break="no"/>tion, not less in number and of the description above<lb break="no"/>mentioned, and shall advance money in the proportion <lb/>above-mentioned, the Government will grant land to such <lb/>an individual at the rate of 100 acres for every head of a fa<lb break="no"/>mily, leaving the parish at liberty to make such conditions <lb/>with the individual, or the settlers, as may be calculated <lb/>to prevent the parish becoming again chargeable with the <lb/>maintenance of such settlers, in the event of their return <lb/>to this country.</p>
                <p>But no offers of this kind will be accepted, unless it <lb/>shall be clear that the persons proposing to become settlers <lb/>shall have distinctly given their consent, and the head of <lb/>each family is not infirm or incapable of work.</p>
                <p>It is further proposed, that in any case in which one <lb/>hundred families proceed together, and apply for leave to <lb/>carry out with them a minister of their own persuasion, <lb/>Government will, upon their being actually located, as<lb break="no"/>sign a salary to the minister who they have may have <lb/>selected to accompany them, if he shall be approved by <lb/>the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>The lands will be granted at a quit rent to be fixed, <lb/>which rent, however, will be remitted for the first ten <lb/>years ; and at the expiration of three years (during which <lb/>the party and a number of families, in the proportion of <lb/>one for every 100 acres, must have resided on the estate), <lb/>the land shall be measured at the expence of Government, <lb/>and the holder shall obtain, without fee, his title thereto, <lb/>on a perpetual quit rent, not exceeding in any case L. 2 <lb/>sterling for every 100 acres ; subject, however to this <lb/>clause beyond the usual reservations"–that the land shall <lb/>become forefited to Government, in case the party shall <lb/>abandon the estate, or not bring it into cultivation within <lb/>a given number of years. I am <lb/>Your most obedient humble servant. <lb/>* The usual reservations are the right of the Crown to mines <lb/>of precious stones, of gold and silver, and to make such roads <lb/>as may be necessary for the convenience of the colony.</p>
