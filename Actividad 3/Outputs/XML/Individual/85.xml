                <p><pb/><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">THE INDIANS</hi>.</hi></p>
                <p> IT is our wish, in imitation of other newswrit<lb break="no"/>ters, to give now and then an account of such <lb/>new publications as deserve the attention of the <lb/>public; but in a paper, published only twice a <lb/>week, where so much naturally occurs under the <lb/>article of temporary news, it is but seldom we can <lb/>find room for this purpose:–when, however, a<lb break="no"/>ny ting remarkable appears in the literary world, <lb/>we never fail to notice it, although it may not be <lb/>in our power to give an extensive and critical ac<lb break="no"/>count of its excellencies. We take up the pen <lb/>with real pleasure at present to announce the pu<lb break="no"/>blication of a tragedy, intitled THE INDIANS, the <lb/>reputed offspring of a learned Professor in this U<lb break="no"/>niversity. The great applause with which this <lb/>play was received, when performed at Richmond <lb/>Theatre, has raised the expectations of those who <lb/>were not present at the performance to the high<lb break="no"/>est pitch; and we think we may take upon our<lb break="no"/>selves to assert, that upon perusing it, even their <lb/>highest expetations will not be disappointed.– <lb/>The plot of the piece is taken from a well known <lb/>story published at the end of a volum of poems, <lb/>written by the same gentleman. In the choice <lb/>of a plot, where so many dramatic writers of re<lb break="no"/>spectable talents have erred, our author is peculiar<lb break="no"/>ly happy. He ha strictly observed the advice of <lb/>Horace:</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Denique sit quid vis, simplex dumtaxat et unum</hi>.</hi></p>
                <p><pb/>It is simple, and yet it does not disgust by an <lb/>appearance of nakedness.–It is one, for the com<lb break="no"/>plaints of Maraino, and the return of Oniyo, form <lb/>a beginning; the machinations of Yerdal and <lb/>Neidan to prevent their meeting a middle; and <lb/>defeat of those arts, an end, which combin<lb break="no"/>ed wake up a compleat and connected whole. In <lb/>the delineation of character the author has, on al<lb break="no"/> <lb/>every occasion, attended to the " <hi rend="italic">quid quemque </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">decent</hi> "–there are hoever some few parts, which <lb/>the critic halts to consider, but which amidst so <lb/>many beauties, he blushes to censure–Some lines, <lb/>for instance in the character of Ononthio, do not <lb/>strike us at first as strictly natural. Is so much <lb/>humanity found inthe breast of an Inan Sachem, <lb/>as to prompt him to spare a victim, about to be <lb/>destroyed accoridng to the custom of the country; <lb/>that victim a captive of war, and not only so, but <lb/>a Briton, who has been fighting against his coun<lb break="no"/>trymen, amongst whom was his only son, whom <lb/>he bleived slain? Would he exert himself so much <lb/>in favour of a stranger and a foe, at the risk of dis<lb break="no"/>pleasing the village, and consequently of losing <lb/>his power? Or is it likely that he would have <lb/>greater influence with the superstitious crowd, <lb/>than he, who was deemed of skill to bend to his <lb/>purpose the demons that sway the fortune of <lb/>mankind?–Another question concenring O<lb break="no"/>nonthio, and we leave him. Is it consistent with <lb/>the philosophic firmness of the Sachem, so to de<lb break="no"/>spair on receiving news of his son's death, as to <lb/>declare that he should know no comfort, but to <lb/>die? or is it consistent with his humanity to leave <lb/>Maraino at such a period of distress, when she most <lb/>stood in need of his kind offices?–The first, and <lb/>best supported character in the piece is that of <lb/>Maraino. Her mind seems intended as the seat <lb/>of every amiable virtue. Her grateful reverence <lb/>of Ononthio, her unaffected piety, and her huma<lb break="no"/>nity, in interfering to save an unknown captive <lb/>from death, are pleasing<supplied>???</supplied> which give<supplied>???</supplied> <lb/>an insight into her nature. In the breast of Ma<lb break="no"/>riano every thing is subordinate to her love for <lb/>Onaiyo: this leading feature in her caracter is <lb/>properly kept in view during the course of the <lb/>piece. But even in this master-piece the author, <lb/>has, perhaps, once deviated a little from nature. <lb/>The sentiments Maraino utters during the con<lb break="no"/>versation with Sydney, in the fifth act, are rather <lb/>those of a Phiosopher and Divine, than a young <lb/>creature, the chorus of whole heart are tuned to <lb/>the sweetest strains of tenderness and love. Can <lb/>she, who had lately discovered a long lost brother, <lb/>talk so coldly in his presence; Can she, who had <lb/>so lately heard of the safety of an adored-husband, <lb/>so entirely banish his image from her mind, as to <lb/>converse on matters so indifferent? Can the gen<lb break="no"/>tle Maraino become the cold moralist?–With this <lb/>one exception, the part of which we are speaking <lb/>is finely drawn and highly interesting.–The lan<lb break="no"/>guage of the piece is every where elegant, and in <lb/>many places, where the sentiment requires it, <lb/>sublime. The author has frequently dignified his <lb/>verse by the introduction of obsolete words; this <lb/>in general produces a good effect–but there is a <lb/>danger of using them too often, and of chusing <lb/>them too ancient. it is a dangerous and difficult <lb/>talk where all is so excellent, to refer to any par<lb break="no"/>ticular passage of scene as deserving most notice: <lb/>it requires no small degree of taste and judgement. <lb/>If there is any preference to be given, it is per<lb break="no"/>haps to that scene in the 2d act, where Onaiyo <lb/>gives an account of the battle at Quebec; and <lb/>the scene in the 4th act, where Maraino is prompt<lb break="no"/>ed by Neidan to slay her brother,–who proves <lb/>his innocence by the production of her husband's <lb/>belt, the sight of which draws an elegant speech <lb/>from the enraptured fair. This scene, however, <lb/>would be improved did it conclude with some<lb break="no"/>thing more apt to the joyful moment, than the so<lb break="no"/>lemn sounds of Ononthio: a speech excellent in <lb/>itself, and containing a very fine sentiment, <lb/><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Sed nunc non erat his locus.–</hi></hi></p>
                <p>Upon the whole, the tragedy, upon which we <lb/>have, guided by impartiality, spoken so freely, is <lb/>in our opinion far superior to most of those plays <lb/>which have appeared of late years:–it is devoid <lb/>of bombast:–it is nature–and she must inevita<lb break="no"/>bly please.</p>
