                <p>SUNDAY last arrived an express in this town from the <lb/>commissioners who were sent to treat with the Indians: <lb/>he had left the commissioners on this side of Lake Erie, that <lb/>day eight days. They had been met at Niagara by Indian <lb/>commissioners, and with them had sailed in separate vessels <lb/>to the mouth of Detroit river 18 miles from Detroit, where <lb/>our commissioners were directed to remain, until an as<lb break="no"/>swer should be brought from the great council of In<lb break="no"/>dian nations assembled at the rapids of the Miami and the <lb/>Lake. On the 2d of August an answer was brought to <lb/>this effect that the only terms onw hich peace could be <lb/>made was our ceding the country on the west of the Ohio <lb/>and Allegheny rivers. The commissioners suggested the <lb/>impossibilities of doing this, as the lands had been sold by the Congress, and people had settled on them, but that the <lb/>United States would be willing to give more goods than <lb/>they had given at any other time. The Indians replied <lb/>that if the Congress would give one half these goods to the people that had settled, the would leave the land, and <lb/>remove the difficulty. Our commissioners replied that the <lb/>land they must have, and would not give it up. The In<lb break="no"/>dians said it was well, and there need no more be said. <lb/>However desired them to remain if they thought proper <lb/>until they returned to the council, and laid this before them. <lb/>On the 16th of August two Indians came and informed that the final result of their deliberations was the country <lb/>in question or war. The express is of opinion from the <lb/>language of individual Indians in private, and from other <lb/>circumstances, that the British wholly conduct their council, <lb/>and dictate their demands.</p>
                <p> By the arrival of some person from Fort Washington on <lb/>Monday last, we are informed, that the Indians still conti<lb break="no"/>ue hovering about our garrisons, and occasionally stealing <lb/>horses, that the army is in high spirits, anxiously waiting <lb/>the event of the treaty, and hoping that a campaign will <lb/>take place, as no idea of peace is entertained by any one; <lb/>that the greatest pains has been taken by the commander <lb/>in chief, in training his men in the act wood fighting, <lb/>and that from their proficiency, and the<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>imity pre<lb break="no"/>vailing throughout the whole army, success may be expec<lb break="no"/>ted should a campaign take place.</p>

                <p> A Mr. Spier was removed from his lodgings in this city <lb/>on Sunday last to Governors Island, where he died this <lb/>morning. He arrived from Philadelphia last Thursday, <lb/>was seized with Fever on Friday.–The Doctors pro<lb break="no"/>nounced it the malignant putrid fever, and the event prov <lb/>ed their opinion to be just.</p>
                <p> According to a list published of the births and deaths in <lb/>the several religious societies of Philadelphia it appears that <lb/>from August 1, 1792 to August 1, 1793, the Births a<lb break="no"/>mounted to 2511, and the Death to 1467."</p>

                <p> The stages for New-York returned to this city, with all <lb/>the passengers (mortified and fatigued.) One of the dri<lb break="no"/>vers had a very narrow escape with his life, being cruelly <lb/>fired upon at Trenton; the ball passing within a few inch<lb break="no"/>es of his head! The ladies, &amp;. have been without any re<lb break="no"/>freshment on the road, as the panic and terror with which every mind is possessed, by the writings and measures a<lb break="no"/>bove alluded to, prevented their obtaining any accommo<lb break="no"/>dations on the road– <hi rend="italic">O tell it not in Gath! declare it not in  <lb/>the streets of Askelon</hi> !

                <p><hi rend="center">Extract of a letter from Philadelphia to a gentleman in  <lb/>Baltimore, dated the 20th instant.</hi></p>
                <p>"You request I would endeavour to give you a parti <lb/>cular account of the state of the city in general and the <lb/>rise and progress of the malignant fever now raging here.</p>
                <p>"I believe it will be difficult precisely to determine its <lb/>origin; but it is generally admitted to have been imported <lb/>from Cape-Francois, in a vessel which came to a wharf be<lb break="no"/>twen Arch and Race-street, beause the infection broke <lb/>out ina house connected with that vessel, and it was after<lb break="no"/>wards traced to that vessel. The disorder overtook several <lb/>families thereabouts. But most people apprehended it to <lb/>be the general fall-fever, which acted severly on those who <lb/>had the influenza–To that there was no material danger <lb/>apprehended until the death of Peter Ashton, in Vine-street, <lb/>who after a short illness, died about one month past; af<lb break="no"/>ter which the disorder was clearly discovered to be the putrid <lb/>or yellow fever, and each person became after of his neighbours, insomuch that if any became sick they were a<lb break="no"/>voided, and many fled from the sick, leaving them in a<lb break="no"/>destitute situation, perhaps shut up in a house, and the <lb/>neighbours alarmed, merchants and housekeepers moved in<lb break="no"/>to the country, and fear was stamped on every counte<lb break="no"/>nance–infirmness possessed the hearts of the people–little business was done except packing up–engaging waggons to <lb/>move goods into the country, and searching for shelter for <lb/>their families; many families set off without having a par<lb break="no"/>ticular place to go to. Thus the country became alarm<lb break="no"/>ed. Individuals died in the country–but I cannot learn <lb/><supplied reason="copy missing">?</supplied>hat it spread there.</p>
                <p>"The overseers duty became exceedingly heavy, and <lb/>several of them were taken sick; others abandoned their <lb/>post, and the business bore very hard on the remaining few. <lb/>Finding deaths increasingly abundantly, they procured car<lb break="no"/>penters to make coarse coffins by the do<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>. The malady <lb/>still increasing in Water, Front, Race and Vine-street, <lb/>threatened desolation in those quarters. The overseers, <lb/>moved by the distresses of the helpless, took possession of <lb/>Bush-Hill mansion (it being empty) and erected a hospital, <lb/>employed some physicians and nurses; sent out some ac<lb break="no"/>comadations, and provided for interring the dead.</p>
                <p>"The overseers became inadequate to the business by <lb/>reason fo fear; few in number, and the funds exhausted; <lb/>added to this the extravagant wages of the nurses, two <lb/>and three dollars per day, most of the magistrates fled; <lb/>the house of employment and hospital shut their doors a<lb break="no"/>gainst all indigent and indisposed persons. Thus were the <lb/>people, who had been private patientes on the poor list, a<lb break="no"/>bandoned and had no sheltering place, and those who were <lb/>slightly indisposed, were sent to Bush-Hill and became vic<lb break="no"/>tims with many others.</p>
                <p>"The inhabitants were requested to meet by public <lb/>advertisement, and a committee of 40 was appointed to <lb/>take charge of the Bush-Hill hospital, and to relieve the <lb/>distressed in the city and its vicinity they became organized, Ianto693 negociated a loan in the bank, two of the number volunta<lb break="no"/>rily offered their service to see the business of Bush-Hill <lb/>properly conducted; bedsteads were procured, the house <lb/>cleaned, matrons appointed and nurses under their direc<lb break="no"/>tion; an apothecary, with medicine, &amp;c. and four physi<lb break="no"/>cians to attend once a day.</p>
                <p> The remainder of the committee attend at the State <lb/>House, receive information from the committee at Bush - <lb/>Hill, and supply their demands; receive all sheets, shirts, <lb/>&amp;c. &amp;c. at the State-House, also keep a supply of <lb/>ready made coffins to furnish as occasion required. Se<lb break="no"/>veral carts are procured for the various purposes of carry<lb break="no"/>ing out the sick whom the doctors pronounce to have the <lb/>fever, of disposing the corps,and for carrying provisions <cb/>and other necessaries to and from the hospital. THere is <lb/>also a house fitted up, and under the care of a matron, to <lb/>be for the use of those children whose parents have died <lb/>with the fever; as all their relations and neighbours are <lb/>shy of them; the governor has directed the State Treasury <lb/>to be open for their use, and they to be accountable to him <lb/>for their expenditures.–The city seems quite solitary, and <lb/>business at a stand; deaths numerous, and no parade at <lb/>the interment of any; the bells do not ring, nor is there <lb/>any invitations to the funeral of any. I think about 1000 <lb/>have died since the disorder first made its appearance, but <lb/>it cannot be ascertained with precision; and we think be<lb break="no"/>tween 15 and 20,000 removed from their habitations.</p>
                <p>"The doctors suppose the disorder a little checked by <lb/>the cool weather; how that is I know now."</p>
                <p> By a passenger, arrived from Albany this morning, we <lb/>learn that, in order to prevent the introduction of the Yel<lb break="no"/>low Fever in Albany, they have formed Committees, and <lb/>fixed a Gun-Boat at some distance from the city, where all <lb/>vessels are stopt till the Doctors examine the passengers– <lb/>And, that Colonel Hamilton and Lady were arrived, but <lb/>were denied admittance into the city, and had taken lod<lb break="no"/>gings at a Mr. M'Gown's, at Green-Bush.</p>

                <p><hi rend="center">Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadelphia, to  <lb/>the Printers of this PAper, dated September 28.</hi></p>
                <p>"The papers must have amply informed you of the me<lb break="no"/>lancholy situation of this city, for five or six weeks past. <lb/>Grave digging has been the only business carrying on; and <lb/>ndeed I may say of late Pit digging, where people are <lb/>interred indiscriminately in three tiers of coffins. From the <lb/>most accurate observations I can make upon matters, I <lb/>think I speak within bounds, when I Say eighteen hundred <lb/>persons have perished (I do not say all of the yellow fever) <lb/>since its first appearance on the 3d of August, in North <lb/>Water-street; others think a larger number–but I confess <lb/>we are a good deal in the dark on the subject at present, <lb/>and it will take some time to have accurate returns made.</p>
                <p>"People have been hitherto so panic struck, that little <lb/>has been attnded to but the means of self-preservation; <lb/>gloom and melancholy is on every persons countenance; <lb/>nothing but the yellow fever is talked of; the street are <lb/>often seen without a passenger; the wharfs are deserted, <lb/>the markets miserable and uncommonly high, and nearly <lb/>one half the citizens departed. The city is truly republi<lb break="no"/>can; pomp and distinction have in a great measure disad<lb break="no"/>peared, and bad Plato himself come among us to preach <lb/>up the practice of true republicansim, his lectures could <lb/>not have had a greater effect upon the minds of men than <lb/>the present mortality.</p>
                <p>"We make use of no other precaution for avoiding the <lb/>contagion, than not going into infected houses–keeping <lb/>our own well aired, clean, and frequently having the walls, <lb/>white-washed. considering the general terro, I have <lb/>more than once felt my pulse, to discover whether I was <lb/>really alive or not; however I now begin to hoep we may <lb/>escape, as cool weather is fast approaching, and one-street <lb/>in general healthy.</p>
                <p>"Of all things, this yellow fever is the most insidious– <lb/>its approaches are generally gradual–a person imagines <lb/>himself well when he is dying–other loss the use of rea<lb break="no"/>son entirely, and die in that situations. with those few <lb/>that recover its effects are long left. It acts like a steel<lb break="no"/>trap–when once it gets hold of a person, it does not ea<lb break="no"/>sily let him get off.</p>
