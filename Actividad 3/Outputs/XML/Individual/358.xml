                <p>By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler, and <lb/>part of the crew of the India brig Matilda, which sailed from <lb/>this Colony in August 1813, bound on a voyage to the Derwent <lb/>and Eastern Islands, and from thence to China; but was cut off <lb/>and plundered on the night of the 10th of April last, while lying <lb/>at anchor in Duff's Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah, one of the <lb/>Marquessas, on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poo<lb break="no"/>mootoo men) had previously deserted, and joining with some of <lb/>the Rooapoah natives, took the opportunity of a dark night, and <lb/>the wind blowing fresh right on the land, to cut the vessel adrift; <lb/>by which means she drove ashore through a heavy surf, and was <lb/>soon bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives <lb/>saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat, they con<lb break="no"/>curred universally in the design of putting the whole of her crew <lb/>to death; which appears to have been a constant practise among <lb/>the different natives towards one another, when their canoes hap<lb break="no"/>pen to fall upon a strange land, through stress of weather, or from <lb/>any other accident.</p>
                <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their Chief, or <lb/>King, Nooahetu, who presided at the horrible tribunal that had <lb/>devoted the unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter. He with<lb break="no"/>held his assent to the murder; but had no hesitation in permit<lb break="no"/>ting the plunder of the vessel. The crew were informed by such <lb/>expressions as they could understand, as well as by the gesticula<lb break="no"/>tions that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion, <lb/>that their lives were dependent on the issue; the good Chief <lb/>was opposed by many other Chiefs, who, though somewhat in<lb break="no"/>ferior in rank, were very far superior in number, supported by <lb/>the common usages of the island, from which the exhibition of <lb/>clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated, <lb/>with his son by his side, on a mat in his own dwelling; he had <lb/>been called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish of <lb/>the people, as it was not a hereditary right, but an elective dig<lb break="no"/>nity. His people pressed their solicitations earnestly , and at <lb/>length peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he <lb/>for a length of time opposed by the force of words, which not <lb/>seeming likely to prevail, he adopted a method which silenced <lb/>the whole in an instant, and saved the lives of Captain Fowler <lb/>and his crew. Finding that all his expostulations were defeated, <lb/>on the principle of undeviating custom, he deliberately took <lb/>up two ropes that were near him, and fixing one round the neck <lb/>of his son, and the other round his own, called to the Chief next <lb/>in command, who immediately approached him. His conference <lb/>was short and decisive–he first pointed to the cord that encircled <lb/>the neck of his son, and then to the other which he had entwined <lb/>round his own. "These strangers are doomed to death," said <lb/>he, "by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit that I, who <lb/>am their King, should live to see so vile a deed perpetrated.– <lb/>Let my child and myself be strangled before it is performed; and <lb/>then it never will be said that we sanctioned, even with our eye<lb break="no"/>sight, the destruction of these unoffending people."</p>
                <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than <lb/>produce, even in the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm <lb/>of surprise, mingled with a sentiment of admiration, in which the <lb/>untaught man may possibly excel his fellow-creature, whose con<lb break="no"/>ceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the <lb/>extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly <lb/>upon their King, whose person they adored, because that his <lb/>principles were good, and his government just and mild. They <lb/>saw the obedient Chief, to whom the order of strangulation had <lb/>been imparted, staring with horror and amazement at the change <lb/>which a few moments had produced; the mandate, which had <lb/>proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed; and, com<lb break="no"/>manded to perform the dreadful office, he proceeded to obey– <lb/>when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbear<lb break="no"/>ance. "The King! the King!" from every lip burst forth– <lb/>'What! kill the King! No, no, let all the strangers live–no <lb/>man shall kill the King!" Thus were their lives preserved, and <lb/>the vessel plundered of every thing on board her.</p>
                <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Nooaheva, <lb/>still remains, and is dry at low water. All her iron and copper <lb/>have been taken out by the natives, who have a thorough know<lb break="no"/>ledge of the use of these materials. That they are cannibals is <lb/>well ascertained. They form distinct factions, and make war <lb/>upon the ruling Chief. The rebels are denominated the Typees; <lb/>and the opposite parties are horribly sanguinary towards each.– <lb/>Six of the adverse party were killed and devoured by the re<lb break="no"/>bels while Captain Fowler was among them, and the following <lb/>detestable circumstance occurred on the occasion:–A native <lb/>man belonging to Port Anna Maria, who was not tattooed, and <lb/>in consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh, on pain <lb/>of death, impatient of the restraint, fell upon one of the murder<lb break="no"/>ed bodies, and darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a <lb/>voracious fury, exhaled the crimson moisture, which had not yet <lb/>coagulated.</p>
