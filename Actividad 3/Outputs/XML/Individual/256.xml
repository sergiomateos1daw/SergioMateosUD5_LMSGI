                <p><pb n="2"/><hi rend="smallcaps">Australian Colonies</hi>.–We have seen a print<lb break="no"/>ed circular containing extracts of a letter from Mr <lb/>John Sullivan, surgeon-superintendent of the Emi<lb break="no"/>grant ship <hi rend="italic">Canton</hi>, dated Sydney, 6th October 1835, <lb/>addressed to Edward Forster, Esq. chairman of the <lb/>Emigration Committee, London. In this letter Mr <lb/>Sullivan mentions that the female emigrants, on land<lb break="no"/>ing, were placed in spacious and commodious build<lb break="no"/>ings, adjoining the Government House, at Syd<lb break="no"/>ney, where every attention was paid to their com<lb break="no"/>fort and security from improper intrusion. The <lb/>writer further states :–" We landed in Sydney a <lb/>greater proportion of well conducted, industrious, and <lb/>virtuous young women, than were ever before landed <lb/>from any of the ships of the Emigration Committee <lb/>that came to these Colonies. Three-fourths of the <lb/>young women were engaged, and went into comfort<lb break="no"/>able situations, on the first and second days after land<lb break="no"/>ing ; and before a week all the useful and good ser<lb break="no"/>vants, viz. laundresses, cooks, servants of all work, <lb/>dairymaids, and housekeepers, were in places, many <lb/>of them in Syndey and the surroundings districts ; se<lb break="no"/>veral were taken up the country to Maitland and <lb/>Bathurst ; and as many more cooks, laundresses, dairy<lb break="no"/>maids, or farm servants as we had, could obtain places <lb/>in that time, for these are the descriptions of female <lb/>servants in demand throughout the colony. The <lb/>wages varied from t8 to t20. Some, who were not <lb/>very good servants of all work and housemaids, got <lb/>t8 to t10 ; cooks and laundresses, t12 to t16 (the <lb/>latter are much wanted) ; housemaids and needlewo<lb break="no"/>men, t10 to t12 ; housekeepers, t16 to t20. Go<lb break="no"/>vernesses also are much sought for it ; if we had had <lb/>twenty qualified they could have got situations in <lb/>respectable families and schools ; but the salaries to <lb/>this class are small, say t25 to t40. Nursery gover<lb break="no"/>nesses got t20. All the male emigrants who under<lb break="no"/>stood agriculture, or the management of stock in ge<lb break="no"/>neral, but particularly sheep, were engaged imme<lb break="no"/>diately, at salaries varying from t40 to t50, with a <lb/>house and rations for family use." We understand <lb/>that the <hi rend="italic">Canton</hi>  had a number of females from Edin<lb break="no"/>burgh and its neighbourhood, and the above informa<lb break="no"/>tion must be highly satisafactory to their relatives.</p>
