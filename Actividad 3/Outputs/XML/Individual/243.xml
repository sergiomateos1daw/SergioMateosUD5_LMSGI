                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">House of Commons.–July 28 </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">(Continued from our last.)</hi></p>
                <p>A message from the Lords announced that their Lordships <lb/>had agreed to the Amendments to the Ministers Appointment <lb/>(Scotland) bill ; to the Newspaper Postage bill ; and to the <lb/>Orkney Statute Labour bill.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Affairs of Oude</hi></p>
                <p>On the order of the day for the third reading of the Univer<lb break="no"/>sities' Admission bill being moved–</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Herriks[?]</hi>  took the occasion of calling on Government to <lb/>explain the circumstances which had occurred in certain <lb/>transactions between the Board of Controul and the East India <lb/>directors. These transactions, the hon. gentleman stated, to <lb/>be the repeated peremptory commands of the Board of Con<lb break="no"/>troul to the Directors of the East India Company to prepare <lb/>a despatch for the purpose of directing the Indian Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to compel the King of Oude, to pay certain claims made <lb/>on him on behalf of Calcutta bankers, which commands the <lb/>Court of Directors refused to obey, on the ground that the in<lb break="no"/>terference which the Board of Controul required them to ex<lb break="no"/>ercise with the King of Oude, was inconsistent with the re<lb break="no"/>lations subsisting between the British Government and the <lb/>King of Oude, and would be most mischievous in effect. On <lb/>the 31st of January the right jon. gentleman had appliedfor, <lb/>and obtained a rule to show cause why, under the act of Par<lb break="no"/>liament, a <hi rend="italic">mandamus</hi>  should not issue to compel the Court <lb/>of Directors to comply with the desire ofthe Board of Con<lb break="no"/>troul. On the 31st of January, 1834, the Court of King's <lb/>bench was prepared to give its decision upon the application <lb/>for the <hi rend="italic">mandamus</hi>, when, without any reason being assigned, <lb/>the right hon. President of the Board of Controul withdrew <lb/>his application.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">C. Grant</hi>  said that in the regret which had been express<lb break="no"/>ed respecting the possible collision between the two authorities, <lb/>he fully concurred; bu, entertaining such a sentiment, he <lb/>confessed it surprised him not a little to find his Right Hon. <lb/>Friend endeavouring to open a dispute already composed. <lb/>The right honourable gentleman then proceeded to give <lb/>a brief outline of the case, and referred to the various high <lb/>authorities connected with India, who had declared in favour <lb/>of the demand. With regard to his having withdrawn the ap<lb break="no"/>plication for the <hi rend="italic">mandamus</hi>  without explanation, he had to <lb/>say that he fully explain his opinions to the Directors, <lb/>he had re-stated them verbally to the chairman, and he did <lb/>not think himself required, under the circumstances, to re<lb break="no"/>enter into a long discussion upon the point. The effect of the <lb/>recommendation to the King of Oude was merely to urge the <lb/>claim upon his attention.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">R. Peel</hi>  said it was a perfectly novel doctrine, and in the <lb/>present state of the world most inconvenient, that the non<lb break="no"/>payment of debts due to his subjects should give the King of <lb/>England a right forcibly to intervene with foreign states, ex<lb break="no"/>cept where sanctioned by positive treaty.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Hume</hi>  contended, that on the whole, the debt was a just <lb/>one, and ought to be paid.</p>
                <p>The subject here dropped.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admission of Dissenters to the Universities.</hi></p>
                <p>On the question that this bill be read a third time,</p>
                <p>Mr T. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gladstone</hi>  rose to oppose it. It would, he said, be <lb/>useless to pass the bill, for it would of necessity be inopera<lb break="no"/>tive. If he were asked why he opposed a bill which, if pass<lb break="no"/>ed, would be inoperative, his answer was that he objected <lb/>to its principle, the admission of which was equally destruc<lb break="no"/>tive, whether it effected the object of its promoters or not. <lb/>Further, they were bound to respect corporate rights as long <lb/>as the intentions of their founders were fulfilled ; and no one <lb/>could deny that the Universities did fulfilthe intentions of <lb/>their founders." (Hear, hear.)</p>
                <p>Mr V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Smith</hi>  supported the bill, as one calculated to take <lb/>away a reproach from the Establishment, and be felt as a <lb/>compliment by the Dissenters, whose only desire was to exer<lb break="no"/>cise their vigorous intellects in the promotion of science <lb/>and literature.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Baines</hi>  said, that the original statutes showed that there <lb/>were then no tests, nor did any exist at Oxford, in either the <lb/>time of the Lollards or of Wickliff. The term University had <lb/>in it an argument for thegeneral use of these seats of learn<lb break="no"/>ing, which were meant to be universal, both as to the sub<lb break="no"/>jects taught, and the persons to whom they were communi<lb break="no"/>cated. In this sense, the term was understood and applied in <lb/>other countries, and it was an extraordinary fact, deserving <lb/>of attention, that the Universities of Oxford and of Cambridge <lb/>were the only universities that were closed to a large pro<lb break="no"/>portion of the upper classes of the people in any country in <lb/>Europe. This the Dissenters of England felt as a grievous <lb/>indignity, and they thought it unjust that Englishmen should <lb/>attempt to degrade Englishmen by excluding them from the <lb/>best seats of literature and science.</p>
                <p>Mr H. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hughes</hi>  could not accede to the measure, and there<lb break="no"/>fore moved that it be read that day six months.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Goulburn</hi>  contended that the introduction of the Dis<lb break="no"/>senters, as proposed under the present bill, would be nothing <lb/>short of the destruction of the present system of education at <lb/>the Universities. It was indisputable that at a University, re<lb break="no"/>ligion could only be taught according to some set form : <lb/>abandon that mode of tuition, and you abandon the religion <lb/>itself. (Cries of "No, no.") If they let in Dissenters, it was <lb/>perfectly obvious the intentions of the founders of those es<lb break="no"/>tablishments would be completely defeated : he therefore de<lb break="no"/>precated the measures as injurious to religon and opposed to <lb/>the best interest of the country.</p>
                <p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerstone</hi>, Sir R. <hi rend="smallcaps">Inglis</hi>, and Mr G. <hi rend="smallcaps">Wood</hi>  then <lb/>addressed the house, but amidst such discordant noises as <lb/>prevented what they said being heard. The laughing, jeer<lb break="no"/>ing, shouting, were such as has seldom been heard. In par<lb break="no"/>ticular two hon. members who entered from the smoking <lb/>room into the opposite gallery during the address of Mr <lb/>Wood, and who stretched themselves at full length on the <lb/>seats secure from the observation of the Speaker, kept up a <lb/>row of the most discreditable character. The Speaker, with <lb/>much indignation in his tone and manner, called the parties <lb/>to order.</p>
                <p>The motion for the third reading was carried, on a division, <lb/>by 164 to 25. <cb/>The Trading Companies Bill, the Arms Importation (Ire<lb break="no"/>land) Bill, and the Court of Chancery (Ireland) Bill, went <lb/>through committees.</p>
                <p>The Four Courts (Dublin) Bill, the Weights and Measures <lb/>Bill, and the Turnpike Acts Amendment Bill, were read a <lb/>third time and passed.</p>
                <p>The Almanack Stamps Repeal Bill, the Assessed Taxes <lb/>Repeal Bill, and the Militia Ballot Suspension Bill, were <lb/>brought in, and read a first time.</p>
                <p>The house was counted out at three o'clock in the morning.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tuesday, July 29.</hi></p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">John Cam Hobhouse</hi>  and General Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward Barnes</hi>, <lb/>took the oaths and their seats ; the former for Nottingham, in <lb/>the room of Lord Duncannon, raised to the Peerage ; the <lb/>latter for Sudbury, in the room of M. A. Taylor, Esq. deceased.</p>
                <p>On the motion of Mr Alderman <hi rend="smallcaps">Thompson</hi>  the Durham and <lb/>Sunderland Railway bill was read a third time and passed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Southern Australia</hi></p>
                <p>Mr S. <hi rend="smallcaps">Rice</hi>  moved the order of the day for the house <lb/>to resolve into Committee upon the Bill for the Colonization <lb/>of Southern Australia,</p>
                <p>Mr A. <hi rend="smallcaps">Baring</hi>  rose and stated various objections to the pro<lb break="no"/>ject. The hon. member contended that at this period of the <lb/>year there was not time to deliberate upon such an important <lb/>subject, and, independent of this preliminary objection, he <lb/>said he did not conceive that government ought to sanction <lb/>any such experiment without a full conviction that there was <lb/>a reasonable probability of its success. In his opinion the <lb/>experiment was founded upon bases more mistaken than any <lb/>similar one which had ever been tried. In fact, according to <lb/>the plan which had been laid down, the colony would be tied <lb/>up by mortgages in such a way, that it would not again re<lb break="no"/>vert to the Crown, so that the territory would be lost. The <lb/>result would be, that if the gentlemen who set the project on <lb/>foot were mistaken–as he was sure they had been–we would <lb/>be prevented from touching this large portion of Australia, <lb/>unless we could pay off the debt which had been contracted. <lb/>While he stated these objections to the plan, he was anxious <lb/>not to be understood to be inimical to colonization, for <lb/>he was very favourable to it. Every new opening to co<lb break="no"/>lonization he was convinced was a substantial benefit to the <lb/>poorer classes, (Hear, hear, hear.) It was not, therefore, <lb/>to the principle of colonization that he was opposed, <lb/>but he objected to this bill becaue the plan was a most <lb/>mistaken one, and would eventually shut up this large <lb/>portion of the world. One of his main objections was to the <lb/>extent to which it was proposed to carry the experiment. Let <lb/>the gentlemen take, if they like, 100 square miles, but let <lb/>them not risk the whole of a great continent. People, like <lb/>fuel, he said, could not well be carried too far ; they might <lb/>get a few thousands to go out, but they would never get the <lb/>tens of thousands to go which were required for the success of <lb/>the project. The hon. member then objected to two of the <lb/>principles which were laid down by the projectors, that land <lb/>should not be sold lower than 12s. per acre, and that no credit <lb/>should be given. He was convinced that any man acquainted <lb/>with the practical workings of the system in other colonies, <lb/>would blow up the whole plan in a moment. No man who <lb/>went out to Australia would think of taking less than two <lb/>hundred acres. Now that would cost him t120; it would <lb/>cost him t120 more to get himself and his family over; which, <lb/>with stock and other expenses, would amount to t500 or t600. <lb/>He would, therefore, ask any gentlemen in that house, whe<lb break="no"/>ther they thought any man who had t500 or t600 in this <lb/>country, would go out and set himself down on two hundred <lb/>acres in Australia. (Hear, hear.) He therefore suggested to <lb/>his right hon. friend to consent that the committee be post<lb break="no"/>poned until another session, and then have it referred to a <lb/>select committee. He concluded by moving, as an amend<lb break="no"/>ment, that the bill be committed on that day six months.</p>
                <p>Mr W. <hi rend="smallcaps">Whitmore</hi>  was thakful for the very candid manner <lb/>in which the hon. member had stated his objections to the bill. <lb/>With respect to the large extent of territory, he (Mr W.) <lb/>thought that was necessary, as it was intended to introduce a <lb/>completely new system of colonization–one very different from <lb/>any thing ever before attempted. The extent of land it was <lb/>intended to take under this act was from 500,000 to 600,000 <lb/>square miles, and it was the leading principle of the bill that <lb/>all the money arising from the sale of lands should be applied <lb/>to the purpose of sending out labourers free of expense.– <lb/>(Hear, hear, hear.) If this plan succeeded, there would be a <lb/>constant stream of emigrants going out. The land sold by the <lb/>Canada Company had been at a higher price. He had san<lb break="no"/>guine hopes that all the money it would be necessary to <lb/>borrow would be easily repaid. He most conscientously con<lb break="no"/>sidered that this bill would prove a very great benefit to the <lb/>country. It would tend exceedingly towards facilitating and <lb/>amending the conditions of the people of England and Ireland, <lb/>and therefore he hoped it would pass.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">O'Dwyer</hi>  contended that, before the house thought of <lb/>agreeing to such a bill as this, they ought to do something <lb/>towards the ameloriation of the condition of the people of <lb/>Ireland. The various reports which committees of that house <lb/>had made, showed that one-fourth of the land of that country <lb/>was untilled, but was at the same time what was called re<lb break="no"/>claimable land, and well calculated for the cultivation and <lb/>produce of grain. Let this country advance some of the sur<lb break="no"/>plus capital talked of by the hon. member towards the culti<lb break="no"/>vation of this bog land, and discontent would flee[?] from Ire<lb break="no"/>land entirely. The Irish people wanted employment, give <lb/>them that and the house would hear no more about murders, <lb/>fires, and other outrages.</p>
                <p>Mr S. <hi rend="smallcaps">Rice</hi>  in reference to the allusion made by the hon. <lb/>and learned member, begged to say that, although much of <lb/>the bog land in question belonged to private individuals, yet a <lb/>portion of it was the property of the Government, who had <lb/>been, and still were, making experiments, with a view to as<lb break="no"/>certain if the views of the Commissioners could be carried into <lb/>effect. With respect to the manner in which the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Essex had opened this question, he must confess that <lb/>he had brought with him much of usefulness and of experi<lb break="no"/>ence, and of such a character, too, as could not fail to carry <lb/>weight. The right hon. gentleman then proceeded to speak <lb/>in favour of the proposed colonization of South Australia</p>
                <p>After some farther discussion, strangers were ordered to <lb/>withdraw, and the house divided, when there appeared–For <lb/>going into committee, 72; against it 7–Majority, 65.</p>
                <p>The bill went through the committee. The report was re<lb break="no"/>ceived, and ordered to be taken into further consideration on <lb/>Thursday next.</p>
                <p>Several petitions were presented, and, at three o'clock, the <lb/>Speaker left the chair.</p>
