                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Africa.</hi> –Extract of a Letter from Capt. Colliver, <lb/>a Gentlemen belonging to the county of Cornwall, <lb/>and who is an Officer in the service of the African <lb/>Comapny:–</p>
                <p>Cape Coast Castle, April 21, 1821. <lb/>By the time you have received this, it is probable the <lb/>African Company will have ceased to exist ; we have <lb/>received orders to hold ourselves in readiness to deliver <lb/>up the Forsts and Settlements here to Government. It <lb/>is understood they are to be put on the same footing as <lb/>Sierra Leone. A list has been furnished to Govern<lb break="no"/>ment by the Company's Committee, of their Officers, <lb/>their age, length of service, the situations they fill ; <lb/>their emoluments[?], &amp;c. We have been blockaded here, <lb/>since the 10th of February, by the Ashantees[?] (an Afri<lb break="no"/>can tribe), who have commenced hostilities against us. <lb/>On the day before mentioned, our Governor received <lb/>intelligence that a black man belonging to Cape Coast, <lb/>where the people are under our protection, had been <lb/>cruelly murdered by a Chief of the Fantes[?], at a place <lb/>about six miles from Cape Coast, called Moree[?]. I was <lb/>immediately ordered to assemble all the soldiers I <lb/>could, in five minutes, and proceed to Moree to seize <lb/>the murderer. I quickly set off with four officers and <lb/>85 soliders. A little before we entered the town of <lb/>Moree, where the savages, between 2 and 3,000 in <lb/>number, were assembled, we saw the mangled remains <lb/>of their unforunate victim. The town stands near the <lb/>top of a hill, on the summit of which is an old Dutch <lb/>Fort. As soon as we entered the town, a fire was <lb/>opened upon us ; but as my orders were to seize the <lb/>murderer, if possible, without bloodshed, I did not for <lb/>some time allow the men to return the fire. However, <lb/>perceiving they were resolved to oppose us, I gave di<lb break="no"/>rections to my little party to give them a volley and <lb/>then to charge. The negroes retired as we advanced, <lb/>and in less than an hour we gained the hill, from which <lb/>our opponents fled in every firection. We demanded <lb/>the keys of the fort from the principal man belonging <lb/>to Moree ; who not being engaged in the affair had re<lb break="no"/>mained, and who immediately gave them up. In the <lb/>fort, which has a draw-bridge, we were perfectly se<lb break="no"/>cure from the attack of the negroes. The body we de<lb break="no"/>feated were Fantees, who were assembled to assist the <lb/>Ashantees in enforcing some very unjust demands <lb/>made by them on the people of Cape Coast. As soon <lb/>as the Ashantees, who reside near Cape Coast, learned <lb/>that the Governor had sent an armed force against their <lb/>friends, their drum beat to arms, and they hastened <lb/>after us ; fortunately we had defeated our opponents <lb/>before they arrived. However, they rallied the Fan<lb break="no"/>tees, and took a position about half a mile from the <lb/>town, with a determination to oppose our little party. <lb/>The Governor, apprised of our situation, assembled <lb/>all the forces he could muster, and speedily about 500 <lb/>of the Cape Coast people, headed by our officers, and <lb/>carrying the British flag, were seen approaching. The <lb/>enemy immediatel retired, and we were relieved from <lb/>our disagreeable situation, after having been from nine <lb/>in the morning till four in the afternoon exposed to a <lb/>burning sun, without refreshment. The negroes had <lb/>47 killed, and upwards of 100 wounded in this affair ; <lb/>we had one soldier killed, and four wounded. Since <lb/>the affair, we have not seen one of the Ashantees or the <lb/>Fantees here ; and a total stoppage of trade has taken <lb/>place. We have not learned how the King of Ashan<lb break="no"/>tee intends to act, nor is it safe to venture out of our <lb/>limits, except in large parties.</p>
