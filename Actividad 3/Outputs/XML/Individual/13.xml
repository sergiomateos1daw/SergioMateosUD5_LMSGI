                <p>"I have travelled through several of the States <lb/>and see no appearance of the poverty which you <lb/>hear so much boast of in Britain–every where I <lb/>meet rather with extravagance. Indeed they <lb/>procure too easily to be frugal in their out-givings. <lb/>All the manufactured goods imported from Eu<lb break="no"/>rope are from Britain, and they cannot have goods <lb/>equal in quality and price from any other place.</p>
                <p>"I think I never say so many children as are in <lb/>this country, every town, village, and farm-house, <lb/>are full of them.–The people of this country in<lb break="no"/>crease like rabbits: It is supposed they double <lb/>their numbers every fifteen years; but I should <lb/>think they do it in a shorter period.–What a <lb/>grand prospect for the sale of British goods, for <lb/>when so many hundreds of millions of acres of <lb/>land lye idle to be granted or purchased at a <lb/>small price, the people of this country never will <lb/>manufacture ; At present wages are high, and <lb/>1000 acres of land in the back settlements may <lb/>be purchased for as many <supplied reason="copy blur">pence</supplied>?."</p>
