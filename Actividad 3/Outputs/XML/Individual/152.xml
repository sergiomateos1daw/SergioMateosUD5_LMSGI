                <p><pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fire at Newfoundland</hi></p>
                <p>We are sorry to state that another most distressing <lb/>and calamitous fire has taken place at St. John's New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Captain Critchelly, of the alliance, arriv-[?] <lb/>ed at Liverpool from Carbonear, in Newfoundland, [?] <lb/>which he left on the 22d ult. states that a fire broke <lb/>out in an uninhabited house in St. John's between one <lb/>and two o'clock in the morning of the 18th of June <lb/>and that from the inflammable nature of the house[?] <lb/>and more particularly of their roofs, it spread with such <lb/>rapidity, that in the short space of three hours 170 fa-[?] <lb/>milies were burnt out, besides an immense quantity <lb/>of produce consumed in various stores and ware<lb break="no"/>houses.</p>
                <p>We learn from another account, that the fire destroy<lb break="no"/>ed the whole of the old part of the town. It broke out <lb/>near Conder and Tracy's store, and burnt all between <lb/>that and Messrs Baine, Johnson and Co.'s.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cape of Good Hope</hi></p>
                <p>At the present moment, under the prospect of emi<lb break="no"/>gration, all intelligence coming from this quarter is of <lb/>peculiar interest. The letters which reached town [?] <lb/>Tuesday, mention that the Caffres had commenced [?] <lb/>tilities anew, and that their numbers were very consi<lb break="no"/>derable.</p>
                <p>Cape Town, May 5. <lb/>The Caffres have broken out, and a very serious war <lb/>is carried on at present on the borders. It is said <lb/>that the savages are to the amount of 50,000, and a de<lb break="no"/>tachment of 6000 attacked Graham's Town on Satur<lb break="no"/>day week, about 12 o'clock in the day, but were re<lb break="no"/>pulsed, and 150 left dead on the fiel. They carried <lb/>off 500 wounded. Orders have been issued in every <lb/>district of the colony for the young boors to inrol them<lb break="no"/>selves to oppose the enemy.</p>
                <p>Cape Town, May 16. <lb/>The 13th regiment, commanded by Colonel Wil<lb break="no"/>shire have come up with the main body of Caf<lb break="no"/>fres, near Graham's Town and have defeated them with <lb/>great loss. Since then they have withdrawn from the <lb/>British territory. The 54th regiment arrived at [?] <lb/>place a few days ago from England and have since[?] <lb/>marched off for the frontiers. A large number of in<lb break="no"/>fantry have been mounted on horseback to [?] <lb/>them to pursue more effectually the savages. They are <lb/>all in excellent spirits. It is reported that our present <lb/>Governor is going home, and that another has been ap<lb break="no"/>pointed.</p>
                <p>Jamaica Papers to the 10th ultimo has reached us, <lb/>which confirms the sad accounts of the miserable fate of <lb/>the followers of the fugitive M'Gregor. It appears <lb/>that the schooner Marsha[?] had brought accounts from <lb/>San Blas[?], that M'Gregor, after his disgraceful flight <lb/>from Porto Bello, proceeded[?] in the brig Hero, for St. <lb/>Andreas, where he arrived on the 7th of May, and left <lb/>on the 12th, having suffered considerably from the ef<lb break="no"/>fects of his leap. He promulgated a story that he had <lb/>been betrayed by some of his Officers, who had [?] <lb/>Porto Bello ; but added he would soon receive rein<lb break="no"/>forcements from England, when he would retake it.</p>
                <p>The Blossom arrived on Sunday from the South A<lb break="no"/>merican station, last from Rio Janeiro, whence she <lb/>sailed on the 8th of June. She landed about two mil<lb break="no"/>lions of dollars at Rio Janeiro, from Litna[?] and brought <lb/>to England about 140,000 on merchants' account. She, <lb/>and the Andromache, Captain Shirreff, having [?] <lb/>treasure on board, passed Lord Cochrane's squadron, <lb/>in the South Seas, but his Lordship did not discover <lb/>even the slightest intention of interrupting either of the <lb/>ships. His Lordship's squadron appeared in excellent <lb/>order ; and it is but justice to his Lordship to state, <lb/>that he has not resorted to any undue or improper <lb/>means to man his ships ; but on the contrary in every <lb/>instance of complaint made to him by the mas<lb break="no"/>ters of merchant shipping, of any of their crew having <lb/>deserted to him, he ordered the men to be again in<lb break="no"/>stantly sent on board their respective ships.</p>
