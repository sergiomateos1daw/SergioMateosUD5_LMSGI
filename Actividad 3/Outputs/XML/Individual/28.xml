                <p>"It is with great concern I communicate to <lb/>you the following truly melancholy intelligence: <lb/>–About three weeks ago, Mr. Richard Cheno<lb break="no"/>weth, had six or eight men allowed him, by the <lb/>officer of the garrison at the Falls, to guard his <lb/>exposed plantation, in Bear Crab Settlement, be<lb break="no"/>low the Falls. In the evening of their arrival, <lb/>before they had taken their station as a guard, <lb/>a number of Indians rushed into Mr. Chenoweth's <lb/>house, killed two of the soldiers, and three of Mr. <lb/>Chenoweth's children, and tomahawked and scalp<lb break="no"/>ed his wife, leaving her on the floor for dead– <lb/>Mr. Chenoweth, (who had his arm broke by the <lb/>savages) with the rest of the men, made their <lb/>escape.–There was one of Mr. Chenoweth's <lb/>children sick, in a chamber, and, it is reported, <lb/>she never heard any thing of the dreadful massacre; <lb/>but, next morning, crawling down stairs, she was <lb/>inexpressibly shocked at the sight of a beloved pa<lb break="no"/>rent almost breathless–Mr. Chenoweth returned <lb/>next day to his house, and carried his wife to a <lb/>neighbouring plantation, where they are both <lb/>likely to recover, and, what is remarkable, she <lb/>wants to return to her own house.–The savages <lb/>have been very troublesome in this neighbourhood. <lb/>–A small company are gone to White River, to <lb/>extirpate 80 or 90 Indians, who, as spies have in<lb break="no"/>formed, have upwards of 300 horses, &amp;c. at that <lb/>place."</p>
