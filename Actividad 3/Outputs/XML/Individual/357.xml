                <p>By the Governor Macquarrie, are arrived Cap<lb break="no"/>tain Fowler, and part of the crew of the Indian <lb/>brig Matilda, which sailed from this colony in <lb/>August 1813, bound on a voyage to the Derwent <lb/>and Eastern Islands, and from thence to China, <lb/>but was cut off and plundered, on the night of the <lb/>10th of April last, while lying at anchor in Duff's <lb/>Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah, one of the Mar<lb break="no"/>quesas, on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the <lb/>crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted, <lb/>and joining with some of the Rooapoah natives, <lb/>took the opportunity of a dark night, and <lb/>the wind blowing fresh right on the land, <lb/>to cut the vessel adrift, by which means she <lb/>drove on shore through a heavy surf, and was <lb/>soon bilged and filled with water. When the <lb/>cannibal natives saw that it was impracticable to <lb/>get the vessel afloat, they concurred universally <lb/>in the design of putting the whole of her crew <lb/>to death; which appears to have been a constant <lb/>practise among the different natives towards one <lb/>another, when their canoes happen to fall upon <lb/>a strange shore, through stress of weather, or <lb/>from any other accident.</p>
                <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with <lb/>their chief, or king, Nooahetu, who presided at <lb/>the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfor<lb break="no"/>tunate mariners to instant slaughter. He with<lb break="no"/>held his assent to the murder; but had no hesi<lb break="no"/>tation in permitting the plunder of the vessel– <lb/>The crew were informed by such expressions as <lb/>they could understand, as well as by gesticulations <lb/>that accompanied their vehement debate on the <lb/>occasion, that their lives were dependent on the <lb/>issue; the good chief was opposed to many other <lb/>chiefs, who, though somewhat inferior in rank, <lb/>were very far superior in number, supported by <lb/>the common usages of the island, from which the <lb/>exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable <lb/>deviation. He was seated, with his son by <lb/>his side, on a mat in his own dwelling; he had been <lb/>called to the supremacy of the island by the gene<lb break="no"/>ral wish of the people, as it was not a hereditary <lb/>right, but an elective dignity. His people press<lb break="no"/>ed their solicitations earnestly, and at length <lb/>peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; <lb/>which he for a length of time opposed by the <lb/>force of words, which not seeming likely to pre<lb break="no"/>vail, he adopted a method which silenced the <lb/>whole in an instant, and saved the lives of Capt. <lb/>Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his ex<lb break="no"/>postulations were defeated, on the principle of <lb/>undeviating custom, he deliberately took up two <lb/>ropes that were near him, and fixing one round <lb/>the neck of his son, and the other round his own, <lb/>called to the chief next in command, who im<lb break="no"/>mediately approached him. His conference was <lb/>short and decisive: he first pointed to the cord <lb/>that encircled the neck of his son, and then to <lb/>the other which he had entwined around his own. <lb/>"These strangers are doomed to death," said he, <lb/>"by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit <lb/>that I, who am their King, should live to see so <lb/>vile a deed perpetrated. Let my child and my<lb break="no"/>self be strangled before it is performed and then <lb/>it never will be said that we sanctioned, even <lb/>with our eye-sight, the destruction of these un<lb break="no"/>offending people."</p>
                <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not <lb/>do less than produce, even in the mind of the <lb/>unenlightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise, <lb/>mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which <lb/>the untaught man may possibly excel his fellow - <lb/>creature, whose conceptions are moulded by te<lb break="no"/>nets calculated to guard him from the extremes <lb/>of passion. For a moment the people looked <lb/>wildly upon their king, whose person they ador<lb break="no"/>ed, because that his principles were good, and <lb/>his government just and mild. They saw <lb/>the obedient chief, to whom the order of <lb/>strangulation had been imparted, staring with <lb/>horror and amazement at the change which a <lb/>few moments had produced; The mandate which <lb/>had proceeded from the King's own lips must be <lb/>obeyed; and, commanded to perform the dread<lb break="no"/>ful office, he proceeded to obey when a sudden <lb/>shout from the multitude awed him to forbear<lb break="no"/>ance. "The King! the King!" from every lip <lb/>burst forth–'What! kill the King! No, no, let <lb/>all the strangers live–no man shall kill the <lb/>King!" Thus were their lives preserved, and <lb/>the vessel plundered of every thing on board <lb/>her.</p>
                <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt <lb/>at Noorheva, still remains, and is dry at low <lb/>water. All her iron and copper have been taken <lb/>out by the natives, who have a thorough know<lb break="no"/> <cb/>ledge of the use of these materials. That they <lb/>are cannibals is well ascertained. They form <lb/>distinct factions, and make war upon the ruling <lb/>chief. The rebels are denominated the typees; <lb/>and the opposite parties are horribly sanguinary <lb/>towards each other. Six of the adverse party were <lb/>killed and devoured by the rebels while Captain <lb/>Fowler was among them, and the following de<lb break="no"/> <lb/>testable circumstance occurred on the occasion: <lb/>A native man belonging to Port Anna Maria, <lb/>who was not tattooed, and in consequence pro<lb break="no"/>hibited from the eating of human flesh, on pain <lb/>of death, impatient of the restraint, fell upon one <lb/>of the murdered bodies, and darting his teeth <lb/>into it in all the madness of a voracious fury, <lb/>exhaled the crimson moisture, which had not yet <lb/>coagulated.</p>
                <p>The chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very <lb/>friendly to Europeans, is named Ke-atta-nooe, <lb/>the first part of the name implying the outrigger <lb/>of a canoe, and the latter signifying great. The <lb/>dress of the men consists merely of a wrapper <lb/>about the waist; the women are covered from the <lb/>shoulders downwards to the ancles, and are ge<lb break="no"/>nerally fairer than the Taheitan women. The <lb/>chiefs have no distinguishing mark or ornament, <lb/>but in the mode of wearing their hair; which the <lb/>common orders wear tied up in a large knot on <lb/>each side of the head, a stripe of which, extend<lb break="no"/>ing from the forehead to the hollow of the neck, is <lb/>kept shorn, which practice the chiefs do not adopt. <lb/>Captain Fowler supposes the worms to be more pre<lb break="no"/>valent and destructive to the ship's bottoms there than <lb/>he has any where else witnessed; and to this cause at<lb break="no"/>tributes the caution of the natives in drawing up <lb/>their largest canoes, some of which contain from <lb/>80 to 100 warriors. They are anxious after eve<lb break="no"/>ry kind of property carried among them for bar<lb break="no"/>ter, and this is supposed their chief inducement <lb/>for attacking vessels, when they can do so with <lb/>a probability of accomplishing their object.– <lb/>They have no knowledge of the use of muskets, <lb/>and have none among them except a few at Port <lb/>Anna Maria. A gentleman, at this time in Syd<lb break="no"/>ney, who resided among them about fifteen <lb/>years ago in a Missionary capacity, describes <lb/>them as a people constantly employing their <lb/>thoughts on plunder, and devising schemes for <lb/>taking advantage of strangers. Their population <lb/>is very numerous; which he remarked to some of <lb/>them, to whom he gave a description of Ota<lb break="no"/>heite, observing at the same time, that its in<lb break="no"/> <lb/>habitants were less numerous:–" Can't we go <lb/>and take them?- What is there to hinder us?" was <lb/>immediately demanded. This anecdote we no<lb break="no"/>tice as a specimen of their natural inclination to <lb/>hostility, in which, all accounts respecting them <lb/>correspond.</p>
