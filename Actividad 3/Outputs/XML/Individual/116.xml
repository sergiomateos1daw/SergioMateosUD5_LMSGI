                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Canada Papers</hi></p>
                <p>Montreal, Oct. 29 <lb/>The express from Upper Canada, which arrived <lb/>yesterday morning, confirmed the highly satisfactory <lb/>reports of the preceding day, that the enemy had <lb/>precipitately retreated on the 19th instant, from be<lb break="no"/>fore Chippawa, after destroying a quantity of provi<lb break="no"/>sions and heavy baggage ; and that, on the 21st, they <lb/>had passed over to Buffaloe a great part of their <lb/>force, and were blowing up the works at Fort Erie.</p>
                <p>Further accounts from Kingston have been receiv<lb break="no"/>ed this morning to the 26th instant, when the official <lb/>report of the enemy's retreat from Fort Erie, after the <lb/>destruction of the works, had not reached that place, <lb/>but there was no doubt of the fact.</p>
                <p>Major-Genera de Watteville commanded the corps <lb/>pressing on the enemy ; the master of a mail which <lb/>arrived at Kingston on the 25th, in twenty-four hours <lb/>from Fort George, further confirms the previous <lb/>intelligence, and reports that several hundred prisoners <lb/>were taken, before the Americans effected their <lb/>escape across the river.</p>
                <p>On the 18th the British came up with his rear <lb/>guard, and in a sharp action thirty of the Americans <lb/>were left on the field wihtout a casualty happening <lb/>on our side. This was at Chippawa Creek.– <lb/>The enemy then fled with the utmost precipitation <lb/>to Fort Erie, and began the destruction of his for<lb break="no"/>tifications.</p>
                <p>A military courier from Kingston arrived this <lb/>morning, brings no additional news of importance.– <lb/>Sir James Yeo had returned to Kingston with the <lb/>sick of the army of Niagara on board. We again <lb/>sailed for the head of the Lake.</p>
                <p>A private letter from Niagara of the 10th instant, <lb/>says that a severe action took place the day before <lb/>near Chippawa ; our loss is stated at 10 killed and <lb/>wounded. That of the enemy is supposed to be <lb/>very considerable ; a field piece made to bear upon <lb/>one of his columns did great execution. Another <lb/>letter denies any loss in killed but makes the wound<lb break="no"/>ed 25 or 30.</p>
                <p>Montreal, Nov. 5. <lb/>From Upper Canada we have received nothing of <lb/>importance. The report of the whole American <lb/>armies have crossed the Niagara was a mistake as <lb/>the last accounts from that quarter mention that Ge<lb break="no"/>neral Brown was still in possession of Fort Erie.</p>
                <p>Quebec, Nov. 3. <lb/>We are in expectation of some further details of <lb/>the operations on the Niagara frontier by this day's <lb/>Montreal post ; but they had no arrived at one <lb/>o'clock.</p>
                <p>The evacuation by the enemy of our territory on <lb/>that frontier is a striking illustration of the impor<lb break="no"/>tance of the command of the lake. The enemy did <lb/>cross over to our side till the moment his fleet <lb/>was ready to assume the superiority. The re-appear<lb break="no"/>ance of our fleet effected what could not be done by <lb/>the expence of so much blood and treasure.</p>
                <p>(From the Quebec Gazette) <lb/>The American Government has published the pa<lb break="no"/> <lb/>pers relating to the late negotations at Ghent. We <lb/>confess that we have seen these papers with feelings <lb/>of some satisfaction and much regret ; satisfaction <lb/>that we can now say that the honour of the British <lb/>Government is pledged to do something for Bri<lb break="no"/>tish interests in North American, and regret that that <lb/>something is so little.</p>
                <p>The Indians are to be made independent of both <lb/>nations. This is perfectly just, and would, under <lb/>certain cirumstances greatly add to the security of <lb/>these provinces. The Lakes are to be exclusively <lb/>British. On these subjects we must be permitted to <lb/>ask how long they would be permitted to remain <lb/>so, how long the Indians would retain their inde<lb break="no"/>pendence in the event of another war, if the commu<lb break="no"/>nication with them should be in the power of the <lb/>enemy ? The sole communication for military pur<lb break="no"/>poses, with the Indians and the Lakes, is by the river <lb/>St Lawrence, from Montreal to Kingston, and from <lb/>Niagara to Fort Erie ; and the Americans are to be <lb/>permitted to remain in possession of one of its banks ! <lb/>The enemy has hitherto been prevented from inter<lb break="no"/>rupting this communication by the thinness of the <lb/>settlements of their side, the consequent badness of <lb/>the roads, and difficulty of supplying a large force. <lb/>The possession of th southern bank of the St Law<lb break="no"/>rence between Montreal and Kingson, and the power <lb/>of supplying themselves, and operating on that fron<lb break="no"/>tier, by the roads now existing, and from Lake <lb/>Champlain, has been worth a large force to them, <lb/>during the whole of the war ; it has caused us to <lb/>parcel our force to support the line of communication <lb/>between Lake St Francis and Kingston, and keep a <lb/>great proportion of it to protect the base of that line <lb/>in the vicinity of Montreal.</p>
                <p>The position of Canada, relative to the United <lb/>States, with its present boundaries, is an extraordi<lb break="no"/>nary one ; so much so, that intelligent military men <lb/>have pronounced it incapable of defence much beyond <lb/>Quebec. The miserable state of the enemy's prepa<lb break="no"/>rations, the superiority which we then had on the <lb/>Lakes, the good disposition of the inhabitants, and <lb/>the prudent conduct of the commander of the forces, <lb/>alone saved it. The waste of means in protecting <lb/>and conveying supplies by a communication of five</p>
                <p><pb/>hundred miles, adjoining the whole way to the ene<lb break="no"/>my's frontie, is conceivable only to those whom ex<lb break="no"/>perience has made acquainted with the fact, or who <lb/>are habituated to reflection ; and whenever the com<lb break="no"/>munication of the Lakes becomes interrupted, the <lb/>supply of any force further advanced on the line be<lb break="no"/>comes utterly impracticable. The enemy derives <lb/>his supplies either by the Lakes, upon which an army <lb/>can effect nothing, or from a settled country, a long <lb/>way in his rear, protected by his army, a country co<lb break="no"/>vered with woods, and a militia more effective than <lb/>the best troops in such a country, always ready for <lb/>the protection of their property and their houses– <lb/>Under such circumstances, the weakness of an army <lb/>beyond a certain point is to be counted by its num<lb break="no"/>bers.</p>
                <p>We scruple not to say, that, whenever that part <lb/>of the State of New York extending to the St Law<lb break="no"/>rence, between Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain, <lb/>shall be fully settled, the whole of Upper Canada <lb/>must fall to the United States, the Lower Canada <lb/>will not be defensible but at an expence of means <lb/>far beyond its value. We had much rather see the <lb/>Americans confirmed in the possession of Sackett's <lb/>Harbour, Presqu-ile, Detroit and Michilimackinac, <lb/>than in the possession of the tract of country just <lb/>mentioned. Great Britain will always have the <lb/>means of establishing a superiority on the Lakes, <lb/>whenever she chuses to exert them, but she never <lb/>will be able to drive the Americans out of that fron<lb break="no"/>tier, when once fully settled, supported as they will <lb/>be by the immense population of the back parts of <lb/>the State of New York and adjoining States.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">From the United States Papers </hi><lb/>Urbanna, Sept. 25. <lb/>An express has arrived from Detroit, to General <lb/>M'Arthur, in six days, in which Governor Cass <lb/>says–" A state of things has arrived, in which <lb/>your presence, with the force at your disposal, is <lb/>essential to the security and preservation of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. The Indians have recommenced hostilities on <lb/>every side of us ; they are murdering the people, and <lb/>breaking up the settlements. There is now a large <lb/>force of them in the immediate vicinity of this place, <lb/>most probably within a mile of it, with the avowed <lb/>purpose of attacking the town. We have no force <lb/>adequate to the defence of the country, and none of <lb/>description proper for the pursuit of the Indians– <lb/>My opinion is, that you should hasten on with the <lb/>mounted men with all possible expedition."</p>
                <p>The express came by water, the land communia<lb break="no"/>tion being entirely cut off.</p>
                <p>Albany, Oct. 25. <lb/>The Legislature of this State adjourned yesterday, <lb/>after a session of four weeks. The principal laws <lb/>passed are:</p>
                <p>An act to authorise the raising of troops for the defence of <lb/>this State. <lb/>An act to encourage privateering. <lb/>An act to authorise the raising of a corps of sea fencibles. <lb/>An act to provide for the repayment of certain sums of <lb/>money advanced by the Corporation of the city of New <lb/>York, for the defence of the State, and for other purposes. <lb/>An act to prevent the apprehension of British deserters. <lb/>An act to authorise the raising of two regiments of men of <lb/>colour. <lb/>An act authorising additional pay to be made to the volun<lb break="no"/>teers, and for paying the militia called into service by the <lb/>State authority. <lb/>An act to aid in the apprehension of deserters from the ar<lb break="no"/>my and navy of the United States.</p>
                <p>The first act authorises the Governor to call into <lb/>actual service 12,000 men, for the term of two years, <lb/>provided the Government of the United States shall <lb/>have declared their intention to pay, clothe and sub<lb break="no"/>sist them at their expence.</p>
                <p>The privateer bill authorises associations to incor<lb break="no"/>porate themselves for the purpose of fitting out pri<lb break="no"/>vateers.</p>
                <p>The following resolution, introduced by Mr Mo<lb break="no"/>nell, passed both Houses of our Legislature unani<lb break="no"/>mously on Saturday:–</p>
                <p>Resolved unanimously–That the House of Assembly of <lb/>the State of New York view, with mingled emotions of sur<lb break="no"/>prise and indignation, the extravagant and disgraceful terms <lb/>proposed by the British Commissioners at Ghent–that, how<lb break="no"/>ever ardently they may desire the restoration of peace to their <lb/>country, they can never consent to receive it at the sacrifice <lb/>of national honour and dignity–that they therefore strongly <lb/>recommend to the National Legislature the adoption of the <lb/>vigorous and efficacious measures in the prosecution of <lb/>the war, as the best means of the bringing the contest to an ho<lb break="no"/>nourable termination, and of transmitting unimpaired to their <lb/>posterity their rights, liberty, and independence.</p>
                <p>The following is a private letter which was brought <lb/>by the Liffey :</p>
                <p>Montreal, Nov. 5. 1814. <lb/>"Sir George Prevost reached Kingston on the <lb/>10th October, where his presence has been of the ut<lb break="no"/>most importance. Chauncey resigned his blockade <lb/>of that place on the 8th, and retired with his squad<lb break="no"/>ron to Sackett's Harbour. Our fleet which was <lb/>ready for the Lake in a few days after Sir George's <lb/>arrival, sailed for Niagara on the 16th, with 500 of <lb/>the 90th, and a supply of provisions and stores for <lb/>the right division, and arrived off Fort George on the <lb/>evening of the 18th. Having landed this reinforce<lb break="no"/> <lb/>ment, Sir James returned to Kingston on the 24th.</p>
                <p>"The enemy at Fort Erie having been joined by <lb/>General Izard's army, making a force of 7 or 8000 <lb/>men, advanced upon General Drummond, and at<lb break="no"/>tacked our positions upon the Chippawa on the 15th <lb/>instant ; but having met with an opposition unexpect<lb break="no"/>ed by them, and making no impression, retired on <lb/>the 16th and 17th to Black Creek, from whence they <lb/>advanced one of Izard's brigades, 1500 men, on the <lb/>19th, with a view of our turning our right, and attempt<lb break="no"/>ed to cross the Chippawa, about six miles from its <lb/>mouth, where they were met with by a corps of about <lb/>1000 troops, under Colonel Meyers, who faced them <lb/>most manfully ; they skirmished the whole day, in <lb/>which the Glengarries supported their high charac<lb break="no"/>ter, and, in the evening, <hi rend="italic">Jonathan</hi>  finding himself <lb/>foiled, and unable to bring up his artillery from the <lb/>horrid state of the roads, retired again to the main <lb/>body at Black Creek.</p>
                <p>"Our casualties on this occasion were triflin– <lb/>those of the enemy were said to have been considerable, <lb/>though he refrained from exposing himself to our <lb/>fire in the open ground. We had two field-pieces <lb/>there, and whenever the enemy showed a column <lb/>out of the wood, a well-directed discharge soon o<lb break="no"/>bliged them to return to their shelter. By this time <lb/>our fleet being announced, gave alarm to the enemy, <lb/>and they commenced a precipitate retreat to Fort <lb/>Erie.</p>
                <p>"They were purused on the 20th and 21st by <lb/>our advance, under Major-General Watteville, close <lb/>to Fort Erie, where he found them occupying the <lb/>high ground, which General Drummond had not <lb/>left many weeks before, and could push no further. <lb/>At the date of the last accounts from General Drum<lb break="no"/>mond, Jonathan still maintained his post, from which <lb/>it will require a few columns of fresh troops to dis<lb break="no"/>lodge him, but as they are now on their way to join <lb/>the right dividion, I trust I shall in a short time have <lb/>the pleasure to acquaint you of the complete expul<lb break="no"/>sion of the enemy from the Niagara frontier. It is <lb/>said, that for want of sufficient shelter, a part of Ge<lb break="no"/>neral Izard's force had crossed to Buffalo, and that <lb/>they had passed over some heavy artillery and stores, <lb/>leaving at the fort such a force as they conceived ca<lb break="no"/>pable of defending it.</p>
                <p>"Sir James brough down with him the skeleton <lb/>of the 1st battalion of the King's regiment, and the</p>
                <p><pb/>remains of the two flank companies of the 10th. He <lb/>sailed again on the 1st inst. taking with him about 1200 <lb/>men, comprising the 37th, a brigade of artillery, a 9<lb break="no"/>pounder, and detachments from the 6th and 82d re<lb break="no"/>giments, and a large supply of provisions and stores. <lb/>The five hundred of the 9th regiment who marched to <lb/>York would be crossed to Niagara in the brigs ; the 9th, <lb/>850 strong, were to have been embarked in the fleet, <lb/>but Sir James could not take them. The Royals, 41st, <lb/>89th, and 100th, exhausted corps, return to Kingston by <lb/>this trip of the fleet, which I fear was scarcely able to <lb/>make another this season. The St Lawrence has proved <lb/>a noble ship, and one and all seem delighted with her. <lb/>The frigate in frame arrived at Kingston, where she <lb/>has been laid down and lengthened to make her the <lb/>size of the Prince Regent. The keel of a 74 is also laid <lb/>down there. The Americans are said to have com<lb break="no"/>menced upon two more ships of the class of the Su<lb break="no"/>perior. Letters from Michilimacinack to the 19th <lb/>October state, that the capture of the two schooners <lb/>will be attended with the most important benefits in <lb/>the security of that post, and the territory dependent <lb/>upon it. Captain Rocheblave, with the detachment <lb/>of the 81st under Capt. Wardrop, and artillery, ar<lb break="no"/>rived there on the 14th October, without any cas<lb break="no"/>ualty among the troops ; and Mr M'Kenzie, with his <lb/>brigade, would arrive about the 21st. The two <lb/>schooners had made a trip to Nottawasage for provi<lb break="no"/>sions and supplies, and would attempt another before <lb/>the navigation closed. A reinforcement had been <lb/>sent under Capt Bulgar to Praire du Chain.</p>
                <p>"The arrangements necessary for reinforcing and <lb/>supplying General Drummond's army being com<lb break="no"/>pleted, and the attack upon Sackett's Harbour being <lb/>deemed impracticable this season, Sir George return<lb break="no"/>ed last evening to this place ; his journey to King<lb break="no"/>ston has certainly had the effect of inducing Ge<lb break="no"/>neral Brown, with a considerable part of his force, <lb/>to move to Sackett's Harbour, and has thus left <lb/>General Izard so much weakened at Fort Erie, that <lb/>I have little doubt of the result of an attack upon <lb/>him.</p>
                <p>"I am sorry to see that the malice of a certain party <lb/>here has been at work at your side of the water ; it <lb/>has increased tenfold since the expression of the <lb/>public sentiment in favour of his Excellency, by the <lb/>addresses which are now preparing, and which I <lb/>can assure you is the real and unsolicited voice <lb/>of the people. I am happy to find that General <lb/>Kempt is going to England, as he will afford true <lb/>information upon the state of the country, and be <lb/>able to exposethe falsehoods which have been circu<lb break="no"/>lated respecting recent events."</p>
