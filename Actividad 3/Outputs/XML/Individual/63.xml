                <p><hi rend="italic">November</hi>  12. On Thursday last the Viscount de <lb/>Ponteves gave a surperb entertainment and ball to <lb/>a number of respectable ladies of gentleman of <lb/>this town on board l'Illustre, of seventy-four guns. <lb/>The boats of the fleet, the state yacht and barge, <lb/>received the company at Foster's wharf, before <lb/>12 o'clock–and on the appearance of the first <lb/>boat having ladies on board, a signal gun was fir<lb break="no"/>ed from l'Illustre, and in an instant the squadron <lb/>was beautifully arrayed with the flags of all na<lb break="no"/>tions. On arriving at the ship, the company <lb/>were very politely received by the Viscount, and <lb/>conducted to the state room–the marines saluting <lb/>as the company passed them. At one o'clock <lb/>the whole sat down to a table liberally spread with <lb/>a profusion of luxuries and delicacies, in a hall e<lb break="no"/>rected for the occasion, which was very fancifully <lb/>decorated. At the head of the table was a castle <lb/>of pastry, having thirteen metal guns, by which <lb/>from tubes that communicated through the table, <lb/>and the company were saluted with a f–deral dis<lb break="no"/> <lb/>charge. On the top of the castle waved a small <lb/>white ensign–the device, <hi rend="italic">two hearts</hi> –the motto, <lb/>" <hi rend="italic">The United hearts of America and France</hi>." <lb/>The head of the hall was ornamented with a <hi rend="italic">heart </hi><lb/>pieced with arrows–and in the motton, " <hi rend="italic">Ho<lb break="no"/>mage to the fair daughters of America</hi>," a fine com<lb break="no"/>pliment made by the noble Viscount to his fe<lb break="no"/>male guests. After dinner, the ball began, and <lb/>closed before nine o'clock, and on departure, his <lb/>Excellency was saluted with thirteen rockets let <lb/>off from a boat moored at some distance from the <lb/>ship.</p>
                <p>Rhode Island and North Carolina yet remain a<lb break="no"/>verse to the new government; they refuse alle<lb break="no"/>giance to all acts of the States, and, of course, do <lb/>not participate in any privilee; they are treated <lb/>in respect to port entries, &amp;c. as foreign States.</p>
