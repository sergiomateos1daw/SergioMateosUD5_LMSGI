                <p>"By Captain Gilbert, the bearer of this <lb/>you will learn our distress for want of provi - <lb/>sions: There has not been in the whole island <lb/>one bushel of corn for sale for 16 days past. <lb/>Capt. George, from Baltimore, brought in <supplied reason="copy missing">???</supplied><lb/>days ago two bushels of corn, which sold immed<lb break="no"/>diately at 6s. 8d. per bushel; he also brought in <lb/>360 barrels of flour, common and superfine, which <lb/>sold at eight and nine dollars per barrel. No ves<lb break="no"/>sel has arrived here with provisions since Capt. <lb/>George; and no vessel belonging to the island is <lb/>expected to relieve us. A great number of poor <lb/>people have been for ten days past obliged to live <lb/>on the greens of the field. Governor Hamilton, <lb/>by advice of his counsel, has opened the port of <lb/>Bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever, for thirty <lb/>days, to be computed from the 30th day of March, <lb/>laden with bread, corn; or flour. He also allows, <lb/>for three months, the importation of salted pro<lb break="no"/>visions from any foreign port whatever, in vessels <lb/>belonging to these islands. IT is said, what if any <lb/>foreign vessel should come here after the time per<lb break="no"/>mited by proclamation, they will be allowed to <lb/>dispose of their cargo, if they can prove they set <lb/>out with an intent to come here. If any vessels <lb/>be ready to sail from Norfolk, with provisions, ad<lb break="no"/>vise them to call at Bermuda."</p>
