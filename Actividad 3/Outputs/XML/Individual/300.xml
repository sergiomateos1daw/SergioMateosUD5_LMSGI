                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to New Zealand.</hi> –On Friday the <lb/>Tyne left the London Dock, and proceeded down the <lb/>river on her voyage to Port Nicholson, New Zealand. <lb/>The Tyne is a fine new vessel, and she takes out 50 <lb/>mechanics and labourers, with their families, from the <lb/>Emigration Depot at Deptford, besides a number of <lb/>other passengers, amongst whom are Mr Swainson, <lb/>Chief Justice, and Mr Martin, Attorney-General, of <lb/>the new colony, to which sations they have been re<lb break="no"/>cently appointed. The arrangements for the comfort <lb/>of the emigrants on board were certainly very com<lb break="no"/>plete ; and it must be gratifying to know that those <lb/>persons sent out by the company will be provided <lb/>with a large proportion of their provisions fresh, a <lb/>great quantity of patent preserved provisions being <lb/>shipped for that purpose on board the Tyne. There <lb/>are a greater number of children than usual in the <lb/>Emigration Depot–many of the families consisting of <lb/>from eight to twelve individuals. The Prince Rupert, <lb/>which now lies in the London Dock, will clear out on <lb/>the 10th inst ; and it is supposed she will pretty well <lb/>clear the depot of its present inmates.</p>
