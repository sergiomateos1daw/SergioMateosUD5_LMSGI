                <p><pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p>In our last paper, we gave, from the Jamaiza Ga<lb break="no"/>zettes, an account of the dreadful drought which had <lb/>prevailed in that island for more than twelve months <lb/>and the consequences of which had been most calami<lb break="no"/>tous. We are now, however, most happy, in being <lb/>able to state, upon the authority of a Gentleman who <lb/>left Jamaica some days subsequently to the date of our <lb/>preceding advices, that this terible evil, in such a cli<lb break="no"/>mate particularly, had at length ceased. The follow<lb break="no"/>ing is the substance of the information which has been <lb/>communicated to us:–</p>
                <p>"A few hours previous to my going on board the <lb/>Jamaica packet, on the 3d of September, the rain fell <lb/>in such torrents as to flood the streets of Kingston to <lb/>the depth of two feet, and it seemed to be general <lb/>throughout the district of Liguanea.</p>
                <p>"Though too late to save the crop of sugar for the <lb/>present, or, perhaps, the ensuing year, this seasonable <lb/>change of weather would at least have the effect of <lb/>staying the mortality among the cattle. As such, those <lb/>interested in the island will receive the intelligence <lb/>with gratification. On some properties, the canes had <lb/>been cut as fodder to save the stock."</p>
                <p>We have the Cape of Good Hope papers to the 6th Au<lb break="no"/>gust, and as they are unusually barren in their con<lb break="no"/>tents, it is fair to infer that every thing was proceeding <lb/>there in a satisfactory manner. The only article of <lb/>the slightest interest relates to the change the Governor <lb/>is gradually effecting in the currency, by removing <lb/>from it all the base metal, and substituting gold and <lb/>silver of standard value.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gazette of Dordrecht</hi>  publishes accounts from <lb/>Java to the 29th May. They confirm the statement of <lb/>the decrease of the malady, and mention, that it was <lb/>almost wholly subdued in the district of Samarang, <lb/>but that 18,000 persons, mostly Europeans, had fal<lb break="no"/>len victims. Batavia and Sourabaya were still in<lb break="no"/>fected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">India</hi> –Extract of a letter from Calcutta, dated <lb/>June 20:–</p>
                <p>"If the extension of foreign trading be considered with <lb/>you as a means suited to alleviate the pressure, and ease <lb/>the difficulties of Old England, which we read of here, <lb/>we imagine that India can furnish beneficial openings to <lb/>this kind of remedy. The use of articles of British pro<lb break="no"/>duction and exports is gaining ground rapidly here ; the <lb/>English printed cottons are now carried in considerable <lb/>quantities as far as Rajpootha, and find a ready sale, if <lb/>they be of handsome patterns. The warehouses now are <lb/>so far from being overstocked, that before the arrival of <lb/>two vessels from England in the last fortnight, all Euro<lb break="no"/>pean articles were exorbitantly high ; mustard flour sold <lb/>about 20s. a pound ; cheese 1[?] ; ham, three half crowns <lb/>the ld ; a common round hat, three guineas. These, <lb/>undoubtedly, were prices arising from an unusual scarci<lb break="no"/>ty ; but it surely cannot be so very bad a trading, <lb/>which admits, even, indicidentally, of such an exaggera<lb break="no"/>tion of price and profit. Government bonds are now at <lb/>six per cent premium, though they bear but half the <lb/>usual or legal interest of the country. This is a tolerable <lb/>evidence of the credit of the Company and the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. There is a great and increasing prosperity in Hin<lb break="no"/>dostan. The augmented cultivation of the Upper Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces within these two years is surprising.</p>
