                <p>The augmentation of the army consists in the formation of two <lb/>regiments, the 94th and 95th infantry, and in the intended raising <lb/>of four others, but which will not be embodied for some time. If <lb/>we look at the previous strength of the army of this extended Em<lb break="no"/>pire, the small increase in question will not only excite no alarm, <lb/>but it will be considered absolutely necessary for ordinary purposes. <lb/>The total number of regulars voted for the last year (exclusive of <lb/>the East Indies) was only 71,000, including officers. These may <lb/>be said to be distributed in the following manner :–</p>
                <p>Great Britain, 18,000 <lb/>Ireland, 24,000 <lb/>West Indies, 7,000 <lb/>North America and Africa, 6,500 <lb/>Gibraltar, Mediterranean, &amp;c. 8,000 <lb/>Cape of Good Hope, } <lb/>Ceylon, } <lb/>Mauritius, } <lb/>New South Wales, }7,500 <lb/>71,000</p>
