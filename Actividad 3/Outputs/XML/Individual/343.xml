                <p><pb n="3"/>The American States having now gained their <lb/>independence, have no cause of quarrel let with <lb/>this country; but matters are very different be<lb break="no"/>tween them and Spain. It is well known, that <lb/>the Indians on the back settlements have been <lb/>regularly supplied with arms and ammunition <cb/>from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies, <lb/>to enable them to distress the Americans, and <lb/>prove at least a hindrance to their growing pro<lb break="no"/>sperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi <lb/>has been denied them?and the Spaniards, now <lb/>in possession of the Floridas, have been continual<lb break="no"/>ly quarrelling with them about their boundaries.</p>
                <p>It may therefore be considered as almost cer<lb break="no"/>tain, that the American states will take an active <lb/>part against Spain. This will be a great acquisi<lb break="no"/>tion to Britain in every point of view; for though <lb/>American cannot furnish money, she can furnish <lb/>men and provisions; and afree intercourse with <lb/>her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the <lb/>security of our West-India Islands. Their pri<lb break="no"/>vateers, too, will be able to take their runs so <lb/>speedily, that the Spanish trade must be very <lb/>materially injured thereby.</p>
