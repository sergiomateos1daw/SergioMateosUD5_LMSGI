                <p><pb/><hi rend="italic">Longevity.</hi> â€“At Taconey, a small village about <lb/>seven miles from Philadelphia, there is now living <lb/>a shoemaker of the name of Robert Glen, who in <lb/>December last attained the great age of <hi rend="italic">one hun - <lb/>dred and fourteen years</hi>. Scotland was the place <lb/>of his nativity; he remembers having seen King <lb/>William III. and was present at the two succeed<lb break="no"/>ing coronations. Neither his memory nor his <lb/>sight, are in the least impaired; and such is his <lb/>strength, that after working all the week at his <lb/>profession, he regularly walks on Sunday to Phila<lb break="no"/>delphia, and back. His third wife is now living, <lb/>and is not more than thirty years old.</p>
