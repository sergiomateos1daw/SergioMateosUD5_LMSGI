                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alarming Fires in the Woods of Main and </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">New Brunswick</hi>.–A gentleman, who arrived here on <lb/>Thursday, in the schooner Active, from Eastport, in<lb break="no"/>forms, that the drought in the neighbourhood of St. <lb/>Croix river, the present season, has been unusually <lb/>severe, and that the fires in the woods have raged to a <lb/>more alarming extent than ever before known. Se<lb break="no"/>veral buildings have been burnt at the parish of St. <lb/>Stephen's on the British side of the river, others were <lb/>saved with a great difficulty. From Calais to Eastport, <lb/>about a fortnight since, the vessel in which our infor<lb break="no"/>mant took passage was entirely enveloped in smoke.– <lb/>In various places, the fires have been burning for six <lb/>weeks ; there had been no rain for eight weeks to wet <lb/>the ground.– <hi rend="italic">Boston Paper</hi>.</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter to a Lady in the vicinity of <lb/>Chelmsford, dated New Essex, Graham's Town, on <lb/>the frontiers of Africa, June 21, 1821:–</p>
                <p>"I am seven hundred miles from the Cape <lb/>of Good Hope, and should not receive intelligence of <lb/>an arrival there for at least three weeks ; but my cor<lb break="no"/>respondent at Cape Town will procure comfortable <lb/>lodgings, &amp;c. until a ship sails for Algoa Bay, which <lb/>is distant from me one hundred and thirty miles.– <lb/>Few ships from England proceed farther than the <lb/>Cape. Good ploughmen are wanted, and good foot<lb break="no"/>ploughs, with spare wrought-iron shares and coulters, <lb/>which are very expensive here ; iron-work nothing <lb/>under 1s. per lb. Ransome's ploughs sell for 14l. <lb/>each. Ploughmen will find plenty of employers, at <lb/>from 2l. to 8l. per month and their board. Meat <lb/>sells at 2d. per lb ; wheat 12s. bushel ; and bar<lb break="no"/>ley 6s. Other articles of housekeeping are about the <lb/>same price as in England ; but, on the other hand, we <lb/>are in one of the healthiest climates in the world, and <lb/>free from rent, tithes, and taxes of every descrip<lb break="no"/>tion. Any one may live here as well with 500l. as in <lb/>his native land with 5000l. The farming work is still[?] <lb/>done with oxen, which are very fine, and bought at <lb/>3l. each ; cows are 30s. ; and sheep, 6s. a-head (hav<lb break="no"/>ing tails that weight 8lb., a complete lump of fat) ; <lb/>clothes, linen, and all English goods, very dear.– <lb/>Good mechanics, of any description, have very high <lb/>wages. A cargo of Ladies would make a good specu<lb break="no"/>lation, in proceeding to the New Settlement ; for all <lb/>that came out with the settlers have got husbands."</p>
                <p>By letters received from the Cape of Good Hope, <lb/>we understand that the Royal African corps was dis<lb break="no"/>banded there on the 26th of June last.</p>
                <p>By letters from Bombay, dated the 24 of May, <lb/>we learn that the Governor, the Honourable Mr. El<lb break="no"/>phinstone, has returned to the Presidency, after a five <lb/>months' tour to the northward. He must minutely <lb/>examined all the judicial and revenue systems–furnish<lb break="no"/>ing the Collectors and Agents of Government with par<lb break="no"/>ticular instructions for their guidance. He also sent <lb/>out strong detachments to reduce some predatory hordes <lb/>who have long plundered the country, and been a ter<lb break="no"/>ror to the peaceable natives. Those plunderers are <lb/>are called Bheels[?]. They live in the hills and woods, and <lb/>descend in bands to commit their depredations. By <lb/>these letters we learn, what is essential for young men <lb/>going out to India to know, that Writers and Cadets <lb/>now undergo an examination as to their knowledge of <lb/>the native languages ; and no youth has a chance of <lb/>success who is ignorant of the Hindoustanee[?]. The <lb/>highest respect is entertained for the able manner in <lb/>which the disinterested Dr. Gilchrist prepares young <lb/>men for the services. We rejoice to learn that the <lb/>Cholera Morbus has abated its rigour in the Deccan.</p>
                <p>Batavia journals of the 28th April give an account <lb/>of a terrible earthquake which took place on the 29th <lb/>December last, on the south coast of Celebes. It did <lb/>immense damage, especially at Budekomba[?], where <lb/>the sea rose several times to a prodigious height, and <lb/>then falling in with the incredible rapidity, alternately <lb/>deluged and left the shore, destroying all the planta<lb break="no"/>tions from Bontain to Boelekomba[?]. Many hundred <lb/>have lost their lives. The fort of Boelekom-[?] <lb/>ba was much damaged, that of Bontain less so. On <lb/>the 4th of January this year, there was another shock <lb/>of an earthquake, but we do not learn that it did any <lb/>damage. <cb/>It is with much regret we lay before our readers the <lb/>following details of a most calamitous fire which broke <lb/>out at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the 17th ult. :</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="smallcaps">Halifax</hi>, Sept. 17. <lb/>"The conflagration this morning was one of the <lb/>most awful and destructive every witness in Halifax. <lb/>It originated in Sackville-street, in the Bakery occu<lb break="no"/>pied by Shay and Milany, and before it was discover<lb break="no"/>ed, had gained an alarming height. It was near two <lb/>o'clock when the bells were rung. The troops, sea<lb break="no"/>mean of his Majesty's ships, and inhabitants, soon as<lb break="no"/>sembled ; the engines were judiciously placed, lines <lb/>formed to different reservoirs of water, and every exer<lb break="no"/>tion made to extinguish the fire, but we regret to state, <lb/>that before any check could be given to it, the whole <lb/>block of buildings, with the exception of a house situ<lb break="no"/>ated at the corner of Sackville and Blowers'-streets, <lb/>occupied by Mr H. Croskill, the houses occupied by <lb/>Mrs. Neilson and Mr T. Muirhead, on Barrington<lb break="no"/>street, and a stable belonging to J. W. Johnston, Esq. <lb/>in Granville-street, were consumed.</p>
                <p>"For some time great apprehensions were entertain<lb break="no"/>tained that the fire would extend to the houses on the op<lb break="no"/>posite side of the streets, but fortunately it did not. <lb/>Of the property burnt only about t1500 were insured, <lb/>and the calamity has mostly fallen where it will long <lb/>be severely felt–upon windows and orphan children– <lb/>upon industrious tradesmen, whose whole stock of <lb/>worldly wealth was invested in the tenements they oc<lb break="no"/>cupied.</p>
                <p>"To the troops, and the seamen of the ships of war, <lb/>the town is, as usual, greatly indebted for the exertions <lb/>made by them. Twenty-one houses were consumed, <lb/>with other valuable property."</p>
                <p>America appears to be very unhealthy just now– <lb/>The accounts from Long Island, Baltimore, Amelia <lb/>Island, and Norfolk, are extremely calamitous. The <lb/>whole of Amelia Island is a perfect hospital, not one <lb/>family being well, and in many instances not one to <lb/>assist another. So dreadful, indeed, is the disease, <lb/>that there is not one sentinel to do duty. A New <lb/>York Paper of the 30th ult. says–</p>
                <p>We are sorry to perceive from the <hi rend="italic">Franklin Gazette</hi>, <lb/>that the malignant fever continues to make serious ra<lb break="no"/>vages among our fellow citizens at Baltimore. Four <lb/>full victims to it in the 24 hours ending on Sunday <lb/>morning ; and six during the 24 hours ending Monday <lb/>morning.</p>
