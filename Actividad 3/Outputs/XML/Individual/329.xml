                <p>"The demands for the produce of America <lb/>are most rapidly increasing: one single house has <lb/>actuallyexported and sold, within a very short <lb/>time, 2000 barrels of pot and pear ashes, 2000 <lb/>barrels of beef, 500 ditto of pork, 70,000lb. <lb/>weight of butter, and 1500 bushels of bean and <lb/>peas.</p>
                <p>"Our news from New York is very disagree<lb break="no"/>able indeed. Gen. Scott, Major Fountain, Ma<lb break="no"/>jor Willis, Capt. M'Murtry, and Lieut. Forting<lb break="no"/>ham, have all fallen sacrifices to the Indians, af<lb break="no"/>ter a terrible conflict on the banks of a river; <pb n="5"/> there were such numbers of the Indians killed,and <lb/>thrown into the river, that their dead bodies ac<lb break="no"/>tually stopped the current of it.</p>

                <p>During the late gales of wind, the smugglers <lb/>have been uncommonly active on all the coasts of <lb/>the kingdom. The risk of their lives secured their <lb/>propertyâ€“for the Custon-house boats were afraid <lb/>to follow them.</p>
                <p>From many parts of the country we have re<lb break="no"/>ceived accounts of the land being entirely flooded <lb/>by the late heavy rains.</p>
                <p>A prisoner who was tried last week <lb/>try town sessions, for stealing iron, being acquitted <lb/>by the Jury, addressed them in the following <lb/>words: "Gentlemen, I most sincerely thank you <lb/>for your lenity, and promise never to be <hi rend="italic">guilty</hi>  of <lb/>the like offence <hi rend="italic">again</hi>."</p>
