                <p>This Colony is in a perfect state of anarchy ; <lb/>is so much that we have had thoughts of quitting <lb/>the island, and going to Trinidad, taking the ne<lb break="no"/>groes with us. Unless some speedy and effectual <lb/>succours arrive, the colony is utterly ruined. The <lb/>greater part of the colonists, this day, assembled <lb/>at Gros-morne.–The grenadiers, who were in <lb/>the fort of Trinity, with twenty three officers of <lb/>the regiment, were glad to make their escape.– <lb/>There are 1500 men in the FOrt Bourbon, many <lb/>of whom are from Dominica, Guadaloupe, and <lb/>other colonies, an supposed to have been sent by <lb/>Martinico refugees.–The firing of cannon is heard <lb/>incessantly ; at this rate the magazine of powder <lb/>will soon be consumed.</p>
                <p>The Municipality of Fort Royal, have been <lb/>obliged to promise and sign whatever the insur<lb break="no"/>gents have been please to dictate.–The soldiers <lb/>run about the streets and oblige the inhabitants to <lb/>give them money.–Imagine, in short, a scene of <lb/>confusion and terror, and you will then have some <cb/>idea of the persent [?] of Fort Bourbon and <lb/>Fort Royal.</p>
                <p>The town of St. Pierre swarms with strangers, <lb/>who come here from all parts. M. Chabrol, Co<lb break="no"/>lonel of the regiment which has been sent here, <lb/>together with a company of Chaffeurs, has been <lb/>appointed comandant o the NAtional troops.</p>
                <p>The women, confident that it is in his power <lb/>to re-establish tranquility, prostrate themselves be<lb break="no"/>fore him, strew the ground on which he walks <lb/>with flowers, and affectionately embrace him.– <lb/>He seems willing to comply with their wishes.</p>
                <p>The Colonial Assembly sits at Gros-morne <lb/>guarded by an army of 4000 men, under the com<lb break="no"/>mand of M. Dumoise, appointed by the General.</p>
                <p>We are assured, that the insurgents are arming <lb/>four privateers with which they mean to attack <lb/>Trinity. Some soldiers attempted to penetrate <lb/>among them, but were repulsed by the Mulattoes.</p>
