               <p><pb n="2"/>By an extract of a letter from <region n="3489940">Jamaica</region> we learn <lb/>the following singular fact;â€“The Captain and <lb/>crew of the brig Exuma, which arrived there <lb/>some days before from <region n="6354959">Newfoundland</region>, hav<lb break="no"/>ing in the course of their passage fallen in with a French schooner, Captain Alward asked the <lb/>Captain of the schooner to accommodate him <lb/>with some nails, which he politely did; at the <lb/>same time begging his acceptance of some barra<lb/>coutes caught that morning. Captain Aylward <lb/>and his crew having dined off them the same day, <lb/>they were immediately seized with violent sickness <lb/>convulsive fits, and other dangerous symptoms. <lb/>The Captain, judging that the fish they had ea<lb break="no"/>ten were of a poisonous nature, conceived that <lb/>salt water might be of service, he instantly made <lb/>the expedient on himself, which relieved him <lb/>greatly ; he applied the same remedy to his crew <lb/>and it was attended with good effects. When <lb/>this unfortunate accident happened, it was luc<lb break="no"/>kily a dead calm ; had the weather been tempes<lb break="no"/>tous, it is more than probable the ship and crew <lb/>would have been lost, as during their sickness, there was not a man able to stand by the helm.</p>
