                <p>By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Fowler</hi>, and part of the crew of the India brig Matilda, which sailed from this colony in August, <lb/>1813, bound on a voyage to the Derwent and <lb/>Eastern Islands, and from thence to China; but was <lb/>cut off and plundered on the night of the 10th of <lb/>April last, while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay, at <lb/>the Island of Rooapoah, one of the Marquesas, on a <lb/>sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomootoo <lb/>men) had previously deserted, and joining with some <lb/>of the Rooapoah natives, took the opportunity of a <lb/>dark night, and the wind blowing fresh right on the <lb/>land, to cut the vessel adrift; by which means she <lb/>drove ashore through a heavy surf, and was soon <lb/>bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel <lb/>afloat, they concurred universally in the design of <lb/>putting the whole of her crew to death; which appears <lb/>to have been a constant practise among the different <lb/>natives towards one another, when their canoes hap<lb break="no"/>pen to fall upon a strange shore, through stress of <lb/>weather, or from any other accident.</p>
                <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with <lb/>their Chief, or King, Nooahetu, who presided at the <lb/>horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate <lb/>mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld his assent <lb/>to the murder; but had no hesitation in permitting <lb/>the plunder of the vessel. The crew were informed <lb/>by such expressions as they could understand, as well <lb/>as by gesticulations that accompanied their vehement <lb/>debate on the occasion, that their lives were depen<lb break="no"/>dent on the issue; the good Chief was opposed by <lb/>many other Chiefs, who, though somewhat inferior in <lb/>rank, were very far superior in number, supported <lb/>by the common usages of the island, from which the <lb/>exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable de<lb break="no"/>viation. He was seated, with his son by his side, on <lb/>a mat in his own dwelling; he had been called to the <lb/>supremacy of the island by the general wish of the <lb/>people, as it was not an hereditary right, but an elec<lb break="no"/>tive dignity. His people pressed their solicitations <lb/>earnestly, and at length peremptorily demanded his <lb/>assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length of time <lb/>opposed by the force of words; which not seeming <lb/>likely to prevail, he adopted a method which silenced <lb/>the whole in an instant, and saved the lives of Cap<lb break="no"/>tain <hi rend="smallcaps">Fowler</hi>  and his crew. Finding that all his ex<lb break="no"/>postulations were defeated upon the principle of un<lb break="no"/>deviating custom, he deliberately took up two ropes <lb/>that were near him, and fixing one round the neck <lb/>of his son, and the other round his own, called to <lb/>the Chief next in command, who immediately ap<lb break="no"/>proached him. His conference was short and deci<lb break="no"/>sive; he first pointed to the cord that encircled the <lb/>neck of his son, and then to the other, which he had <lb/>entwined round his own. "These strangers are <lb/>doomed to death," said he, "by my chiefs and my <lb/>people, and it is not fit that I, who am their King, <lb/>should live to see so vile a deed perpetrated. Let my <lb/>child and myself be strangled before it is performed; <lb/>and then it never will be said that we sanctioned, <lb/>even with our eye-sight, the destruction of these un<lb break="no"/>offending people."</p>
                <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do <lb/>less than produce, even in the mind of the unen<lb break="no"/>lightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise, mingled <lb/>with a sentiment of admiration in which the untaught <lb/>man may possibly excel his fellow-creature–whose <lb/>conceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to <lb/>guard him from the extremes of passion. For a mo<lb break="no"/>ment the people looked wildly upon their King, <lb/>whose person they adored, because that his princi<lb break="no"/>ples were good, and his government just and mild. <lb/>They saw the obedient Chief, to whom the order of <lb/>strangulation had been imparted, staring with hor<lb break="no"/>ror and amazement at the change which a few mo<lb break="no"/>ments had produced; the mandate that had pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed; <lb/>and commanded to perform the dreadful office, he <lb/>proceeded to obey–when a sudden shout from <lb/>the multitude awed him to forbearance. "The <lb/>King! the King!" from every lip burst forth– <lb/>"What! kill the King! No, no, let all the strangers <lb/>live –no man shall kill the King!" Thus were <lb/>their lives preserved–and the vessel plundered of <lb/>every thing on board her.</p>
                <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at <lb/>Nooaheva, still remains, and is dry at low water. All <lb/>her iron and copper have been taken out by the na<lb break="no"/>tives, who have a thorough knowledge of the use of <lb/>these materials. That they are cannibals is well as<lb break="no"/>certained. They form distinct factions, and make <lb/>war upon the ruling Chief–the rebels are denomi<lb break="no"/>nated the Typees; and the opposite parties are hor<lb break="no"/>ribly sanguinary towards each. Six of the adverse <lb/>party were killed, and devoured by the rebels while <lb/>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Fowler</hi>  was among them, and the following <lb/>detestable circumstance occurred on the occasion:– <lb/>A native man belonging to Port Anna Maria, who <lb/>was not tattooed, and in consequence prohibited from <lb/>the eating of human flesh, on pain of death, impa<lb break="no"/>tient of the restraint, fell upon one of the murdered <lb/>bodies, and darting his teeth into it in all the mad<lb break="no"/>ness of a voracious fury, exhaled the crimson mois<lb break="no"/>ture, which had not yet coagulated.</p>
                <p>The Chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very <lb/>friendly to Europeans, is named Ke-atta-nooe, the <lb/>first part of the name implying the outrigger of a <lb/>canoe, and the latter signifying great. The dress of <lb/>the men consists merely of a wrapper about the <lb/>waist; the women are covered from the shoulders downwards to the ancles, and are generally fairer <lb/>than the Taheitan women. The Chiefs have no dis<lb break="no"/>tinguishing mark or ornament, but in the mode of <lb/>wearing their hair; which the common orders wear <lb/>tied up in a large knot on each side of the head, a <lb/>stripe of which, extending from the forehead to the <lb/>hollow of the neck, is kept shorn, which practice the <lb/>Chiefs do not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the <lb/>worms to be more prevalent and destructive to the ships' <cb/>bottoms there, than he has anywhere else witnessed; and <lb/>to this cause attributes the caution of the natives in <lb/>drawing up their largest canoes, some of which con<lb break="no"/>tain from 80 to 100 warriors. They are anxious <lb/>after every kind of property carried among them for <lb/>barter, and this is supposed their chief inducement <lb/>for attacking vessels when they can do so with a pro<lb break="no"/>bability of accomplishing their object. They have <lb/>no knowledge of the use of muskets, and have none <lb/>among them except a few at Port Anna Maria. A <lb/>Gentleman, at this time in Sydney, who resided <lb/>among them about 15 years ago in a missionary ca<lb break="no"/>pacity, describes them as a people constantly employ<lb break="no"/>ing their thoughts on plunder, and devising schemes <lb/>for taking advantage of strangers. Their popula<lb break="no"/>tion is very numerous; which he remarked to <lb/>some of them, to whom he gave a description of Otaheite, observing, at the same time, that its inhabitants were <lb/>less numerous:–"Cannot we go and take them?– <lb/>What is there to hinder us?"–was immediately de<lb break="no"/>manded. This anecdote we notice as a specimen of <lb/>their natural inclination to hostility, in which, all ac<lb break="no"/>counts respecting them correspond.</p>
