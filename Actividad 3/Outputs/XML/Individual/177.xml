                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to Canada</hi></p>
                <p>The following is an extract of a letter from a tradesman <lb/>belonging to Glasgow, who has been six years in Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, to a friend in this city :–</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="italic">York, Upper Canada, 14th November</hi>, 1820. <lb/>"You wish to be informed of the encouragement that you <lb/>might meet with by an emigration to this country; and as <lb/>you have determined to place the most implicit confidence <lb/>in what I may advance. I shall therefore state to you the <lb/>"truth, and nothing but tl[?] truth, so help me <hi rend="italic">God</hi>."– <lb/>In the first place, you wish to know what might be the va<lb break="no"/>lue of a hundred acres of land, with six or eight acres of <lb/>improvement. This is a question that I cannot give a de<lb break="no"/>cided answer to, as it depends entirely on the situation <lb/>where you wish to purchase; but I may with safety aver<lb break="no"/>age wild land, in this Upper Province, say at 4 to 6 dol<lb break="no"/>lars per acre, and the clearing or improving of each acre <lb/>will cost you from 16 to 20dollars.–In the next place, you <lb/>wish to know the price of cattle. They have never been <lb/>known to be cheaper than at the present time. A cow can <lb/>be purchased at 20 dollars, a pair of working oxen at 40 <lb/>dollars; a good cart horse at 50 dollars,; sheep, 2 dollars a<lb break="no"/>piece. In regard to farming utensils, there are but few <lb/>used in this country at any time, and a new settler may be <lb/>some years in the woods before we want any more than an <lb/>axe, (3 dollars) a plough, (10 dollars) and a harrow, (5 dol<lb break="no"/>lars.)–You wish to know the nature of a Government <lb/>grant; that has now become no object, as the charges made <lb/>by Government exceed in many cases what you can pur<lb break="no"/>chase land for; and by buying land you have the advan<lb break="no"/>tage of choosing a situation agreeable to your mind; but <lb/>the reverse is the case when you accept of a grant from Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, for you must then take your chance by drawing <lb/>by lottery; and as the land is already taken up for forty <lb/>miles round this place, you will then be obliged to go back <lb/>into the woods, and out of the world. You are at liberty <lb/>to sell it as soon as you receive the grant; formerly you <lb/>could.–You wish to know what sum you could estab<lb break="no"/>lish yourself for in this country as a farmer. There is one <lb/>thing obvious–the more you bring the less miseries and <lb/>difficulties you will have to undergo. But as a true friend, <lb/>I would advise you not to think of leaving home with a <lb/>sum less than t200 sterling with a sum less than this you <lb/>undoubtedly subject yourself to hardships and troubles <lb/>that you have no idea of. Though many have settled here <lb/>for nothing, their fate has been such that it is beyond my <lb/>pend to describe; and my greatest enemy I should not ad<lb break="no"/>vise to come to this country, with the intention of farming, <lb/>with less capital than I have no stated to you. Many <lb/>may flatter you, and stuff your head with golden dreams <lb/>about this country; but you must allow the experience that <lb/>I have had to outweigh the statements of many that you <lb/>may have had an opportunity of talking with, who may pre<lb break="no"/>tend to have some knowledge of this country, for there <lb/>are but few settlements between Montreal and the falls of <lb/>Niagara (a distance of nearly 600 miles,) that I have not <lb/>visited.–As to the necessaries wanted for a family who may <lb/>think of coming to this country, I should entirely confine <lb/>myself to wearing apparel, as clothes are the highest article <lb/>in this country; and should you think of farming, I would <lb/>advise you to bring but few fine clothes, but principally <lb/>coarse and stout. Heavy luggage of any kind becomes very <lb/>expensive and cumbersome bringing you up the river so far as <lb/>this, and is often liable to be damaged, in consequence of <lb/>the repeated re-shipping. The rate of charge of the trans<lb break="no"/>portation of good from Montreal to Kingston (200 miles) <lb/>is 2 dollars per cwt.; and from Kingston to York (200 <lb/>miles) they charge 1 dollar for each barrel bulk; and from <lb/>Montreal to York you may get a passage for 10 dollars for <lb/>each grown person.–By the by, you wish to know the po<lb break="no"/>pulation of this town: it is indeed small in comparison to <lb/>some of your towns; but I might say that the inhabitants of <lb/>York might amount to 3000 people. But there is no place <lb/>that I have visited in my travels that is more thriving than <lb/>this town; and as a proof, I can safely say that it is now <lb/>twice the size that it was when I came here, (now three <lb/>years), and still continuing to increase greatly in buildings; <lb/>but all wood.–You wish to know the different branches of <lb/>business carried on here. They are principally house car<lb break="no"/>penters; and various other mechanics are also employed <lb/>here.–You wish to know if any of the emigrants have ar<lb break="no"/>rived in this place. There are but very few I understand <lb/>come thus far, the greater part of them having stopped at a <lb/>settlement called Perth, about miles below Kingston. <lb/>–Since I have now given answers to all your different <lb/>queries, let me now give my candid opinion respecting this <lb/>country. In the first instance, a farmer may live by hard <lb/>labour; that is, he may acquire a livelihood; but cash[?] is a <lb/>complete hidden treasure, and is as forbidden fruit to the <lb/>farmer of this country; and in some places you may live <lb/>for years and not even behold, a silver dollar through a glass <lb/>darkly, as all is done by barter in the country. The next <lb/>evil is the mixture of society; a very few good, intermixed <lb/>with a multitude of a very different character; but in many <lb/>places you will be divested of all society, either of a good <lb/>or bad quality; in either of which situations I am afraid you <lb/>will find yourself uncomfortable, in consequence of its <lb/>being so much different to what you have been accus<lb break="no"/>tomed to; and the opportunity of spending the sabbath <lb/>in a religious worship you will also find wanting. And <lb/>above all evils the fever and ague, that none escape, is <lb/>the ruin of many a family in this country. But should <lb/>you think of coming to this country, in order to avoid this <lb/>disease I would advise you to come no farther up the coun<lb break="no"/>try than Perth settlement, where this loathsome sickness <lb/>is seldom known. Now, my friend, by what I have stated <lb/>here I neither mean to advise or dissuade you from com<lb break="no"/>ing to this country; but take it into serious consideration <lb/>before you embark upon this important."</p>
