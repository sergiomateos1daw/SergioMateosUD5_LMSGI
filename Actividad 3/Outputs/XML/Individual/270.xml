                <p><pb/>Thus the British Government is multiplying its <lb/>colonies round the shores of New Holland. Exclusive <lb/>of Van Diemen's Land, which forms a separate island, <lb/>we have first on the eastern shore the old settlement of <lb/>Port Jackson ; a second recently formed at Port Philip, <lb/>500 miles south from Sidney ; a third just described, at <lb/>St. Vincent's Gulf, 500 miles west from Port Philip ; <lb/>a fourth at King George's Sound, 1100 miles west <lb/>from St Vincent's Gulf ; a fifth at Swan River, 250 <lb/>miles north from King George's South. All these <lb/>colonies are in the temperate zone, between the lati<lb break="no"/>tudes of 30 and 38, and will have nearly the <lb/>same climate. We had one at Melville Island, <lb/>on the north coast, within the torried zone, in latitude <lb/>12 ; but it was found to be very unhealthy, and was <lb/>abandoned, after a short trial, ten years ago.</p>
                <p>Though the interior of New Holland, so far as <lb/>hitherto explored, is one of the most barren and un<lb break="no"/>promising lands in the world, there is a margin of <lb/>good soil round the greater part of its coasts, capabale <lb/>[?] of supporting twenty or thirty or fifty mil<lb break="no"/> <cb/>lions of inhabitants; and there is little doubt that, in <lb/>the course of three centuries, it will be the seat of a <lb/>great and powerful nation, cultivating the arts, and <lb/>speaking the language of Britain, and contributing <lb/>powerfully to spread civilisation over the Southern <lb/>Hemisphere.</p>
