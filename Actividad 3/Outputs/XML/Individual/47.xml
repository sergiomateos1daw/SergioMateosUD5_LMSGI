                <p><pb/>Governor Philips describes Port Jackson, which <lb/>is only about nine miles to the Northward of <lb/>Botany Bay in South Wales, on the Coast of <lb/>Holland, as one of the finest harbours in the <lb/>world, in which 1000 sail of the line might ride <lb/>in perfect security. Sydney cove, named so in <lb/>honour of Lord Sydney, the Governor chose in <lb/>preference, which is about hal a mile in length, <lb/>and a quarter of a mile across at the entrance. <lb/>Here was the finest spring water, and ships can <lb/>anchor so close in short, that at a very small expence <lb/>quays may be constructed, at which the largest <lb/>vessels may constantly unload. His meeting with <lb/>the natives here was friendly and uninterrupted. <lb/>The appearance of the place was picturesque and <lb/>pleasing, and it afforded an ample harvest for <lb/>botanical acquisitions.</p>
