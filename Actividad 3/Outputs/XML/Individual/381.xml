                <p><pb n="3"/><hi rend="small-caps">Coroner's Inquest</hi>.–At half past two o'clock <lb/>yesterday, an Inquest was held at the Nag's Head, <lb/>Orange-court, Leicester-fields, before Anthony Gell, <lb/>Esq. Coroner for Westminster, on the body of Mada<lb break="no"/>moiselle Ann Paris, then lying dead at No. 4, St. Mar<lb break="no"/>tin's-street, Leicester-fields.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sarah Upton</hi>  deposed, that she is housemaid to the <lb/>place; that the deceased had lodged about seven <lb/>weeks in the house, during which time the witness at<lb break="no"/>tended more particularly than any other servant about the <lb/>person of the deceased. She had frequently observed <lb/>that the unfortunate young lady appeared to be rather <lb/>flighty and tiresome in her manner, such as ringing the <lb/>bell violently, giving orders and almost immediately <lb/>after giving counter-orders; at other times she would <lb/>ring with equal violence, and when any of the servants <lb/>inquired what she wanted, she would tell them she <lb/>wanted nothing. She was also extremely incoherent in <lb/>her discourse, rambling from one subject to another <lb/>with the utmost rapidity, and without there being the <lb/>least connection between each.</p>
                <p>In answer to a question from one of the Jurymen, the <lb/>witness said that the deceased was by no means in the <lb/>habit of drinking, but that on the day on which the un<lb break="no"/>fortunate affair took place, she thought the deceased <lb/>appeared wild, as if she had been drinking.</p>
                <p>At one time the deceased told the witness that some one <lb/>had said she was mad; another time she gave the wit<lb break="no"/>ness a shilling to buy her some laudanum. The witness <lb/>said " Good God, Miss, you surely must be mad to <lb/>think of such a thing; besides you know it is contrary <lb/>to law, and I can't procure it." She then set down <lb/>and wept bitterly; she said she could get it in a minute; <lb/>she had been used to take it for a pain in her bowels.– <lb/>The witness replied, "Very well, Miss, you may kill <lb/>yourself, but I shall not give my assistance to the deed." <lb/>At other times, the poor young lady would be to all <lb/>appearances in excellent spirits, when all of a sudden <lb/>she would burst into tears, without any thing being <lb/>said or done at the time to occasion it. She would <lb/>sometimes fiddle with her clothes, like a person who <lb/>was beside herself; she would collect a few flowers and <lb/>deck her hair with them, and a thousand other little <lb/>tricks that appeared to to the witness to be the most mani<lb break="no"/>fest proofs of a deranged intellect. On Wednesday, she <lb/>went out at two, and returned at half after six o'clock. <lb/>She then said, that she had given a coachman a 1l. <lb/>note at Brompton, she had to pay the man only 2s. <lb/>but she would not wait for her change, as she thought <lb/>it was much better to lose money than time. She <lb/>went out about a quarter of an hour, after the <lb/>time of her coming home, and returned again <lb/>at eight o'clock, having her bonnet all bedizened <lb/>with artificial flowers. She got a candle, went up <lb/>to her own apartments, and returned in about seven <lb/>minutes time; she refused to take tea with two <lb/>ladies that were in the parlour at the time; she sat down <lb/>at first in an extremely pensive manner, then, in the <lb/>course of a minute or two, with the utmost wildness in <lb/>her countenance, she exclaimed, "Oh, I shall never <lb/>see him again! I have done the job–I have taken <lb/>good care that the laudanum I took should do the busi<lb break="no"/>ness." The witness was instantly alarmed, knowing <lb/>that the deceased had ordered her to get some laudanum <lb/>for her before then. She ran up stairs in the utmost <lb/>consternation, and saw the phials in the lady's chamber. <lb/>Upon her return she endeavoured to get some explana<lb break="no"/>tion for the poor young lady as to what induced her to <lb/>commit such an act of desperation, but in vain–she <lb/>looked wild, and continued raving for some time, and <lb/>then fell into a state of stupefaction. Immediately <lb/>on the unfortunate occurrence being known, medi<lb break="no"/>cal assistance was sent for; three Professional Gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen attended, but they could afford her no relief. <lb/>She died before daylight on Thursday morning. The <lb/>witness knew nothing of any particular visitor to the de<lb break="no"/>ceased; neither had she the least knowledge of <lb/>any of her relations or friends.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. Emanuel Gristock</hi>, of Wardour-street, surgeon, <lb/>stated, that between ten and eleven on Wednesday <lb/>night he saw the deceased; she refused all medicine that <lb/>was offered her for the purpose of expelling the poison; <lb/>with some difficulty, however, the witness forced part of <lb/>an emetic down her throat; she said she new she had <lb/>done wrong; and in disjointed sentences and in broken <lb/>accents raved something about her loving a young man. <lb/>Upon examining her apartment the witness found one <lb/>small bottle full of laudanum, and two others empty, <lb/>which evidently had contained the same sort of poison<lb break="no"/>ous liquid; their contents must have been between two <lb/>and three ounces. He left the patient at twelve, being <lb/>under the necessity of attending another at Knights - <lb/>bridge.</p>
                <p>Mr. <hi rend="italic">James Wilkes</hi>, of the Haymarket, surgeon, saw <lb/>the deceased at half after two on Thursday morning; <lb/>she was then in a state of actual torpor, the nervous <lb/>system appeared to be totally deranged, and she was <lb/>incapable of making the least exertion with her body <lb/>or limbs. She appeared to be past all hopes of recovery <lb/>from the moment the witness saw her. However, hav<lb break="no"/>ing been previously apprised of the situations of the pa<lb break="no"/>tient, the witness had taken a bottle containing an eme<lb break="no"/>tic in his pocket. With the utmost difficulty he forced <lb/>part of it down her throat, but it had no effect–the <lb/>patient continued in the same torpid state until five <lb/>o'clock in the morning, when she expired. Dr. Hoop<lb break="no"/>er prescribed some other medicines, which we at<lb break="no"/>tempted to be administered, ut in vain; the patient <lb/>was totally incapable of swallowing them.</p>
                <p>A jeweller had known the young lady for a consi<lb break="no"/>derable length of time; he had served her with a va<lb break="no"/>riety of trinkets in his line of business, and was in the <lb/>constant habit of attending her two or three times a <lb/>week. He had frequently observed the poor unfortu<lb break="no"/>nate young lady act with the utmost inconsistency and <lb/>wildness; he had repeatedly known her to burst into <lb/>tears in the midst of apparent merriment; he had known <lb/>her to order clothes to dress for going out, then turn <lb/>short and saw she would not go out that day; and he <lb/>had known her once ,after sitting for some time in the <lb/>most pensive mode imaginable, start up suddenly, and <lb/>exclaim, "No, I will not stand this." She was be<lb break="no"/>tween 17 and 18 years of age; he understood that she <lb/>was born in France, but she spoke English as well as <lb/>French. The day before the occurance of the me<lb break="no"/>lancholy transaction, which was the subject of the prev<lb break="no"/>sent consideration of the Jury, she had, with frenzy de<lb break="no"/>picted in her countenance, exclaimed, "Well, if my <lb/>wishes are not fulfilled, I shall hang or drown myself." <lb/>The witness had not the least knowledge of what she <lb/>alluded to neither had he ever heard that she had any <lb/>relations in London. He was most decidedly of opi<lb break="no"/>nion that she was deranged in her intellects.</p>
                <p>The Jury without a moment's hesitation, returned <lb/>their verdict– <hi rend="italic">Insanity</hi>.</p>
                <p>The history of this poor young creature is at once <lb/>romantic and interesting. She is the daughter of a <lb/>Monsieur Paris, who was well known in the commence<lb break="no"/>ment of the Revolution, and in which he suffered.– <lb/>Madame Paris, with her infant daughter, took refuge <lb/> <cb/> in this country, and in the ruin of her fortune, became <lb/>a governess in a noble family in Scotland. After this <lb/>she had a house in the New-road; and, about two years <lb/>ago died of the rupture of a blood vessel. Her daugh<lb break="no"/>ter had been placed at an eminent boarding-school near <lb/>one of the new squares; and on the death of her mother <lb/>was placed under the guardianship of a Member of Par<lb break="no"/>liament, who, with the most liberal and benevolent at<lb break="no"/>tention to her destitute situation, resolved to compleat <lb/>her education; and she had every master of eminence in <lb/>all the elegant arts. She spoke French and Italian; <lb/>touched the piano with great execution; sung with <lb/>taste; and had read beyond her years.</p>
                <p>About six or eight months ago, she was met in the <lb/>square, when walking with the other young ladies by a <lb/>young man in the dress of a midshipman, who followed <lb/>her to the door, and who wrote to her under the name <lb/>of Jones. A correspondence took place. Her ima<lb break="no"/>gination was fired; and she eloped with him under a <lb/>promise of marriage. His address was found in her <lb/>box, and they were traced by her guardian, and sepa<lb break="no"/>rated. Jones declared that she was virtuous, and his in<lb break="no"/>tentions were honourable; and as a proof of it he was <lb/>ready to marry her with her guardian's consent. In <lb/>effect they were married, and she was completely un<lb break="no"/>done. In about a fortnight or three weeks Jones <lb/>threw off his disguise, and fairly told her his real <lb/>character,– that he was no sailor, but lived by his <lb/>shifts; that he had married her only for the sum, <lb/>her Protector had paid him, and that she must provide <lb/>for herself. She was abandoned; and the shock <lb/>had such an effect on her imagination, that she has <lb/>ever since shewed signs of a disordered intellect. With <lb/>a heart that shrunk from vice, she was flung on the <lb/>world without a friend, or a home; and in this deplo<lb break="no"/>rable state she became the victim of necessity.</p>
                <p>About three weeks ago she saw an officer, who is <lb/>distinguished for his gallantries, and who by his ad<lb break="no"/>dress and attentions so won upon her affections, that <lb/>she could neither speak nor think of any other object. <lb/>This fatal attachment absorbed her whole soul. They <lb/>entered into engagements to live and die only for one <lb/>another; and in the frenzy of this passion, or under the <lb/>idea that she could not be his, and his alone, she took the <lb/>desperate resolution of dying for him. She had pre<lb break="no"/>pared three phials of opium, who of which she swal<lb break="no"/>lowed; and she died with a spirit of heroism; for no <lb/>persuasion nor force could make her, when seized <lb/>with the nausea of the poison, take any antidote to the <lb/>draughts. She would not suffer the medical men to <lb/>approach her–and though after stupefaction came on <lb/>they administered every known medicine, they all fail<lb break="no"/>ed of effect.</p>
