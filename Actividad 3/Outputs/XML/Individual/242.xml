                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">South Australian Emigration </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Association.</hi></p>
                <p>A meeting of the members of the South Australian Asso<lb break="no"/>ciation was held on Monday, at Exeter Hall, "for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of explaining the principles, objects, plan, and prospects <lb/>of a new colony," proposed to be founded in South Australia. <lb/>Mr W. Whitmore in the chair.</p>
                <p>Upon taking the chair, Mr Whitmore stated, that the first <lb/>question which the meeting would have to consider would be <lb/>this–whether there existed or not at present any necessity <lb/>for a more extended system of colonization. It appeared to <lb/>him that there was a great defect in our present system of <lb/>colonication, and that it would be greatly to our advantage if <lb/>we established it upon a new principle, well and seriously <lb/>considered. That which struck him as the greatest defect <lb/>was, that we did not provided that colonization which in<lb break="no"/>cluded within it members of all classes of society. Large <lb/>numbers of emigrants went out with capital, but not carry<lb break="no"/>ing with them that number of the lower class which was <lb/>necessary to employ their capital to advantage. In other <lb/>cases, perhaps almost as numerous, the labourer went out <lb/>without capital which was necessry to enable him to employ <lb/>his labour to advantage. This was a striking defect. Now <lb/>the question which they were then called upon to consider, <lb/>regarded the best means of remedying that defect. Those <lb/>means, it appeared to him, were quite practicable, and might <lb/>be accomplished in this manner, vz. by establishing as a sys<lb break="no"/>tem that all the waste lands which they were about to colo<lb break="no"/>nize should be sold at a given price, such as the market would <lb/>command, and that the proceeds of such sales should be <lb/>employed in sending out to the colonies a sufficient number <lb/>of labourers to cultivate the lands so sold. If this system <lb/>could be carried into effect, he apprehended that all the evils <lb/>of our present system of colonization would be removed, and <lb/>that we should be enabled to transplant a portion of the com<lb break="no"/>munity of the mother country with all its various grades into <lb/>the new country which they now proposed to coloniz. He <lb/>believed that if we proceeded upon this principle, we should <lb/>lay the foundation of the greatest colony which England had <lb/>ever settled.</p>
                <p>Mr Grote, M.P., moved the first resolution,–"That the <lb/>wealth and prosperity of this country have been greatly pro<lb break="no"/>moted by the establishment of British colonies in various <lb/>parts of the world, and that colonization, when conducted <lb/>systematically and upon sound principles, offers the means of <lb/>extending indefinitely the commercial empire of the united <lb/>kingdom, and the field of employment for British capital and <lb/>labour." He would not enter into the recommendations <lb/>which this undertaking offered to all classes of the communi<lb break="no"/>ty ; but he would venture to state, that to any gentleman <lb/>who considered the prospectus which had been put out by the <lb/>association, and who recollected that it was a matter of cer<lb break="no"/>tainty that the land in the colony was to be used as the means <lb/>of raising a fund to carry over thither the labour, which was <lb/>superabundant here, it must be evident that from this impor<lb break="no"/>tant innovation on our colonial system great benefit must be <lb/>derived[?] both to the new colony and to the mother country.</p>
                <p>Mr Clay, M.P., in seocnding the resolution, entered at <lb/>great length into the difficulty of finding employment, which <lb/>now prevails in all parts of the community, and then, after <lb/>condemning the corn laws, continued thus–Colonization, if <lb/>carried on to a considerable extent, would as effectually add <lb/>millions of fertile acres to our shores as if the Irish sea were <lb/>filled up with fertile land. If that miracle took place is it <lb/>not clear that all distress would immediately cease, and that <lb/>the emplyment which the addition of so many fertile acres <lb/>would afford must give a new stimulus to the prosperity of <lb/>the country ? Is it not clear that the miserable compotation[?] <lb/>for potato-gardens in Ireland would cease, and that the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties flowing from an unemployed population would cease ? <lb/>Does any man doubt that it would be well worth the while of <lb/>our capitalists to take such land at from 10s to 20s an acre. <lb/>(Hear.) Yet this plan is in effect the same as if the land were <lb/>added to our own island, because, if this plan of colonization <lb/>be adopted, a transplantation of a sufficiency of labourers, <lb/>now wanting employment, from this country, for its culture, <lb/>will take place, which is equivalent to the transportation of <lb/>the land to the labourer. In point of fact, the ocean joins <lb/>these distant lands, instead of separating them. (Hear.)– <lb/>There can be no doubt but that a wider comercial code, and <lb/>the removal of restrictions on labour, would greatly facilitate, <lb/>extend, and increase the commercial intercourse between the <lb/>old nation of the world ; but in no case would the increase <lb/>be in proportion to that which might be calculated on, as the <lb/>consequence of a connection with newly-formed countries in <lb/>other climates. As regards the establishment of colonies, it <lb/>is virtually an extension of the mother country.</p>
                <p>Colonel Torrens, M.P., proposed the second resolution– <lb/>"That in establishing colonies, great care ought to be taken <lb/>to combine labour and capital with land, in such propor<lb break="no"/>tions as are best calculated to insure the prosperity of all <lb/>classes of society, and that, in establishing modern colonies, <lb/>this important consideration has been so generally overlook<lb break="no"/>ed." It was, he said, almost unnecessary for him to state that <lb/>in all systems of colonization, land, labour, and capital, ought <lb/>to be combinedin just proportions ; and yet this simple prin<lb break="no"/> <lb/>ciple had been hitherto greatly neglected by those who had <lb/>led new colonies from the mother country. In the first place, <lb/>the whole of the land of this colony was to be public land. <lb/>No individual was to obtain a single acre by gift. There was <lb/>to be no patronage, no job–all were to be on a footing of <lb/>equality, and nobody was to have a single inch of land for <lb/>nothing. There would also be another advantage in this sys<lb break="no"/>tem, which would arise in the following :–In other co<lb break="no"/>lonies, the labourer who had gone out and found that he could <lb/>get land for nothing, had often fallen into the mistake that <lb/>land was wealth, instead of it being merely the means of <lb/>producing wealth. That fatal mistake had often led him to <lb/>refuse the work of the master with whom he had gone out, <lb/>and set up for himself as an independent landowner. He had <lb/>in consequence set up, where he was far away from the mar<lb break="no"/>ket of the colony, where he had no roads over which to convey <lb/>his produce, and where he had perished miserably. But in <lb/>this colony the labourers would be compelled for some time <lb/>to work for hire.</p>
                <p>Mr Guest, M.P. seconded the resolution.</p>
                <p>Mr Hutt, M.P. moved the third resolution to the following <lb/>effect:–"That in order to promote the greatest prosperity of <lb/>a new colony, it is expedient that all waste land, without any <lb/>exception, shall be declared public land, and be disposed of to <lb/>individuals by sale only, and according to an uniform, impar<lb break="no"/>tial, and permanent system."</p>
                <p>Captain Gowan seconded the resolution, and spoke in the <lb/>highest terms of the salubrity of the climate of Australia. <lb/>Many of his fellow soldiers in India had gone there for the <lb/>recovery of their health, and had found something so tem<lb break="no"/>perate and soothing in the country, that they had retired <lb/>there altogeher, preferring its mild and gentle breeze to the <lb/>chills of their native country, England.</p>
                <p>Mr P. Scrope, M.P. moved "That it is also desirable that <lb/>the whole of the purchase money of public land, without any <lb/>deduction, should be employed in providing a free passage <lb/>from the mother country to the colony, of young adult per<lb break="no"/>sons of the labouring class, who may be willing to emigrate, <lb/>and in equal proportion of both sexes." As the want of <lb/>labour was the great difficulty in all infant colonies, the <lb/>more labour they imported, the greater labour did they give <lb/>their land ; the more they got for the sale of it, the greater <lb/>was their power of importing fresh labour. This resolution, <lb/>therefore, acted in a reciprocal manner upon itself, and when <lb/>it was once fairly put into operation they would proceed on<lb break="no"/>wards on the road to prosperity with accelerated velocity, <lb/>meeting with no other obstacle than the unwillingness of <lb/>England to part with her inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Mr Wilks, M.P. seconded the resolution.</p>
                <p>Mr Handson moved –"That amongst the unoccupied por<lb break="no"/>tions of the earth which form part of the British dominions, <lb/>the south coast of Australia appears to be a sport peculiarly <lb/>suitable for founding a colony upon the principles embodied <lb/>in the preceding resolutions." The place where this colony <lb/>was to be founded was one distinguished from every other <lb/>part of Australia, from its possessing a facility of internal <lb/>communications prior even to the formation of roads, and <lb/>the soil would amply repay the labour expended on its culti<lb break="no"/>vation.</p>
                <p>Mr Robert Owen (not of Lanark) said that the coasts of <lb/>this colony abounded with whales, and that its whale fishe<lb break="no"/>ries might become valuable.</p>
                <p>Mr M. D. Hill rose to propose the resolution embodying the <lb/>mode of carrying the principles of this association into effect. <lb/>No colony could go on without some law. He did not care <lb/>how little they had of it, provided they made up in quality <lb/>what was deficient in quantity. The hon. member entered <lb/>into an elaborate description of the laws intended to be enact<lb break="no"/>ed for the colony, and concluded by moving–"That the <lb/>provisions for the peace, order, and good government of the <lb/>British Province of South Australia, as contained in the bill <lb/>now before Parliament, are highly satisfactory."</p>
                <p>Mr D. Wakefield seconded the resolution.</p>
                <p>Sir W. Molesworth, M.P. proposed, and Mr Childers, M.P., <lb/>seconded the following resolution :–"That it is the opinion <lb/>of this meeting that the thanks of the country are due to Mr <lb/>Spring Rice for his prompt and enlightened conduct in pro<lb break="no"/>moting the beneficial public object of the South Australian <lb/>Association."</p>
                <p>The resolutions were carried unanimously. Thanks were <lb/>given to the Chairman, and the meeting, at which many <lb/>ladies were present, broke up. The proceedings lasted from <lb/>twelve o'clock to a quarter before five.</p>
