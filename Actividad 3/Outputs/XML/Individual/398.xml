                <p><pb n="6"/>By letters received from <settlement n="4776222">Norfolk</settlement> in <region n="6254928">Virginia</region>, <lb/>dated the 23rd of July, we learn that on the 10th <lb/>of that month the ship Betsey of Greenock, Capt. <lb/>James Young, had arrived there in 19 days from <lb/><region n="3489940">Jamaica</region>, and brought the following melancholy <lb/>relation which he received from the crew of the <lb/>Prudence, whom she picked up on the 1st of Ju<lb break="no"/>in lat. 22. 40. long. 85. 32. That from the <lb/>7th to the 10th of June the weather had been <lb/>very hazy, with little wind, so that Capt Addies <lb/>could not get an observation, and a strong cur<lb break="no"/>rent setting to the Southward and Westward, <lb/>drove them farther leeward than they imagined. <lb/>On the 12th, about 3 o'clock in the morning, the <lb/>watch discovered Cape Catuloh, but before intel<lb break="no"/>ligence could be given to the Captain, she struck. <lb/> For some time she made no water but about se<lb break="no"/>ven the water came in so fast, that by eleven <lb/>o'clock, A. M. the water was six feet in the <lb/>hold (the depth of the water in which she lay,) the people being sixteen in number, took to their <lb/>long boat, and endeavoured to make Cape Anto<lb break="no"/>nie; but after four days fruitless labour they <lb/>were obliged to return to the wreck, where they found two Spaniards plundering, who informed <lb/>them that there were only four inhabitants on the <lb/>island, and therefore they could receive no assist<lb break="no"/>ance from them; upon which, having taken a <lb break="no"/>quantity of beef and biscuits aboard, they left the <lb/>wreck a second time, and after having been ab<lb break="no"/>sent fourteen days, were providentially picked up <lb/>by the ship Betsey, and carried to <settlement n="4776222">Norfolk</settlement> in <lb/><region n="6254928">Virginia</region>.</p>
                <p>The Prudence was from <region n="3489940">Jamaica</region>, bound to <lb/><settlement n="2643743">London</settlement>, and had upwards of 500 hogsheads of <lb/>sugar and rum on board.</p>
