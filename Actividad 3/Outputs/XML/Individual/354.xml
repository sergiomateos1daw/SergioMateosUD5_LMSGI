                <p><pb n="5"/><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Extract of a letter from Luxene County.</hi></hi> <lb/>"On Saturday the 1st of July, I left Tioga point, <lb/>near the middle of the day; about half after one <lb/>o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising from <lb/>the north west, and I had scarcely time to take <lb/>shelter in the house of Obadiah Gore, Esq; at <lb/>Sheshequen, before the storm came on, attended <lb/>with heavy thunder and lightening, and a violent <lb/>gale of wind with rain. The storm continued up<lb break="no"/> <lb/>wards of half an hour, during which time to see <lb/>the tumbling of timber during the storm, was sur<lb break="no"/>prising. After it abated I continued on my jour<lb break="no"/>ney, but found it very difficult travelling in many <lb/>places, the road being blocked up by the falling <lb/>of timber. I reached Wilksbarree on Wednesday. <lb/>It appears that the storm extended through the <lb/>country, and at the same hour of the day, blew <lb/>more violent in some places than others. At Exe<lb break="no"/>eter, about nine miles from Wilksbarrie, a level <lb/>plain loaded with pitch pine timber, was swept of <lb/>its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile <lb/>in length, and three fourths of a mile wide, being <lb/>either torn up by the roots or twisted off, leaving <lb/>their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high.</p>
                <p>"A number of buildings in different parts of <lb/>the country stript of their roofs, and otherways <lb/>damaged–fences in many place removed, and <lb/>many fields of corn, others grain and flax laid level <lb/>with the earth–cattle killed by the falling of tim<lb break="no"/>ber in every part of the country.</p>
                <p>"A Mr. –Lot, who lived at Mahooper, <lb/>about 35 miles from Wilksbarre, whose family <lb/>consisted of his wife and a number of children– <lb/>he with his wife being absent children seeing them<lb break="no"/>selves in danger in the house, left it at the instant <lb/>a large tree was falling; the tree reached them a <lb/>small distance from the door, and a girl about e<lb break="no"/>leven years of age was crushed to pieces about expir<lb break="no"/>ed instantly. One of the other children had a <lb/>thigh and both arms broke, another badly wound<lb break="no"/>ed in the head–these two it is feared has received <lb/>the fatal blow, two other slightly wounded."</p>

                <p>"By accounts from Kentucky we are inform<lb break="no"/>ed, that about the 1st of this month a party of <lb/>Indians appeared near Frankfort, and took a great <lb/>number of horses and negroes. Col. M'Dowell with <lb/>300 men pursued them to the Ohio; but not fal<lb break="no"/>ling in with them he crossed the river, leaving 100 <lb/>men to take care of his horses; after marching <lb/>about 12 or 15 miles, overtook a large party, when <lb/>a severe engagement ensued, but being overpower<lb break="no"/>ed by numbers, was obliged to retreat. He then <lb/>sent for the men left behind, and came up with <lb/>the Indians the next day, and after engaging some <lb/>time, obliged them to make a precipitate retreat. <lb/>Col. M'Dowell took six Indian warriors, two <lb/>Englishmen and a Frenchman from Detroit, and <lb/>all the negroes and horses."</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Newtown, June</hi>  27.</hi></p>
                <p>On the 13th instant the meeting house in New<lb break="no"/>town, was removed about eight rods, the remo<lb break="no"/>val was effected in one hour and an half, after <lb/>previous preparations for the purpose had been <lb/>made. The house is between 70 and 80 feet <lb/>long, and about 50 feet wide, with a steeple at <lb/>one end; the whole of which was removed en<lb break="no"/>tire, with the least injury to any part.</p>
