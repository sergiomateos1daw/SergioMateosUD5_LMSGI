                <p><pb/>By recent letters from America we learn, that <lb/>the Congress of the nited States, after warm de<lb break="no"/>bates in both Houses, particularly in that of the <lb/>Representatives, passed an act for the purpose of <lb/>fixing permanently their seat of Government at <lb/>German Town in Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>The two new provinces in North America, <lb/>Kentucky and Vermont, whose population already <lb/>is so very considerable, were formed by the vast <lb/>numbers of inhabitants who fled from the destruc<lb break="no"/>tion and ravages of the unhappy contest between <lb/>Great Britain and her colonies, and though the <lb/>greatest part of them were then deemed loyalists, <lb/>yet they have now jooined the American confede<lb break="no"/>ration. Seated on the banks of the great river <lb/>Mississippi, far to the westward of all the other <lb/>states, they can either navigate northerly to the <lb/>lakes, or southerly to the Spanish settlements on <lb/>the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico, and carry on a <lb/>lucrative trade with the Indians. They are pos<lb break="no"/>sessed of as fertile a tract of country as any in the <lb/>world, the position of which they<supplied>???</supplied> also s<supplied>???</supplied>d <cb/>by navigable rivers to Maryland, Virginia, and <lb/>Pennsylvania, and from thence, as their views<supplied>???</supplied><lb break="no"/>tend, to every country in Europe. Thus, from <lb/>the most distressed situation, to rise to opulence <lb/>and independence ina few years, must excite ad<lb break="no"/>miration.</p>
                <p>Agriculture, at present, seems to be the pecu<lb break="no"/>liar province of American industry, from whence <lb/>wealth will flow into every part of that vast coun<lb break="no"/>try, as it abounds in large tracts of rich land, <lb/>level grounds, with a deep soil, and extended sa<lb break="no"/>vannahs; while to the northward the fisheries and <lb/>shipbuilding amply compensate for the want of <lb/>an equal fertility; and though not so abundant <lb/>in coin, yet the provinces produce the finest mea<lb break="no"/>dows, form whence a provision trade will be every <lb/>year increasing. The southern countries of Eu<lb break="no"/>rope, not affording sufficient crops of grain for <lb/>the support of their inhabitants, on account of <lb/>the remarkable encrease of population, and which <lb/>is still augmenting, as arts and manufacturers are <lb/>every where extended: America may, therefore, <lb/>be deemed, in future, the granary of this quarter <lb/>of the globe.</p>
