                <p><pb/>The brig Henry sailed from Cork on Wednes<lb break="no"/>day se'ennight, with about two hundred passen<lb break="no"/>gers for Aux Cayes, to join Sir Gregor M'Gre<lb break="no"/>gor, who lately landed on the Spanish Main with <lb/>a small force. General M'Gregor, it seems, left <lb/>authority with Colonel Eyre to recruit men for <lb/>his service, and to ship them as he best could. – <lb/>There are a number of idle gentlemen about <lb/>Dublin at present, and also many in the country, <lb/>who have been captivated with the speculation of <lb/>embarking in the Patriotic cause, and for some <lb/>time they have appeared in the streets in fanci<lb break="no"/>ful uniforms. We understand that Col. Eyre has <lb/>formed a Committee, who treat with such young <lb/>gentlemen as have the inclination to proceed on <lb/>the enterprise, and have money to pay for such <lb/>rank as they may wish to possess under M'Gre<lb break="no"/>gor. The money thus furnished is made a stock <lb/>purse to pay the freight of the vessel, and hence <lb/>it is necessary that the greater part of the adven<lb break="no"/>turers should be <hi rend="italic">officers</hi>  ; for those who are con<lb break="no"/>tented with the humble station of privates are <lb/>not required to contribute and their passage, <lb/>subsistence, &amp;c. must be defrayed by the com<lb break="no"/>mon fund. Mr D'Evereaux, from the county <lb/>of Wexford, is also raising men for the same <lb/>service, but under different circumstances. He <lb/>professes to have authority from General Bo<lb break="no"/> <lb/>livar to grant commissions, and to ship the men <lb/>he may raise for head-quarters in Venezuela. Mr <lb/>D'Evereaux has not yet dispatched any men, and <lb/>Col. Eyre has certainly shewn more activity in <lb/>this respect. – <hi rend="italic">Dublin Journal</hi>.</p>
