                <p><pb/>Advice from Charlestown, South Carolina, <lb/>says that the Indians in Washington county com<lb break="no"/>mit the most horrid depredations and cruelties. <lb/>They have set fire to several houses; and a wo<lb break="no"/>man, who had a sick husband, telling them from <lb/>a window, of her calamity, they shot her dead on <lb/>the spot, and then set fire to the spot. The sick <lb/>man was consequently burnt.</p>
                <p>A Colonel Harling has greatly exerted and <lb/>distinguished himself in opposing the Indians on <lb/>a part of the American frontiers. This gentle<lb break="no"/>man, with two hundred men, even went into the <lb/>very heart of an Indian settlement, and defeated <lb/>the savages. He then penetrated the country, <lb/>destroying all before him, and returned without <lb/>the loss of a man. Every possible acknowledge<lb break="no"/>ment was made of his services and bravery, and <lb/>a liberal subscription made for his gallant little <lb/>army.</p>
