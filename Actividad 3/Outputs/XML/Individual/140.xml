                <p>Some Canada papers to the 11th let. have arrived in <lb/>town. Sir Peregrine Maitland had summoned the <lb/>Parliament of Upper Canada to meet him at York, on <lb/>the 22d of April. He had appointed Port Talbot in <lb/>the town of Dunwich, a port of entry, in the same <lb/>manner as those established between Canada and the <lb/>United Statess.</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter to a Gentleman in George-town, <lb/>dated Tobago, Feb. 9. 1819.–' The heavy rains <lb/>which continued during the months of December and <lb/>January, almost inundated the country, which brought <lb/>on a most rapid and fatal disease, which made its first <lb/>appearance in the frost, at a short distance from the <lb/>town, consisting of 212 men strong, and in 10 or 12 <lb/>days, 45 of that number were numbered with the dead. <lb/>The contagion was so rapid, that it soon spread into <lb/>the town, shipping, and country, and proved equally <lb/>fatal. The disorder was such, it baffled all medical <lb/>aid. The alarming symptoms were such, that business <lb/>was nearly suspended–the white population seeking <lb/>safety in other islands, or in the remote and healthiest <lb/>part of this. I assure you, that every thing had a <lb/>most gloomy appearance ; and the disease was so con<lb break="no"/>tagious, one man would hardly venture to touch ano<lb break="no"/>ther. The William's crew, from their mutinous dis<lb break="no"/>position, deserted her–some have since died ; and <lb/>some remain sick. The weather has become good <lb/>within these fifteen days, and the health of the island <lb/>improving fast.'</p>
                <p>A series of Sierra Leone Gazettes, to the 20th of <lb/>February, have reached us. They contain no intelli<lb break="no"/>gence of particular interest, expect that the colony ap<lb break="no"/>pears to have been healthy at that period. In one of <lb/>them we find a contradiction of the reports which <lb/>found their way into the English papers some months <lb/>since of the dreadful mortality that prevailed in that <lb/>settlement. It states that the "total number of Euro<lb break="no"/>peans who died in the Peninsula in 1818, was eight <lb/>men, three women, and two children. We lost no ci<lb break="no"/>vil, military or colonial officer, excepting one young <lb/>Gentleman who died a month after his arrival, and is <lb/>included in the number."</p>
                <p>A letter from the Havannah, dated 27th February, <lb/>mentions that the article of coffee is gradually rising <lb/>in value, and that an agent from Messrs Baring is <lb/>making purchases there to the amount of 1/3 a million <lb/>sterling, in that single commodity.</p>
