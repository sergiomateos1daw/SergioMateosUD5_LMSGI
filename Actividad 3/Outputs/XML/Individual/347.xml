                <p><hi rend="italic">Extract of a letter from a Gentleman at Kentucky,  <lb/>to a Member of the General Assembly, dated,  <lb/>Nov</hi>. 7, 1790.</p>
                <p>"I have been waiting with much impatience <lb/>to obtain some certain account of our troops; <lb/>many probably conjectures still fill the minds of the <lb/>people. A hand-bill just come to Bourbon, con<lb break="no"/>tains an extract of a letter from Governor St. <cb/>Clair to General Wilkinson, which mentions that <lb/>our army had met with but little opposition. The <lb/>Miami villages were abandoned, from thence a <lb/>detachment was sent up to St. Joseph's river, <lb/>which fell in with a party of Indians, and had a <lb/>severe engagement.</p>
                <p>"General Harmar made a shew of retreating, <lb/>and marched about eight miles, when he detached <lb/>a strong party to the field of action, in hopes of <lb/>finding the Indians on the ground; as they ex<lb break="no"/>pected, so they found them, and an action imme<lb break="no"/>diately commenced, which was obstinate on both <lb/>sides.</p>
                <p>"A vast number of Indians were killed in <lb/>crossing the St. Joseph's river. Major Fountain, <lb/>of Fayette, and General Scott's son were killed <lb/>the second fire; Capt. M'Murty and 73 militia<lb break="no"/>men were killed; Major Willis, Lieut. Fother<lb break="no"/>ingham, of the Fâ€“deral troops, and 77 privates, <lb/>also fell in the action.</p>
                <p>"General Harmar did not send a single man <lb/>to reinforce the detachment, consisting of 400 <lb/>men, (who had to sustain the fire of the whole <lb/>Indian army) although he had with him in camp <lb/>upwards of 1100 men. Our men at last lost <lb/>ground, Colonel Harding's wing was beaten, and <lb/>finally broke. Lieutenant Colonel Hall, of Bour<lb break="no"/>bon, and Majors M'Million and Willis broke the <lb/>other wing of the Indians, which occasioned the <lb/>amazing slaughter in the river St. Joseph.</p>
                <p>"General Harmar never sent to bring off the <lb/>wounded, nor bury the dead. Captain David <lb/>Thrope and Lieut. Clark fell in the field. The <lb/>Bourbon militia has suffered very much, nearly <lb/>one third of them having fallen on the spot.</p>
                <p>"The army is now at Licking, and is ex<lb break="no"/>pected home hourly.</p>
                <p>"This is the best account that I have been <lb/>able to collect; it will be delivered to you by <lb/>Major Jones, who before he leaves the district, <lb/>may be enabled to obtain further particulars."</p>
