                <p><pb n="6"/> The West India merchants, who were in the <lb/>utmost anxiety for the arrival of the packet from <lb/>the West Indies, have been most agreebly relie<lb break="no"/>ed from their apprehensions. The account of the <lb/>insurrections in Martinique, which we received <lb/>through France, and which has been since con<lb break="no"/>firmed in the National Assembly, naturally alarm<lb break="no"/>ed them for the British islands. We are happy <lb/>to inform our readers, that the packet brings no <lb/>intelligence whatever of tumult of insurrections. <lb/>We have not heard even that the letters bring <lb/>any account of the conspiracy in Martinique ; a <lb/>circumstance which can only be accounted for by <lb/>the little communication which exists between the <lb/>islands at this season of the year."</p>
