The nation to whom the Indian be<lb break="no"/>longed, being made acquainted with the murder, <lb/>sent a deputation to the Governor, demanding <lb/>that five Spaniards should be instantly delivered <lb/>up as an attonement. This was peremptorily re<lb break="no"/>fused, as being more than commensurate to the <lb/>offence, but the murderer was offered as a satis<lb break="no"/>faction; the Indians would not accept him singly, <lb/>and departed, vowing the severest revenge: a <lb/>few days afterwards intelligence was received that <lb/>they had surprised and massacred sixteen men, <lb/>who had been at work in the woods; and when <lb/>the vessel departed, the Spaniards were flying, <lb/>with the utmost precipitation and terror, from <lb/>all parts of the country, seeking shelter in the <lb/>forts.</p>
