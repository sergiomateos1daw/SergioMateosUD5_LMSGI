                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">New South Wales</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Grote</hi>  rose to move a series of resolutions in con<lb break="no"/> <lb/>demnation of the application of a part of the Land and Emi<lb break="no"/>gration Fund of New South Wales to the maintenance of <lb/>gaols and police in that colony. It was in 1831 that this ex<lb break="no"/>pense, antecedently borne by the Home Government, was <lb/>for the first time thrown upon the colony, whose revenues <lb/>were then found to yield considerable surplus of revenue <lb/>beyond expenditure. The charge so imposed at that time was <lb/>calculated to be about t25,000 a year ; and had that been all <lb/>the colony would have borne it without a murmur; but in <lb/>fact it had ever since averaged nearly t60,000. It was not <lb/>reasonable to impose such a charge on the colony, on account <lb/>of gaols and police, constituted not the ordinary uses of <lb/>a colonial society, but for the peculiar purposes of our trans<lb break="no"/>portation system. The argument urged by the Home Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was, that the expense was chiefly caused by the extensive <lb/>distribution of convicts by assignment throughout the colony, <lb/>whose settlers drew a proportional profit from the labour so <lb/>assigned. But that assignment was a gain, not more to the <lb/>colonists, who obtained the labour, than to the mother country, <lb/>which saved the expense of maintaing the labourers. What<lb break="no"/>ever value the mother country might be entitled to claim <lb/>for the labour of the convicts, ought in strictness to fall, not <lb/>on the colony at large, but on the individual employers; and <lb/>if there were valid reasons against an exaction of premium <lb/>from them, still it was unjust to throw the obligation upon <lb/>the colony at large. That was to pay private wages out of <lb/>public rates. This one charge on the oclony was sufficient <lb/>on account for all that embarassment in its finances which <lb/>had been growing for the last six years. It had been enabled <lb/>to defray the impact, only by resorting to the emigra<lb break="no"/>tion fund, and thus checking emigration itself. No <lb/>less than t260,000 had been abstracted from that fund to <lb/>meet these costs of jails and police. The diversion of that <lb/>fund from emigration was a great evil, both to the colony, <lb/>where labour is so pressingly needed, and to the poor of this <lb/>country, to whom that refuge is so material. He considered <lb/>the emigration fund as held by the Government in trust for <lb/>the united intersts of the colony and of the mother country. <lb/>The great extent of sales of land in the colony had been <lb/>[?] owing to the belief of the colonists that the proceed<lb break="no"/>[?] would be applied to emigration.</p>
                <p>The hon. member was proceeding to cite the opinions of <lb/>various persons in favour of this strict application, when a mo<lb break="no"/>tion was made to count the House, and it adjourned for want <lb/>of its quorum[?] of 40 members.</p>
