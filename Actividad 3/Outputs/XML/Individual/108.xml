                <p>The Rota frigate arrived on Monday off Ply<lb break="no"/>mouth, with a fleet from Halifax under convoy, and <lb/>passed up the channel with the chief part of the trade. <lb/>From the Hydra transport, which put into Plymouth, <lb/>we have received the following official notification of <lb/>Sir James Yeo's success on Lake Ontario, the Ame<lb break="no"/>rican notices of which have already been published.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bulletin.</hi></p>
                <p>"Head-quarters Kingston, Aug. 14. 1813 <lb/>"By accounts received from his Excellency the <lb/>Governor in Chief and Commander of the forces, <lb/>from Commodore Sir James Yeo, dated off York, <lb/>half-past one P.M. on the 11th instant, the following <lb/>particulars have been transmitted of the capture and <lb/>loss of the enemy's armed schooners:–</p>
                <p>"On Thursday evening last, the 10th instant, <lb/>the enemy's squadron, under the Command of Com<lb break="no"/>modore Chauncey, got under weigh from their an<lb break="no"/>chorage, off the mouth of Niagara River, and, with <lb/>a fine breeze from the east, stood towards our fleet, <lb/>which were becalmed off the port of Twelve Mile <lb/>Creek. At sun-set, a breeze coming off the land, <lb/>gave us the wind of the enemy, when our squadron <lb/>stood for them, on which immediately bore away <lb/>from us under as much sail as their schooners could <lb/>carry to keep up with their larger vessels. The enemy's <lb/>fleet formed a long. The Pike, Madison, Oneida, <lb/>and six schooners (two schooners were placed to <lb/>windward for the purpose of raking the masts of our <lb/>squadron as it should come up). At eleven the <lb/>squadron got within gun-shot of the schooners, <lb/>when they opened a brisk fire, and, from their <lb/>going so fast, it was more than an hour before the <lb/>Wolf, our headmost ship, could pass them ; at <lb/>this time the rest of the squadron was two and <lb/>three miles astern of the Wolf, and on her coming <lb/>up with the Madison and Pike, they put before <lb/>the wind and made sail, firing their stern-chasers.– <lb/>Sir J. Yeo finding it impossible to get the squa<lb break="no"/>dron up with the enemy, as the Wolf was the only <lb/>ship which could keep up with them, then made <lb/>sail between them and the two schooners to wind<lb break="no"/>ward, which he captured, and which are called <lb/>the Julia and Growler, each carrying one long 32<lb break="no"/>pounder and long 12-pounder, and 40 men.– <lb/>Two of the enemy's largest schooners, the Scourge, <lb/>of 10, and Hamilton, of nine guns, upset on the <lb/>night of the 9th, in carrying sail, and all on board <lb/>perished (about 100 in number). By this loss and <lb/>capture, the enemy's squadron are reduced to 10 <lb/>vessels, and our's increased to eight. It is ascer<lb break="no"/>tained that the Pike mounts 28 long 24-pounders, <lb/>and 420 men, the Madison 22 long 32 pounders, <lb/>and 340 men. Boat loads of troops were taken on <lb/>board the enemy's squadron on Monday last, for the <lb/>purpose, it is supposed, of repelling the boarders.– <lb/>The Wolf has not received any material injury, and <lb/>not a person hurt. The prisoners were landed on <lb/>the 11th instant, and the Growler's damage repair<lb break="no"/>ed. She had lost her bowsprit, and was otherwise <lb/>cut up.</p>
                <p>"Nothing could exceed the eagerness and enthu<lb break="no"/>siasm of the officers and men in our squadron for a <lb/>close engagement."</p>
