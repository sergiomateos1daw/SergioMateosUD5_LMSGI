                <p>"We sincerely hope that the Duties Government had in con<lb break="no"/>templation (last year) to impose upon Timber imported into <lb/>Great Britain and Ireland, from the British North American <lb/>Provinces, equal to the additional duty imposed on Foreign <lb/>Timber in 1813 will be further suspended.</p>
                <p>"Our[?] commercial system chiefly depends upon the encourage<lb break="no"/>ment of the Timber branch ; ships that carry away that article[?] <lb/>bring us [?] at a low freight, whereby we are enabled to furnish <lb/>the British West India Islands with an abundant supply of Fish[?], <lb/>and that on very moderate terms ; but, in the event of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment persisting in imposing the Duty on Timber from hence, <lb/>that branch of our trade will inevitably revert to the Americans, <lb/>besides being the ruin of many in this and in the neighbouring <lb/>Provinces.</p>
                <p>"The supposed revenue that would accrue to the mother <lb/>country, upon trial, will be found delusive ; to prove this, many <lb/>obvious[?] reasons can be adduced : As the trade now exists, all the <lb/>Timber extracted from these Colonies to Great Britain and Ire<lb break="no"/>land is paid for in British Manufactures ; the export of so bulky <lb/>an article as Timber, and the import of so ponderous an article <lb/>as [?], employs[?] an immense number of British ships ; objects <lb/>certainly of more real value to the revenue of Britain than any <lb/>benefit they could possibly derive from direct Duties imposed on <lb/>the export of Timber from British North America. It cannot be <lb/>denied that previous to 1813, when the additional Duty was laid <lb/>on Foreign Timber, they (the Foreigners) were not only the <lb/>carriers, but would not accept an ounce of British Manufac<lb break="no"/>ture in payment for their TImber–no, nothing but you gold[?] <lb/>which was so much in demand, that 28s. was given for a [?]. <lb/>Another very cogent reason [?] be advanced in favour of what <lb/>is commonly denominated the Timber Trade from these Provin<lb break="no"/>ces ; it facilitates emigration, and introduces many valuable set<lb break="no"/>tlers into this Province, and the Canadas, that would go to the <lb/>States of America ; and the day is perhaps not so far distant when <lb/>they would of accessity[?] become our enemies.</p>
                <p>"When Great Britain was first involved in war with the eas<lb break="no"/>tern countries, from whence the principal supply of Timber was <lb/>derived, the merchants in that line[?], as well as the ship-masters <lb/>were not only alarmed, but convinced themselves ruined ! The <lb/>Baltic is shut[?], what shall we do for Timber, and with our ships? <lb/>They properly concluded that perhaps the British Provinces could <lb/>supply them ; they made the experiment, they were not disap<lb break="no"/>pointed–but succeeded far beyond their expectations. If there<lb break="no"/>fore, in time of war, Britain has took to her colonies for a sup<lb break="no"/>ply of such a necessary article as Wood ; it is not reasonable for <lb/>us to conclude that their interests will not be wholly neglected, <lb/>when blessed with peace."</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Extract of a Letter, dated Savannah, 25th Nov.</hi>  1817</p>
                <p>"In the Southern States, this autumn has been the most fa<lb break="no"/>tal they have experienced since their colonization. Many thou<lb break="no"/>sands have been hurried off to that " narrow house" destined <lb/>for all that live. A most malignant fever has prevailed to an <lb/>alarming extent. In this city, during the last four months, the <lb/>deaths have been equal to one-eights of the inhabitants left in <lb/>it ; and in Beaufort (S. Carolina) and in some of the Southern <lb/>Counties, the morality has exceeded one-sixth!"</p>
