                <p>Our humanity was deeply affected by the dread<lb break="no"/>ful carnage made by the Indians. You may be <lb/>assured that the number of Indians did not exceed <lb/>1000, and that nothing saved General St. Clair, <lb/>and the remainder of his army, but the great quan<lb break="no"/>tity of plunder he left to the Indians; they were <lb/>composed of various tribes, and three-fourths of <lb/>of them remained in the camp to plunder it, and to <lb/>take scalps, the trophies of their victory; and he <lb/>that got most when he returned to his nation, ac<lb break="no"/>quired the greatest share of glory; hence only a<lb break="no"/>bout 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is un<lb break="no"/>der 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they <lb/>have obtained at so easy a purchase, and the riches <lb/>they obtained by the plunder, and the provisions <lb/>they found, will make them a more terrible foe <lb/>than ever they have been; they boast of taking an <lb/>amazing quantity of powder and arms, which they <lb/>wanted; many of them were only armed with <lb/>spears and hatchets, and I have no doubt but if a<lb break="no"/>nother expedition should be set on foot, that they <lb/>will be met by three times the number of Indians. <lb/>The indian tribes of nations who live many hun<lb break="no"/>dred miles back have all entered into an association, <lb/>and made the present war a common concern, they <lb/>to oppose what they call the common enemy. The <lb/>warriors of the different tribes so united are not <lb/>less than 15 or 20,000; numbers of the chiefs of <lb/>ten or twelve numerous nations were here last sum<lb break="no"/>mer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make <lb/>peace, and offered his mediations; he told them he <lb/>was at peace with the United States, and could <lb/>give them no assistance. Their answer was, that <lb/>the enemy was in their country, and would not <lb/>make peace with them, but on term dishonourable, <lb/>and at the expense of their country, and that they <lb/>had determined to die before they would accept of <lb/>such terms. They felt much dissatisfied with the <lb/>answer they received, and departed with a full de<lb break="no"/>termination to defend their country with the last <lb/>of their blood.</p>
                <p>You may depend on it, that many years will e<lb break="no"/>lapse, and many thousand men be expended before <lb/>the United States will, by the present measures, <lb/>be able to possess the country in contest; and I <lb/>may also add, that I have great apprehensions, that <cb/>desolation and destruction will be the consequence <lb/>on the frontiers of the Ohio this winter and next <lb/>spring; I would to God some steps might be tak<lb break="no"/>en to prevent them. I have no doubt the coun<lb break="no"/>try might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the <lb/>expence already incurred by the different expedi<lb break="no"/>tions; the attempt to take the country from them <lb/>by force, is founded in unrighteousness, and ought <lb/>to be abandoned; besides, if the American mean <lb/>to have anytrade with them, they are taking steps <lb/>that will prevent it for many years to come. The <lb/>Indians do not easily forget or forgive injuries</p>

                <p>By the Pittsburgh post which arrived yesterday, <lb/>we are informed, that previous to his leaving Pitts<lb break="no"/>burgh, an express had arrived there with the me<lb break="no"/>lancholy news that Forts Jefferson and Franklin <lb/>were taken by Indians, and that two large bo<lb break="no"/>dies of them were moving to the Allighany.</p>

                <p>"Last Sunday evening came to this town a <lb/>young man from Cat-fish, which he left about two <lb/>weeks ago, and who gave us the following pleasing <lb/>interesting, and important intelligence, viz, that <lb/>two days before he left Cat-fish, two men arrived <lb/>there from Licking, who informed, that they had <lb/>been out with a body of 1300 volunteers on horse<lb break="no"/>back from Kentucky, under General Scott; that <lb/>they left Licking on the expedition a few days be<lb break="no"/>fore Christmas; that General Scott dispatched <lb/>three spies in advance, who, when they arrived a<lb break="no"/>bout 13 miles beyond the spot where General St. <lb/>Clair was defeated they discovered a large body of <lb/>Indians diverting and enjoying themselves with the <lb/>plunder they had taken, riding the bullocks, dan<lb break="no"/>cing, &amp;c. and appeared to be mostly drunk; that <lb/>on the information being given to General Scott, <lb/>who, with the main body, were a few miles in the <lb/>rear, he divided them into three divisions, advan<lb break="no"/>ced, and fell on the enemy by surprise; that the <lb/>contest was short, but victorious, on the side of the <lb/>volunteers, 700 of the enemy being killed on the <lb/>spot, all the cannon and stores in their possession <lb/>retaken, and the remainder of that savage body put <lb/>to flight; that General Scott, having lost but six <lb/>men, returned to Licking in triumph, with most <lb/>of the cattle, stores, &amp;c. leaving the cannon at <lb/>Fort Jefferson; that General Scott had previous<lb break="no"/>ly gone out with 400 men, but finding his num<lb break="no"/>ber was insufficient, was returning but met a body <lb/>of 900 volunteers when, upon joining him, he im<lb break="no"/>mediately proceeded in prosecution of his original <lb/>design which fortunately proved successful.</p>
                <p>"Our informant further adds, that he saw a <lb/>Kentucky newspaper of the 8th of January, at <lb/>Morgan Town, brought by Major Scott's expedi<lb break="no"/>tion, which corresponded with that given by the <lb/>two men at Cat Fish, and that Gen. Scott brought <lb/>in near 700 scalps."</p>
