                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Canada  <lb/>Lord Selkirk</hi></p>
                <p>We have been favoured by a Gentleman in this city, with the <lb/>following interesting and authentic communication, on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of the dispute between Lord Selkirk, and the Gentlemen of <lb/>the North West Company:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Extract of a Letter from Montreal, dated 6th October, </hi><lb/>1816.</p>
                <p>"In the newspapers which I sent you, you will see some <lb/>accounts of the disturbances which have taken place in the North <lb/>West between the North West Company and Lord Selkirk's co<lb break="no"/>lonists. The latter have been obliged to leave the Red River, <lb/>after having had 22 of their men, including Governor Semple, <lb/>killed by a party of <hi rend="italic">half-breeds,</hi>  the spurious offspring of the <lb/>North West Company. As yet have not had an accurate <lb/>statement of that melancholy transaction. Lord Selkirk's party <lb/>state that these half-breed with some of the North West Com<lb break="no"/> <lb/>pany servants, came to destroy the settlement, and that Mr <lb/>Semple, with about 25 of the Colonists, went out to meet them, <lb/>to know what could be their intentions, when those rascals com<lb break="no"/>menced firing on them, and massacred all but three, who were for<lb break="no"/>tunate enough to make their escape. The North West people's <lb/>account is that these <hi rend="italic">half-breeds</hi>  with some <hi rend="italic">Indians</hi>  were bring<lb break="no"/>ing down provisions from the upper part of the Red River to the <lb/>entrance near Lake Winipie, and as the Colonists had the com<lb break="no"/>mand of a great part of the river, they were obliged to pass in the <lb/>rear of the settlement, which being observed by Governor Sem<lb break="no"/>ple, who was on the look-out for them, he settled out of his Fort <lb/>with 25 men and a [?]-piece to take from the Indians the pro<lb break="no"/>visions which were intended for the North West Company ; that <lb/>the result[?] was an engagement which terminated in the defeat of <lb/>the Colonists, of whom twenty-two were killed. Lord Selkirk <lb/>[?] from Montreal for the Red River about the latter end of <lb/>June, when[?] three or four officers and about 150 men of De Men<lb break="no"/>[?]'s regiment, which had been disbanded, and when he arrived <lb/>at Fort William on Lake Superior, hearing the fate of his Colon<lb break="no"/>ists, he[?] immediately issued a warrant against Mr M'Gillivray for <lb/>high treason, conspiracy and murder, and subsequently warrants a<lb break="no"/>gainst all the partners of the N. W. Company, who were at F Wil<lb break="no"/>liam, [?] formal possession of their establishment there, and sent <lb/>Mr M'Gillivray, with about ten others, prisoners to Montreal, with <lb/>all their papers [?] a number of packs of Beaver and other Furs, <lb/>and several bales[?] of Merchandise, which he found in possession of <lb/>the North West Company, belonging to the Hudson's Bay Com<lb break="no"/>pany. The Police Officers in Montreal were several days exa<lb break="no"/>mining the papers, and about four or five days after the arrival of <lb/>Mr M'Gillivray and the others, they were admitted to bail, to ap<lb break="no"/>pear to take their trial at the next criminal court, or any court of <lb/>Oyer and Terminer which may be appointed. Stuart (the ci-de<lb break="no"/> vant Solicitor-General, who was dismissed by Sir James Craig, <lb/>and at whose instance an ineffectual attempt was lately made by <lb/>some misguided members of our House of Assembly to impeach <lb/>Chief Justices Sewell and Monk) is one of Lord Selkirk's coun<lb break="no"/>sel and spoke at great length, and what his friends and admi<lb break="no"/>rers call very eloquently, strongly opposed their being admitted <lb/>to bail, but all would not do, and they were accordingly bailed ; <lb/>Mr M'Gillivray in sureties of t1000 and the others in t500, <lb/>sums inconsiderable enough, advering to the high crimes and <lb/>misdemeanours with which they were charged.</p>
                <p>"In the <hi rend="italic">Montreal Herald</hi>  you will see a very learned, and (as <lb/>our neighbour Jonathan would say) a <hi rend="italic">lengthy</hi>  communication, <lb/>signed <hi rend="italic">Montius[?]</hi>, setting forth the rights which the Hudson's <lb/>Bay Company by their charter possess over the Countries which <lb/>they have granted to Lord Selkirk, and the power vested in him <lb/>of appointing Governors and other Officers to superintend and <lb/>regulate the Colony. Being a masterly production, it will no <lb/>doubt makes its appearance in a pamphlet, and when it does, I <lb/>shall send you one, in case the papers should miscarry. It is un<lb break="no"/>certain whether the Earl will remain in the North West during <lb/>the winter, or come down to Montreal ; if the latter, he must be <lb/>down[?] soon[?], as the season for water-travelling will shortly close.</p>
                <p>"Montreal is now divided into two parties, one favouring the <lb/>Lord, and the other the North West Company ; and with the ex<lb break="no"/>ception of the friends of the latter, strongly in favour of his <lb/>Lordship."</p>
