                <p>"This day week the most diabolical design that <lb/>that ever was formed, was discovered in Martinico : It <lb/>was an insurrection of the negroes, who were that <lb/>night to have set fire to the large and beautiful <lb/>town of St. Pierre ; while the white people were <lb/>all in confusion, and striving to escape the flames, <lb/>they were to be butchered indiscriminately, man <lb/>woman, and child.â€“The combustibles were laid <lb/>in upwards of 100 houses, consisting of hemp dip<lb break="no"/>ped in turpentine. The plot was not discovered <lb/>till five o'clock in the evening, when a negro be<lb break="no"/>longing to an old lady, stung with remorse on <lb/>thinking that he must murder the woman who <lb/>brought him up form a child, disclosed it to her. <lb/>The Troops being thereupon assembled, 40 of the <lb/>negroes were taken, armed with a hanger and a <lb/>long knife, the insturments which were in a few <lb/>hours to have put a period to the existence of up<lb break="no"/>wards of 5000 people. All the inhabitants have <lb/>been under arms ever since, as they are afraid the <lb/>negroes will attemp to release the 40 who are in <lb/>gaol."</p>
