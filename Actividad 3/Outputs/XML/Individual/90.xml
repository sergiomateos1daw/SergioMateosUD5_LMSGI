                <p><pb n="3"/> CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.</p>
                <p>The following account of the inhabitants of this <lb/>settlement is given by a late traveller.</p>
                <p>The education of youth has hitherto been very <lb/>much neglected: the government never hit upon any <lb/>successful plan for the establishment of public schools; <cb/>and the individual had no other ambition but that of <lb/>qualifying his sons, by writing and accounts, to be<lb break="no"/>come servants of the Company. This body of mer<lb break="no"/>chants had a number of persons in their employ, <lb/>who were very ill paid. Their salaries, indeed, were <lb/>sufficient to afford them a bare subsistence ; but it ta<lb break="no"/> <lb/>citly allowed them to negotiate for themselves: the <lb/>consequence of such a conduct was, that each be<lb break="no"/>came a kind of petty dealer. Each had his little pri<lb break="no"/>vate shop in some corner of his house. The most pal<lb break="no"/>try articles were in the list of their commodities for <lb/>sale ; and those who ranked high in government, <lb/>and assumed a string of full-founding epithets to <lb/>their names, felt no sore of indignity in retailing the <lb/>produce of their gardens ; not indeed, avowedly, but <lb/>through the medium of their slaves. In fact, the minds <lb/>of every class, the Governor, the Clergy, the F[?]l, <lb/>and the Secretary of the Court of Justice excepted, <lb/>were wholly bent on trade. <hi rend="italic">Knopman</hi>, or merchant, <lb/>was a title that conferred rank at the Cape, to which <lb/>the military even aspired. On this subject the ideas <lb/>of the Dutch differ widely from those of the Chi<lb break="no"/>nese, who have degraded the merchant into the <lb/>very lowest order of their society.</p>
                <p>That portion of the day, not employed in the <lb/>concerns of trade, is usually devoted to the grati<lb break="no"/>fication of the sensual appetite. Few have any taste <lb/>for reading, and none for the cultivation of the fine <lb/>arts.â€“They have no kind of public amusements, <lb/>except occasional balls ; nor is there much social <lb/>intercourse but by family parties; which usually <lb/>consist of card playing or dancing. Money-mat<lb break="no"/>ters and merchandize engross their whole conver<lb break="no"/>sation : yet none are opulent, though many in easy <lb/>circumstances. There are no beggars in the whole <lb/>colony, and but a few who are objects of public cha<lb break="no"/> <lb/>rity. The subsistence for these is derived from the <lb/>interest of a fund established out of the church su<lb break="no"/>perfluities, from alms, donations, and collections, <lb/>made after divine service, and not from any tax laid <lb/>upon the public. Except, indeed, a few colonial <lb/>assessments for the repairs of the streets and public <lb/>works, the inhabitants of the Cape have little <lb/>drawback on their profits, on the produce of their <lb/>labour.</p>
                <p>It has been the remark of most travellers, that <lb/>the ladies of the Cape are pretty, lively, and good <lb/>humoured ; possessing little of that phlegmatic tem<lb break="no"/>per which is a principal trait in the national charac<lb break="no"/>ter of the Dutch. The difference in the manners <lb/>and appearance of the young men and the young <lb/>women, in the same family, is inconceivably great. <lb/>The former are clumsy in their shape, awkward in <lb/>in their carriage, and of an unsocial disposition; <lb/>whilst the latter are generally of a small, delicate <lb/>form, below the middle size, of easy and unaffected <lb/>manners, well dressed, and fond of social intercourse; <lb/>an indulgence in which they are seldom restrained <lb/>by their parents, and which they as seldom turn to <lb/>abuse. They are here indeed less dependent on, <lb/>and less subject to, the caprice of parents than else <lb/>where. Primogeniture entitles to no advantage; <lb/>but all the children, male and female, share alike <lb/>in the family property. No parent can disinherit a <lb/>child without assigning, on proof, on at least of <lb/>the fourteen reasons enumerated in the Justinian <lb/>Code.</p>
                <p>By the law of the colony, a community of all <lb/>property, both real and personal, is supposed to take <lb/>place on the marriage of two person unless the <lb/>contrary should be particularly provided against by <lb/>solemn contract made before marriage. Where no <lb/>such contract exists, the children, on the death of <lb/>either parent, are entitled to that half of the joint <lb/>property, which was supposed to belong to the de<lb break="no"/>ceased, and which cannot be withheld on applica<lb break="no"/>tion after they are come of age.</p>
                <p>It is but justice to the young females of the Cape <lb/>to r emark, that many of them have profited much <lb/>more than could be expected from the limited <lb/>means of education that the place affords. In the <lb/>better families, most of them are taught music, and <lb/>some have acquired a tolerable degree of execution. <lb/>Many understand the French language, and some <lb/>have made great proficiency in the English. They <pb n="4"/> are expert at the needle, and all kinds of lace, knot<lb break="no"/>ting, and tambour work, and in general make up <lb/>their own dresses, following the prevailing fashion <lb/>of England brought from time to time by the female <lb/>passengers bound to India, from whom they may <lb/>be said to <lb/><hi rend="center">"Catch the manners living as they rise"</hi></p>
                <p>Neither are the other sex, while boys, deficient <lb/>in vivacity or talent ; but, for want of the means of <lb/>a proper education, to open their minds, and excite <lb/>in them a desire of knowledge, they soon degene<lb break="no"/>rate into the common routine of eating, smoaking [sic], <lb/>and sleeping. Few of the male inhabitants associate <lb/>with the English, except such as hold employments <lb/>under the Government. This backwardness may <lb/>be said to be owing in part to the different habits of <lb/>the two nations, and partly, perhaps, to the reluc<lb break="no"/>tance that a vanquished people must always feel in <lb/>mixing with their conquerors.</p>
