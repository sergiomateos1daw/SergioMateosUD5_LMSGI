                <p>The red bugs, which did so much injury to the <lb/>cotton last year, have again made their appear<lb break="no"/>ance, but not in such numbers as was first ex<lb break="no"/>pected.</p>
                <p>The hops in many States of America have been <lb/>particularly productive.</p>
                <p>A letter from Great-Ogreechee, in Georgia, <lb/>dated December 9th, says, "since the comple<lb break="no"/>tion of the treaty with the Creeks, all has been <lb/>very quiet, unless we except some ill-natured state - <lb/>bickerings and heart-burning amongst ourselves, <lb/>chiefly occasioned by a few influential men, who <lb/>find themselves great losers by a general act of <lb/>common justice towards the Indians. These, <lb/>however, we expect, will subside by degrees; not<lb break="no"/>withstanding the formidable combination in a cer<lb break="no"/>tain part of the State. As to the Creeks, Simi<lb break="no"/>noles, and other nations adjoining our Western <lb/>frontier, nothing is clearer than that, so far from <lb/>being injurious to us, they may henceforward be <lb/>made useful to the real interests of this State, pro<lb break="no"/>vided the faith of treaties be observed. They now <lb/>show every disposition to copy our manners, arts, <lb/>agriculture, and mode of living.</p>
