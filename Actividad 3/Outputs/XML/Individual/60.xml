                <p>Saturday, between the hours of two and <lb/>three, arrived in town from New-York, the <lb/>PRESIDENT of the United States.</p>
                <p> <lb/>The inhabitants of this metropolis have now <lb/>the happiness to felicitate themselves on having <lb/>among them the virtuous General, who delivered <lb/>their capital from the oppression of a British foe; <lb/>and in the same person the magnanimous Presi<lb break="no"/>dent of the United States of America.–The <lb/>President left New-York on Thursday the 15th <lb/>instant, to visit the Eastern States, attended ou<lb break="no"/>ly by his two private secretaries and servants– <lb/>Actuated by the principles of a true republican Pa<lb break="no"/>triot, and considing in the ardent affections of <lb/>the citizens in the States through which he had <lb/>to pass, he had it in vic<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> travel without the</p>
                <p> <cb/>temporary parade which his dignified station might <lb/>justly clam but wherever he came his merits were <lb/>already known, and the people, with heartfelt joy, <lb/>and high approbation of his virtues, saluted him <lb/>the Defender of their Freedom and Independence. <lb/>–The worthy Governor of this Commonwealth <lb/>haivng an exalted estimation of the virtuous Pre<lb break="no"/>sident, and although much indisposed as to his <lb/>health, was determined to shew the President the <lb/>honours of the government in a stile suitable to <lb/>his dignity; accordingly he ordered the troops of <lb/>Middlesex horse to escort him through that coun<lb break="no"/>ty, and permitted General brooks to exhibit to <lb/>the President on Cambridge Common, as he pas<lb break="no"/>sed, a fine body of the militia of the 3d division, <lb/>consisting of about 1000 men, all in complete u<lb break="no"/>niform and equipment. The President was ho<lb break="no"/>noured with a salute as he passed them. The <lb/>Governor requested the Lieutenant Governor and <lb/>the Council, to meet the President at Cambridge <lb/>(and would have accompanied them himself hand <lb/>his health permitted) whither they were escorted <lb/>by col. Tyler's corps of the horse. The Lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant governor and Council met him there, and <lb/>preceded the President under the escort of horse, <lb/>and introduced him to the capital of the common<lb break="no"/>wealth.</p>
                <p>From the best accounts we are able to collect, <lb/>we present the following as the</p>

                <p>On the President's arrival at the State-house, <lb/>he ascended a temporary balcony, adjoining the <lb/>gallery, where were a select choir of singers, who, <lb/>upon the President's appearance, sang the follow<lb break="no"/>ing</p>
                <p> <lb/><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">ODE to Columbia's Favourite SON.</hi></hi> <lb/><hi rend="center">1. </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Great Washington</hi>, The Hero's come, <lb/>Each heart exulting hearts the sound, <lb/>Thousands to their Deliverer throng, <lb/>And shout him welcome all around! <lb/>Now its full chorus join the songs, <lb/>And shout aloud great <hi rend="smallcaps">Washington</hi>.</p>

                <p><hi rend="center">4. </hi><lb/>'Twas on your plains they valour rose, <lb/>And ran like fire from man to man; <lb/>'Twas here thou humbled Paria's foes, <lb/>And chac'd whole legions to the main! <lb/>Now in full corus, &amp;c.</p>

                <p><hi rend="center">7. </hi><lb/>But soon Columbia call'd him forth <lb/>Again to save her sinking fame, <lb/>To take the helm, and by his worth <lb/>To make her an immortal name! <lb/>Now in full chorus, &amp;c.</p>

                <p>After which, the procession passed by the Pre<lb break="no"/>sident, under the gallery, and then dispersed, high<lb break="no"/>ly satisfied with the occasion of their assembling, <lb/>and fully participating in the joy of the day.</p>
                <p>The Independent Companies then escorted the <lb/>President to his residence in Court-street–fired <lb/>three vollies, and then dismissed.</p>
                <p>In the evening the several public houses in <lb/>State-street were illuminated, the Coffee House, <lb/>Bunch of Grapes, Eastern Coffee House, &amp;c. <lb/>together, which mad a beautiful appearance.</p>
                <p>Fire works were also displayed in the said street.</p>
                <p>Rockets were likewise thrown from the French <lb/>ships in the harbour, and from Castle William.</p>
                <p>Two French frigates, L'Active and Le Sensi<lb break="no"/>ble, were delightfully illuminated, the former <lb/>with several hundred lamps, judiciously arraign<lb break="no"/> <lb/>ed.</p>
                <p>It is supposed the number assembled upon the <lb/>above occasion, amounted to 24,000 persons. <lb/>No unfavourable accident happened during the <lb/>whole scene–that we have heard of.</p>
                <p>The regularity and good order in the proces<lb break="no"/>sion afforded to the marhals the highest satisfac<lb break="no"/>tion, as well as to the numerous spectators.</p>
