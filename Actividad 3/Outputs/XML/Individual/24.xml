                <p>The weather last week, in this city, and su<lb break="no"/>burbs, continued to be extremely hot until Sunday <lb/>midnight, after a thunder squall. The change <lb/>which then took place was very sudden and un<lb break="no"/>healthy.</p>
                <p>Upwards of twenty persons fell unhappy [?]ic <lb/>tions to the heat last week; and it is said, <lb/>that as many of them died by over labouring <lb/>as by drinking cold water, Raw rum has been <lb/>found exceedingly pernicious in this extreme heat; <lb/>–man who was seen intoxicated but a few mom<lb break="no"/>ments before, suddenly fell on one of those days <lb/>–and the cry was–" Poor fellow! he has cer<lb break="no"/>tainly drank too much cold water!" Cold wa<lb break="no"/>ter has however been instantaneously fatal in se - <lb/>veral instances. <lb/>[ <hi rend="italic">To be concluded in our next</hi>.]</p>
