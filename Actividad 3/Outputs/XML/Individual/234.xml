                <p><hi rend="enlarged-capital">T</hi> he subject of emigration is rising in importance <lb/>from year to year, and cannot lose its interest as long <lb/>as much misery or much discontent exists among our <lb/>working classes. Upper Canada, the great recipient of <lb/>our surplus population, is 4000 miles from Britain, a <lb/>distance which looks extremely formidable ; but such <lb/>is the amazing economy of water carriage, when se<lb break="no"/>conded by good arrangements, that the voyage by sea <lb/>to Montreal can be made at as small expense as the <lb/>journey by land to Manchester ! The passage money <lb/>from Dublin to Montreal or Quebec (exclusive of food) <lb/>has been as low as 30s ; and it would not be higher <lb/>probably from Leith or Greenock, if the emigrants <lb/>were in sufficient numbers, and so prompt in their ar<lb break="no"/>rangements, that the vessel lost no time beyond what <lb/>was strictly necessary for taking her full compliment <lb/>aboard. If the ship is detained a month before this is <lb/>got, the owners must, of course, be indemnified for the <lb/>detention by a higher fare. Four stone of oatmeal, <lb/>with a little ham or salt fish for variety, will subsist a <lb/>man or woman on the voyage ; and thus a human be<lb break="no"/>ing can be conveyed over a distance equal to one-sixth <lb/>part of the circumference of the globe, and six times <lb/>longer, we dare say, than the wanderings of Ulysses, at <lb/>the small coast of 45s !</p>
                <p>In an article in May 1832, we pointed out the rapid <lb/>strides with which emigration was advancing ; and <lb/>some Parliamentary papers we have received since, ex<lb break="no"/>hibit new proofs of its extraordinary progress. It <lb/>has, in fact, outstripped the expectations of the most <lb/>sanguine.</p>
                <p>The following table shows the number of person who <lb/>have emigrated in the last eight years to North America, <lb/>the Cape, and Australia :–</p>
                <p>British America. United States. Cape of G. Hope. Australia. Total. <lb/>1825 8,714 5,551 114 485 14,891 <lb/>1826 12,818 7,063 116 903 20,900 <lb/>1827 12, 14,526 114 715 28,003 <lb/>1828 12,084 12,817 135 1,056 26,092 <lb/>1829 13,307 15,678 197 2,916 31,198 <lb/>1830 30,574 24,887 204 1,242 56,907 <lb/>1831 58,067 23,418 11 1,561 83,160 <lb/>1832 66,339 32,872 196 3,733 103,140</p>
                <p>It will be seen from this table how steady the in<lb break="no"/>crease of emigration has been, especially to Canada. <lb/>It must be observed, that a great proportion, probably <lb/>more than a half of those who sailed for the United <lb/>States, were destined for the British colonies, and only <lb/>chose that route as the most eligible, on account of the <lb/>facilities which the Hudson and its associated canals <lb/>present for travelling to the upper province. Canada <lb/>and Nova Scotia must have drawn at least 80,000 set<lb break="no"/>tlers from Britain last year ; and yet, such are the ca<lb break="no"/>pacities of these colonies for absorbing population, that <lb/>the price of labour was not lowered in the least degree ; <lb/>and from the previous arrangements made, it is an<lb break="no"/>nounced that a much larger number of persons could <lb/>have been received without inconvenience ! Sanguine <lb/>as we were upon the subject, we did not anticipate that <lb/>emigration could be conducted on such a scale, with <lb/>the extraordinary ease, certainty, and economy now ex<lb break="no"/>emplified. Those who reflect on the distress and <lb/>perplexity which would be produced by land<lb break="no"/>ing the <hi rend="italic">sixth-part</hi>  of eighty thousand strangers on <lb/>the shores of Britain in one summer, will appreciate <lb/>the extremely dissimilar condition of a colony which, <lb/>with less than a million inhabitants, can take in <lb/>eighty-thousand new settlers in the same period without <lb/>embarassment or confusion.</p>
                <p>The general result is, that Britain sent off 103,000 <lb/>souls from her population last year, of whom a[?] number <lb/>sailed 7000 miles, a number 14,000, and those who <lb/>made the shortest voyage, 4000 miles. The annals of <lb/>emigration afford nothing approaching to this in any <lb/>part of the world ; and yet we may reasonably expect to <lb/>see still greater things atcheived.</p>
                <p>It appears from the various census since 1801, that <lb/>the annual increase in Britain, if no persons left it, <lb/>would be about 350,000; or we may place the fact in <lb/>a more striking light by stating, that <hi rend="italic">there are about a </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">thousand persons more in the three kingdoms every </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">day than there was on the day before</hi>. If by raising <lb/>the habits and ideas of the labouring classes, we could <lb/>get this daily increase reduced one half, and the <lb/>other half could be carried off by emigration–if we <lb/>could by this means keep the supply of labour station<lb break="no"/>ary while capital was increasing, a great improvement <lb/>would be effected in the state of the population. Now <lb/>from what has been stated it appears that the emigrants <lb/>who leave our shores annually amount to nearly one<lb break="no"/>third of the annual excess already ; and in a year or <lb/>two there is every probability that it will amount to <lb/>one-half.</p>
                <p>Of 51,200 emigrants who landed at Quebec and <lb/>Montreal last year, 17,500 went from England, <lb/>28,200 from Ireland, and 5,500 from Scotland. In <lb/>the year 1831, the numbers were, from England 10,300, <lb/>Ireland 34,100, Scotland 5,300.</p>
                <p>Of the emigrants from Scotland last year, 1716 sail<lb break="no"/>ed from Greenock, 1145 from Leith, 638 from Cro<lb break="no"/>marty, 478 from Aberdeen, 439 from Dundee, 231 <lb/>from Alloa, 181 from Islay, 175 from Anna, 160 from <lb/>Glasgow, 112 from Leven, 110 from Campbeltown, <lb/>and numbers under 100 from Stanraer, Peterhead, and <lb/>Irvine.</p>
                <p>Of the emigrants to the United States last year <lb/>15,754 sailed from Liverpool, 5,546 from London <lb/>2,742 from Bristol, 2,613 from Londonderry, and <lb/>1,711 from Greenock.</p>
                <p>Mr Buchanan, the Government agent at Quebec, <lb/>states in his Report, that "the general description of <lb/>emigrants who arrived last year ; many respectable and wealthy fa<lb break="no"/>milies came from all part of the united kingdom ; and <lb/>the extent of property and specie brought into the <lb/>country by them is exceedingly great, fully amounting <lb/>to from t600,000 to t700,000 sterling." About 5000 <lb/>persons were sent out by pecuniary aid from parishes <lb/>or landlords ; and there were 1700 "commuted pen<lb break="no"/>sioners" (military, we believe), many of them men of <lb/>irregular habits, and ill fitted for the situation of set<lb break="no"/>tlers. Of these, about 100 returned to Britain. The <lb/>fear of cholera was a considerable check to emigration. <lb/>It appeared in Quebec on the 8th of June, and the <lb/>persons who arrived after that, suffered much from <lb/>the difficulty of procuring lodgings even for a day ; <lb/>but Mr Buchanan estimates the whole number of emi<lb break="no"/>grants who fell victims to the disease, at no more than</p>
                <p>"The demand for all classes of working people <lb/>(says the Report,) has never been exceeded in the Ca<lb break="no"/>nadas, particularly since the abatement of the cholera, <lb/>and I can assure your Lordship that, during my late <lb/>tour through the districts and settlements of Upper <lb/>Canada, I did not see an industrious emigrant who <lb/>could not meet with emplyment. The number of <lb/>that class arrived this year is not adequate to supply <lb/>the demand created by the more wealthy emigrants. <lb/>This was particularly felt in the Western and London <lb/>districts of the upper province, where the want of la<lb break="no"/>bourers was so great that it was found necessary to en<lb break="no"/>courage a number to come over from Ohio and Pen<lb break="no"/>nsylvania." This was written on the 12th Dec. 1832, <lb/>and the arrival of emigrants closed in October.</p>
