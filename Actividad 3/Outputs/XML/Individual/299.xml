                <pb/><head><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration To New South  <lb/>Wales. </hi></head>
                <p>We have received a copy of a Series of Resolu<lb break="no"/>tions passed, on the 23d of October 1840, by the <lb/>Legislative Council of New South Wales, on the <lb/>subject of immigration into colony. The <lb/>object of these resolutions is to encourage emigra<lb break="no"/>tion from the mother country, by showing the <lb/>demand for labour in New South Wales, and the <lb/>advantages offered to the immigrant. We have <lb/>only room for a few of the more important resolu<lb break="no"/>tions :</p>
                <p>Resolved. That there exists throughout the colony <lb/>an urgent and increasing want of working hands, in <lb/>every branch of industry ; that there is ample employ<lb break="no"/>ment for emigrants, at highly renumerating wages <lb/>without the interruption, in this mild climate, experi<lb break="no"/>enced in colder countries during the winter months ; <lb/>and that, even during the worst period of the past <lb/>severe drought, no persons able and willing to work <lb/>found any difficult in procuring advantageous employ<lb break="no"/>ment.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That, in the opinion of this Council, there <lb/>can be no more advantageous field for the employment <lb/>of industry than is presented in New South Wales– <lb/>experience proving, that able-bodied, sober, indus<lb break="no"/>trious and careful emigrants may, within a few years <lb/>after their arrival, rise form the condition of labourers <lb/>to be themselves employers of labour; by which pro<lb break="no"/>cess, and by the progressive increase of the flocks and <lb/>herds of the colony, a constant demand for additional <lb/>labourers is created, sufficient to remove all apprehen<lb break="no"/>sion of a dearth of employment for as many as may <lb/>arise.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That this Council would particularly in<lb break="no"/>stance the large and increasing sums at the credit of <lb/>the working classes in the Savings Bank of New South <lb/>Wales, as affording gratifying evidence of their pros<lb break="no"/>perous condition, the deposits having increased from <lb/>t24,469, the amount on 31st December 1835, to t127,000 <lb/>on 31st August 1840.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That great additional advantage must <lb/>accrue to the mother country from the large consump<lb break="no"/>tion in this colony of British produce and manufac<lb break="no"/>tures, the declared value of which, from 1826 to 1839, <lb/>according to the official returns for that period, <lb/>amounted to more than eight millions sterling, having <lb/>progressively increased from t280,000, the amount in <lb/>1826, to t1,251,969 in 1839 ; whilst the exports from <lb/>the colony, including the produce of the fisheries, in<lb break="no"/>creased from t106,600 in the former year, to t948,776 <lb/>in the latter–the total amount being t6,187,530 for the <lb/>whole period.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That the trade between the mother coun<lb break="no"/>try and this colony, together with the whale fisheries <lb/>in the adjourning seas, also affords a valuable nursery <lb/>for seamen, important in this respect, in proportion to <lb/>the distance from Great Britain, and calculated to <lb/>strengthen and secure her maritime power ; and that <lb/>this field for the employment of British shipping must <lb/>increase with the growing prosperity of the colony– <lb/>considerations which appear to this Council to consti<lb break="no"/>tute a strong additional claim, on the part of the colony, <lb/>to the fostering care of the British Government.</p>
