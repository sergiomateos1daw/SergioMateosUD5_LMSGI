                <p><pb n="8"/><hi rend="center">LANDS in AMERICA for SALE.</hi></p>
                <p> THESE two adjoining TRACKS of LAND in the <lb/>County of FAYETTE and State of KENTUCKY. <lb/>The one track consists of 7000 acres, and is divided into <lb/>15 plantations of 500 acres each; eight of these plantations, <lb/>are still unsold, and are now offered at the low price of <lb/>137l. being only 5s. 6d. per acre. The other track coun<lb break="no"/>sists of 3086 acres, and is to be sold in one lot, at 5s. 6d. <lb/>per acre. There is a fine stream of water running through <lb/>these two tracks of land, which communicates with the <lb/>great river Ohio, so that Mills may be erect.</p>
                <p> In Fayette County is Lexington, where the Courts of the <lb/>State of Kentucky are held, and where all public business <lb/>is transacted Lexington is in the neighbourhood of these <lb/>lands, and Fayette county is the nearest and most convenient <lb/>for Philadelphia, Baltimore, City of Washington, &amp;c. The <lb/>soil of Kentucky is deep and black, and lies upon a bed of <lb/>lime-stone and coal. THe natural grown of the country <lb/>are large walnuts, honey, poplar and sugar trees. The <lb/>surface is covered with blue grass, clover, and wild rye, <lb/>grape vines running to the tops of the trees. Shrubs and <lb/>plants grow spontaneously, and afford a beautiful blossom <lb/>of a rich and exquisite fragrance. Cotton and sugar are <lb/>manufactured to advantage. wheat ,barley, oats, flax, <lb/>and hemp, yield abundantly; indeed, it is assumed that <lb/>there have been raised 100 bushels upon one acre, but the <lb/>common produce is from 40 to 60 bushels an acre.</p>
                <p> Owing to the peculiar richness of the soil, and fine cli<lb break="no"/>mate of the country, no part of America has been to re<lb break="no"/>pidly settled. The returns made to Congress, upon 1st May <lb/>1792 state them at 76 000. In March 1793, there were upwards of 100,000. And, from their astonishing increase <lb/>since, they may be estimated at 200,000. Eleven years <lb/>ago, Kentucky lay in a forest, but now she exhibits an <lb/>extensive settlement, divided into seven populous counties, in <lb/>which are a great number of flourishing towns, and con<lb break="no"/>tains more inhabitants than are in Georgia, Delaware, and <lb/>Rhode Island States. There are about 70 churches in Ken<lb break="no"/>tucky and mostly PResbyterians. There is a College; and <lb/>Schools are established in every town. There is a Print<lb break="no"/>ing-office; a Weekly Gazette published. There are Pa<lb break="no"/>per Mills, O<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> Mills,<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>ing Mills, Saw Mills, and a great <lb/>number of Grist Mills. Considerable quantities of Sugar, <lb/>are made from the Sugar Trees. Salt-works are in every <lb/>part of the country, and the inhabitants are supplied at a <lb/>low price.</p>
                <p> The taxes upon land are very low. Any person who <lb/>goes from Europe becomes an American Citizen on his ar<lb break="no"/>rival in this new State, and is entitled to be elected to any <lb/>office in the Commonwealth.</p>
                <p> For farther particulars apply to MR. John Granger, wri<lb break="no"/>ter to the signet; David Niven, writer, Glasgow; or to <lb/>Mr. John Finlayson, writer, Cupar Fife;</p>
