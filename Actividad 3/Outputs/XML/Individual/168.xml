                <p><pb/>India</p>
                <p>We have great pleasure in publishing the following <lb/>interesting letter from India: â€“</p>
                <p>"Madras, Feb. 4, 1820. <lb/>"I have, thank God, no very brilliant events to <lb/>communicate to you, but if the happiness of man is the <lb/>legitimate object of all Government, it is good to learn <lb/>that British India is at peace, and that a temperate <lb/>and radical reform is gradually going on under the <lb/>Marquess of Hastings' administration. The establish<lb break="no"/>ment of schools, and a free press, are the moving prin<lb break="no"/>ciples by which this great advancement in the state of <lb/>society will be accomplished, unless checked by im<lb break="no"/>pious powers.</p>
                <p>"On the subject of these schools, it is not necessary <lb/>here to dilate. Suffice it to observe, that it is in the <lb/>power of any Government, abitrary or free, to educate <lb/>the great bulk of its subjects, and thereby to advance <lb/>them in knowledge, civilization, and happiness, in <hi rend="italic">the </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">shortest</hi>  possible period.</p>
                <p>"The establishment of a <hi rend="italic">free press in Asia</hi>  is, in my <lb/>estimation, as useful and magnanimous an art as ever <lb/>adorned the biography of any Statesman. What, say <lb/>its detractors, is setting loose a parcel of printer's devils <lb/>so great an act? No, but setting loose all the intel<lb break="no"/>ligence of the age to work upon the public mind and <lb/>conduct, is an act of unrivalled benevolence. Be it <lb/>asserted that a free press is only applicable to an ad<lb break="no"/>vanced state of society, I deny the position ; it is not <lb/>founded in reason or experience. I contend on the <lb/>other hand, that where least knowledge and msot evil <lb/>exist, there is the greatest scope for improvement ; and <lb/>I offer Scotland as a proof of the efficacy[?] of education <lb/>and a free press.</p>
                <p>"The Marquess of Hastings, Governor General of <lb/>India, has, in the newspapers of Madras and Calcutta, <lb/>been accused of having sent two persons of the name of <lb/>Hastings, to <hi rend="italic">unhealthy</hi>  climates, the one to the East <lb/>and the other to the West Indies, where they <hi rend="italic">died ; </hi><lb/>and for the <hi rend="italic">base</hi>  purpose of securing to his family the <lb/>title of Huntingdon. This, you must be aware, was <lb/>touching his sensitive honour to the quick ; and it <lb/>would seem as if some one inimical to a free press, had <lb/>introduced the paragraph to irritate him. But this <lb/>virtuous man, who would not tread on an insect, al<lb break="no"/>lowed this shameful slander to pass unnoticed. It stood <lb/>refuted in every bosom, and his manly forbearance <lb/>tended but to give further proofs of his attachment to <lb/>our infant liberty. Attacks have likewise been made <lb/>on Sir E. East, our Chief Justice. He complained, <lb/>they say, of these alleged libels to the Chief Magistrate, <lb/><hi rend="italic">who desired him to have recourse to the law</hi>  Conceive <lb/>not, however, that I am the advocate for a licentious <lb/>press. My maxim is, that a great power, when mis<lb break="no"/>chievously applied, must be hurtful, and when well <lb/>applied, beneficial, in proportion to its strength.</p>
                <p>"You will rejoice to learn that Mr Elphinstone, <lb/>Governor of Bombay, has done away with the Censor<lb break="no"/>ship of the Press. This wise Statesman, being a friend <lb/>to freedom, and having <hi rend="italic">experienced</hi>  the benefits which <lb/>had arisen in Bengal from the measure (for scarce a <lb/>day no passes that some abuse is not brought to light <lb/>by the press), adopted it the moment he came into <lb/>power, and thus proved himself a public benefactor.</p>
                <p>"To conclude, it is my firm conviction, that the <lb/>diffusion of knowledge, through the medium of educa<lb break="no"/>tion and a free press, will more than any other mea<lb break="no"/>sure accelerate the improvement and heighten the pros<lb break="no"/>perity, not only of British India, but of the surround<lb break="no"/>ing world."</p>
