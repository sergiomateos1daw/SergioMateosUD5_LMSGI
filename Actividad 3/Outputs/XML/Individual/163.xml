                <p>Among the emigrants proceeding to seek ano<lb break="no"/>ther country on the shores of Southern Africa, <lb/>four vessels, containing above 600 souls, have <lb/>sailed from Liverpool, bound to the Cape of <lb/>Good Hope; three of them under the command <lb/>and direction of a naval officer, and one under <lb/>private superintendance. The public agent was <lb/>instructed to provide every accomodation which <lb/>could minister to the health or comfort of the fa<lb break="no"/>milies who were to embark</p>
                <p>Thursday afternoon, the brig Alexander <lb/>sailed from Greenock with emigrants for Prince <lb/>Edward's island. This vessel had 85 pas<lb break="no"/>sengers on board, of which 17 were children.</p>
                <p>On Friday the ship Alexander, Young, sailed <lb/>from Greenock for Quebec with 96 passengers.</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter, dated in Perth, Upper <lb/>Canada, 18th January – "Liberty and Equality <lb/>are the predominant principles here. A common <lb/>labourer from Scotland is entitled to a lot of <lb/>land. Whenever he finds he can subsist upon <lb/>his farm, he becomes as high as the best in the <lb/>township. Every settler, though ever so poor, <lb/>has a vote for the member for the township, <lb/>and has full liberty to speak at every meeting. <lb/>– It is nothing uncommon to see a poor Glasgow <lb/>weaver, who came among us with scarce a stitch <lb/>to cover his nakedness, strutting between the <lb/>stumps of his trees as pompous as an Ediburgh <lb/>Magistrate."</p>
