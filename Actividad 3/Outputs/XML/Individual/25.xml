                <p><pb n="2"/>We have been favoured by a friend with the <lb/>following extract of a letter from Grenada, by <lb/>the last West India Packet.</p>
                <p>"A Mr. Câ€“ has just arrive here from <lb/>Martinico, where he left the white inhabitants in <lb/>arms. The negroes there had conceived an idea, <lb/>that the Parliament of England had set the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish negroes free ; where upon those on several of <lb/>the most considerable estates assembled together <lb/>to the amount of 4000, and retired to the moun<lb break="no"/>tains, declaring, they would no longer be slaves ; <lb/>saying, that they had as good a right to be free, <lb/>as the negroes in the English islands. What has <lb/>been the event is unknown ; but some reports say <lb/>that they had arms, and had resisted the military <lb/>and the militia ; and that 400 had been taken <lb/>and condemned to die. It is a little singular that <lb/>such an alarming spirit of discontent should first <lb/>make its appearance among the French negroes, <lb/>if they are (as has been assented by several writers) <lb/>so much more civilized, so much better treated, <lb/>than those of the English islands. God knows <lb/>what bloodshed may soon follow, from the mis<lb break="no"/>taken humanity of some well meaning, but ill <lb/>informed leaders among you."</p>
