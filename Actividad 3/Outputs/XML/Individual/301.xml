                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">New Zealand Company</hi></p>
                <p>A very lively and interesting scene occurred on Fri<lb break="no"/>day, off the West India Dock entrance, at Blackwall, <lb/>by the preparation for departure of three fine vessels <lb/>with "improvers" for "Nelson," the second colony of <lb/>New Zealand. The Directors of the Company and <lb/>several hundred persons of rank and wealth met there <lb/>to bid farewell to the enterprising emigrants, who ap<lb break="no"/>peared highly delighted with the honour extended to <lb/>them, and in high spirits with the anticipations of the <lb/>successful result of their mission. After viewing the <lb/>arrangeents made for the comfort of all on board, <lb/>the Directors returned to the West India Dock Tavern, <lb/>where a sumptuous breakfast was provided in the large <lb/>room. The Duke of Sussex took the chair, and was <lb/>supported on the right by the Earl of Devon, and on <lb/>the left by Jos. Somes, Esq., the Governor of the Com<lb break="no"/> <lb/>pany. Among the guests were the Duchess of Inver<lb break="no"/>ness, the Duke and Duchess of Somerset, Lords Cot<lb break="no"/>tenham, Sandon, Marcus Hill, Clements, Viscount <lb/>Ebrington, M.P., the Hon. Frederick Dundas, Hon. <lb/>Captain Drummon, Messrs P. Maxwell Stewart, M.P., <lb/>Gowen, G. F. Young, W. C. Young, and the Misses <lb/>Young; the Hon. Mrs Douglas, the Hon. Miss Petre, <lb/>Rev, Dr Hinds, J. E. Boulcott, Captain Hine, Sir Ro<lb break="no"/>bert and Lady Harland, Sir John Doxatt, M. D.; Mr, <lb/>Mrs, and Miss Pennington; Lieutenant Lean, her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's Emigration Agent; MEssrs Jordan, E. G. Wake<lb break="no"/>field, Dudley Costello, Mr and Mrs S. C. Brees, Captain <lb/>Sinclair, R.N.,&amp;c. &amp;c. The rapid progress which the <lb/>grand undertaking of colonizing New Zealand has <lb/>made, was more than once alluded to by his Royal <lb/>Highness and other distinguished speakers on both <lb/>sides of politics, and its many advantages were dwelt <lb/>upon with much sincerity of feeling. Several gentle<lb break="no"/>men of the first families go out with this expedition, <lb/>which will be closely followed by several first-rate <lb/>ships.</p>
