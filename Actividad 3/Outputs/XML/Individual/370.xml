                <p> This city and its vicinity were exceedingly a<lb break="no"/>larmed, last Sabbath, about four o'clock, M. P. by <lb/>a tremendous westerly tornado, which continued <lb/>about 20 minutes, twisting off limbs of trees, un<lb break="no"/>roofing houses, and tumbling down chimneys in <lb/>various parts of the city. Unused to such un<lb break="no"/>ruly gusts, the citizens, particularly the fair, were <lb/>thrown into a momentary d<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>ation. Terrible <lb/>was the havoc on the water–in vain did the <hi rend="italic">Sab<lb break="no"/>bath breakers</hi>  cry for mercy–in a moment, in the <lb/>twinkling of an eye, were they hurried to the bot<lb break="no"/>tom, and melancholy was the scene. It is said <lb/>that 29 persons lost their lives in this neighbour<lb break="no"/>hood, but we have not been able to ascertain who <lb/>they were for certainty. Report says, that a Mr. <lb/>Wade, his wife and two of their children, his bro<lb break="no"/>ther, and a young man, were all, except the last <lb/>mentioned, drowned from one boat near Yellow <lb/>Hook, a few miles from the city. It is also said, a sloop overset with 16 persons, all but one of <lb/>whom were drowned.</p>
                <p> We learn that the<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> extended to Philadel<lb break="no"/>phia, that ship was driven from her moorings <lb/>there and sunk, and that the road from thence to <lb/>this city, shrewn violent tokens of its visitation.</p>

                <p> The society for promoting the manufacture of <lb/>maple sugar, met at Albany, July 3, have grant<lb break="no"/>ed 75 dollars, bounty, to Thaddeus Scribner, of <lb/>Herkermer county, for having produced 600 lb. <lb/>of grained maple sugar, of superior quality– of <lb/>50 dollars to Comfort Cook, of Otsego, for pro<lb break="no"/>ducing sugar of equal quality, but a less quantity <lb/>–and of 25 dollars to J. Harris, and R. Huntley, <lb/>of Saratoga county, for the third rate quantity. <lb/>The society resolved, to exhibit samples from <lb/>each of these parcels to the legislature at their text session, in order to induce them to give lar<lb break="no"/>ger bounties, for the further encouragement of <lb/>this important manufacture.</p>

                <p> On Saturday last, arrived in this city, directly <lb/>from Scotland.–Nesbit, Esq. a gentleman <lb/>who comes warmly recommended by the celebra<lb break="no"/>ted Dr. Robinson, and several other literary cha<lb break="no"/>racters of eminence in that country, as a master of the science of canaling, from several years ex<lb break="no"/>perience both in Holland and in Scotland.</p>
                <p> The President of the Northern Inland L.<supplied reason="copy blur">?.</supplied> <lb/>Company, attended by Mr. Nesbit, and a commit<lb break="no"/>ee of Directors, left this city, this morning on a <lb/>tour, to explore the rive from Troy upwards, <lb/>for the purpose of prosecuting the canals with <lb/>spirit the remaining part of the season, and mak<lb break="no"/>ing preparations for its more active prosecution <lb/>in the ensuing year.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Philadelphia, July</hi>  12.</hi></p>
                <p> Accounts from South Carolina and Georgia, <lb/>with regard to their prospects of the ensuing crops, <lb/>are very unfavourable, no rains of any consequence <lb/>having fallen in the more eastern disctricts of these <lb/>states since the beginning of April; at which time <lb/>the low country was, in a manner inundaed. The <lb/>Indigo plantations, when the last vessels sailed, <lb/>were almost despaired of, for the next crop, and <lb/>the rice swamps promised not much better.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">July</hi>  18.</hi></p>
                <p> We are sorry to learn from New York, that <lb/>spirit of party, respecting a late election of Gover<lb break="no"/>nor" of the State, has arisen to such a height as to <lb/>have occasioned several duels a week. On Thurs<lb break="no"/>day morning last, Colonel W<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> and Mr. Wil<cb break="no"/>cocks, both of New York, had a meeting, and ex<lb break="no"/>changed pistol shot, but their friends in<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> <lb/>prevented any bad consequences.–Colonel Willet <lb/>is friendly to Governor Clinton's election, which Mr. Wilcock opposes.</p>
                <p> We hear from Maryland that a number of gen<lb break="no"/>tlmen of the state are about establishing a society <lb/>in Port-To<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> for the dissemination of useful <lb/>political knowledge, the study of the constitution <lb/>of their country, and the keeping up among the <lb/>people if possible, a knowledge of their rights as <lb/>free citizens of the greatest, and perhaps the only, <lb/>true republic in the universe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">August</hi>  6.</hi></p>
                <p> On Thursday morning, was witnessed a very me<lb break="no"/>lancholy event at Mr. Henry Kizer's power mill, <lb/>in lower Merion township, Montgomery country, <lb/>between the hours of 9 and 10. There was a large <lb/>quantity of powder in the mill, which by accident <lb/>took fire and blew up with a great explosion, <lb/>which was heard at Schuylkill ferry, and was there <lb/>supposed to be an earthquake. Mr Kizer, and <lb/>three others who were in the mill, were blown to pieces; and a Mr. Henry Fraily, a copartner <lb/>of Mr. Kizer, was so wounded that his life is dis<lb break="no"/>pared of. A young woman who happened to be <lb/>near the mill at the time it blew up, had both her <lb/>legs broken, and was otherwise very much injured, <lb/>by one of the rafters which was carried from the <lb/>building in the violence of the explosion.</p>

                <p> We learn from North Carolina, that a fire <lb/>broke out in the town of Washington, on Wed<lb break="no"/>nesday the 27th ult. which burn nearly half the <lb/>town.–The loss in houses, goods, &amp;c. is said to <lb/>be very considerable.</p>

                <p> Extract of a letter from Captain Paul, of the State <lb/>Levies, dated Middle Block house, of the fron<lb break="no"/>tiers of Washington country, July 16, 1792."</p>
                <p>"The Indians on Tuesday last killed two men <lb/>and one woman, and stole seven horses between <lb/>the states of Crays Creek and Col. Shepherd's in <lb/>Ohio county, Virginia.–Lieut. Gray and four<lb break="no"/>teen of my men followed them over the Ohio, as <lb/>far as the head of the Soufish, but the Indians being <lb/>on horseback they returned without coming up <lb/>with them. On Saturday last, at Dilly's station <lb/>opposite the mouth of Grave creek, the Indians <lb/>came into one of the houses and killed four and <lb/>wounded one; the number of Indians was suppos <lb/>ed to be twenty. It is thought they will strike <lb/>this quarter. To-morrow morning I intend to <lb/>start with a party to try and fall in with them."</p>

                <p> We are informed, that one day last week, a <lb/>Mr. Barret, living near the South Branch, acci<lb break="no"/>dentally shot his wife;–he was fixing a flint to <lb/>his gun, and incautiously dragging the trigger, not <lb/>knowing the gun was loaded, discharged the <lb/>whole contents into her body, and she died in a <lb/>few moments after–the unfortunate woman had <lb/>a young child at her breast, but it providentially <lb/>received no injury.</p>
                <p> Alexander M'Gillivray advertises for a tutor, <lb/>willing to instruct Indian children in the rudiments of the English language; and the first prin<lb break="no"/>ciples of<supplied reason="copy blur">arithmetic</supplied>.
