                <p><pb n="6"/>" There have been an amazing number of re<lb break="no"/>cruiting parties here these 8 days by gone, and <lb/>I dare say they have got among them at least 200 <lb/>recruits this week. Only in two or three parti<lb break="no"/>cular instances have large sums been given–the <lb/>bounty is generally from 5 to 6 guineas.</p>
                <p>" This place is at present full of people, many <lb/>of whom may be said to have no more than what <lb/>keeps soul and body together–I heartily wish <lb/>they would also take away our loose women–they <lb/>were never so numerous, nor so troublesome. If <lb/>it was not for the recruiting service, and the pros<lb break="no"/> of a Bridewell, which it is hoped our Magi<lb break="no"/>states will shortly set seriously about, we would have but dismal prospects before us the ensuing <lb/>winter.–I am informed, government propose <lb/>sending 2000 of our bad women–they would never be <lb/>missed out of this place."</p>
