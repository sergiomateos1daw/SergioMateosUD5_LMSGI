                <p><pb n="4"/> Extract of a letter received from Calcutta, dated <lb/>22d November, 1819:--"An afflicting circumstance <lb/>has recently taken place. The Captain of the Bengal, <lb/>a Liverpool trader, very lately gave a ball on board <lb/>his ship, which was about to sail for England. The <lb/>party was very small, and more than half were taken <lb/>ill with a violent fever immediately afterwards. I <lb/>buried the Captain and the Surgeon a few days after <lb/>it; not less than ten of the part died within as many <lb/>days, all younger persons. Only one officer survives <lb/>of those who left England in the ship, and he is just <lb/>recovering in the Hospital. All sorts of conjectures <lb/>were made, but it turns out that there were 17,000 <lb/>undressed buffalo horns in the hold, in a complete <lb/>state of putrefaction. This vessel has sailed for Eng<lb break="no"/>land in this state without a Surgeon. I question <lb/>whether it will ever arrive; it ought not to be ad<lb break="no"/>mitted among other shipping if it does;–the opening <lb/>of the hold will be death to him who does it, and per<lb break="no"/>haps to many more."--In consequence of this disas<lb break="no"/>trous information, Ministers have issued an order for <lb/>the vessel, on her arrival at Liverpool, or any other <lb/>part, to undergo quarantine.– <hi rend="italic">London Paper.</hi></p>
                <p>All apprehension on the above subject is complete<lb break="no"/>ly done away by the following letter from Liverpool, <lb/>May 14:–</p>
                <p>"I noticed a paragraph in the London papers, <lb/>respecting the Bengal, of this port, at Calcutta, stat<lb break="no"/>ing that a number of deaths had taken place, sup<lb break="no"/>posed in consequence of the Infectious vapours arising <lb/>from some buffalo horns.–The Bengal arrived here <lb/>April 5, and has been discharged without any of <lb/>those dreadful consequences which the medical gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen of Calcutta prognosticated.–I should rather <lb/>suppose that the fatal consequences which ensued <lb/>to those individuals who attended the ball given on <lb/>board this vessel at Calcutta, would be none justly <lb/>attributed to the exposure to night air."</p>
