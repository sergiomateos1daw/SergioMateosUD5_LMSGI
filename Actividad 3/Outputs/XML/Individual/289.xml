                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Afflicting Case of Destitution.</hi> â€“Some <lb/>time ago a vessel was advertised to sail from this port <lb/>for Australia, and to take out Government settlers free <lb/>of expense. A family in Shetland, consisting of the <lb/>husband, wife, and six of a young family, sold off their <lb/>effects and came to Leith for the purpose of availing <lb/>themselves of this opportunity to settle in the above <lb/>colony. On applying to the agent, however, they were <lb/>informed that they did not come under the description <lb/>of persons wanted. Since, therefore, they have <lb/>lived in Leith till their little all has been exhausted, <lb/>and the husband, from the combined effects of disap<lb break="no"/>pointment and want, has been thrown upon a sick-bed, <lb/>and the whole family are literally in a state of starvation. <lb/>Several private individuals, with a benevolence that <lb/>does them the highest credit, have temporarily sup<lb break="no"/>plied their wants ; but the hands of private charity is <lb/>soon crippled, and unless something else be immedi<lb break="no"/>ately done, we may have soon to report one or more of <lb/>their deaths from the actual want of the necessaries of <lb/>life. The object of the present notice therefore is to <lb/>draw forth the sympathies of the charitable, to relive a <lb/>family thus suddenly involved in want and misery, who, <lb/>from their industrious habits and every way excellent <lb/>characters, left their native home with the good wishes <lb/>of all their friends. Any donations, either in money <lb/>or clothes, will be thankfully received by Mr Andrew <lb/>Spence, of the firm of Messrs Cunninham &amp; Spence, <lb/>No. 62, Tolbooth-wynd, Leith.</p>
