There could be no stronger proof of <lb/>the political sagacity and statesmanlike views of the <lb/>Duke, than his approval of the Wakefield system <lb/>of colonization, and no better mode of perpetuating <lb/>his name than by bestowing it on the metropolis of the <lb/>"Great Britain of the Southern Hemisphere."</p>
