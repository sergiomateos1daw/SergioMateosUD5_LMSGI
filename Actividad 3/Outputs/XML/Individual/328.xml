                <p><pb n="6"/> The following, it is said, are the authentic <lb/>particulars of General St Clair's expedition in <lb/>America. The Miamis Indians had been for a <lb/>long time extremely troublesome to the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans, and it was determined to drive them to the <lb/>back country. General St. Clair completely ac<lb break="no"/>complished this object; but on the 22d Oct. a <lb/>detachment of 400 Americans fell in with the In<lb break="no"/>dians on the River St. Joseph, where a severe <lb/>battle was fought. Many Indians were killed, <lb/>but the Americans lost the field; several Officers, <lb/>and 150 men were killed, and they were not able <lb/>even to bring off their wounded. This success <lb/>will in all probability give the Indians new cou<lb break="no"/>rage, and induce them again to make head a<lb break="no"/>gainst the American army.</p>
