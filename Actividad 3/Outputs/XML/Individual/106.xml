                <p>This day at two o'clock, his Excellency the <lb/>Governor in Chief went in the usual state to the <lb/>Legislative Council Chamber, and being seated on <lb/>the Throne, the Gentlemen Usher of the Black <lb/>Rod was sent to command the presence of the As<lb break="no"/>sembly, which being come up, the Honourable <lb/>Speaker of the Assembly said–</p>
                <p>"May it please your Excellency,</p>
                <p>"His Majesty's faithful subjects, the representatives of <lb/>the province of Lower Canada, have passed a bill, intituled, <lb/>"An Act of facilitate the Circulation of Army Bills." Their <lb/>loyalty, and the happiness of this province in being connected <lb/>with, and powerfully protected by the British nation, are the <lb/>basis of their constitution, and the just grounds which gave <lb/>rise to the formation of the militia, and the firm determina<lb break="no"/>tion to defend this country against the unexpected and unjust <lb/>war that the United States have lately declared ; they are, <lb/>therefore, under the greatest obligation to your Excellency <lb/>for having communicated to them your wise precautions, on <lb/>the means to ameliorate and insure for several years, the <lb/>punctual payment of the army, by circulating bills, the reim<lb break="no"/>bursement of which is guaranteed in England. To give them <lb/>greater credit, the bill limits the sums necessary, and, more<lb break="no"/>over, provides for the interest, the advantages accruing there<lb break="no"/>from, and even for the payment of the principal in specie in <lb/>this province, which has become expressly bound for the <lb/>same at a fixed period, to any person whatever, who, from <lb/>the state of his private affairs, would prefer such payment.</p>
                <p>"In full confidence that, under the present and any un<lb break="no"/>foreseen circumstance, your Excellency is invested with all <lb/>necessary authority, the representatives of the province and <lb/>their constituents rely on the wisdom already experienced of <lb/>your administration, and in the name of the Commons of <lb/>Lower Canada, I have the honour to present this bill to your <lb/>Excellency, humbly requesting thereto his Majesty's assent."</p>
                <p>His Excellency was pleased to signify the Royal <lb/>assent.</p>
                <p>His Excellency then addressed both Houses, <lb/>and the Provincial Parliament was prorogued to the <lb/>16th of September.</p>
