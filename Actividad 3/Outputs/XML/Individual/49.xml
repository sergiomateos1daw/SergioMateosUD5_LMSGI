                <p><pb/>Letters from Jamaica say, that by vessels arri<lb break="no"/>ved there from Hispaniola, there are advices that <lb/>the French inhabitants of that island feel, with <lb/>unabating energy, the glorious cause in which <lb/>their patriotic countrymen in Old France are em<lb break="no"/>barked. Men of every class and description wear <lb/>the national cockade of blue and white. Their <lb/>accounts from France, similar in date and sub<lb break="no"/>stance to ours, have filled them with the most <lb/>lively hopes, and animated them with a spirit of <lb/>resistance to the measures of their Government, <lb/>as forcible as it was unexpected by those entrust<lb break="no"/>ed with the executive power. At Port au Prince <lb/>both the Governor and Intendant have rendered <lb/>themselves completely odious, by vain attempts <lb/>to counteract an impulse that is irresistible. The <lb/>effigy of Mons. Marbois, the latter, has been <lb/>hung and burnt; the people loudly insist that <lb/>both shall immediately quit the colony, and their <lb/>departure is hourly expected. The press, hither<lb break="no"/>to under the severest restraint, triumphs in its free<lb break="no"/>dom; and their weekly publications give an ac<lb break="no"/>count of the proceedings of the States General <lb/>without the smallest reserve.</p>
