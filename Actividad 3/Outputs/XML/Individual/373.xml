                <p><pb n="1"/><hi rend="center">FEDERAL LEGISLATURE.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">House </hi><hi rend="italic">of </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Representatives</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Dec</hi>. 3.</hi></p>
                <p> THE Secretary of the Senate announced, that <lb/>the Members of the Senate were ready to ad<lb break="no"/>mit the Members of the House of Representatives <lb/>in the Senate Chamber, in order to receive the Pre<lb break="no"/>sident's communication.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center">FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND OF  <lb/>THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</hi></p>
                <p> Since the commencement of the term for which I have <lb/>been again called into office, no fit occasion has arisen for <lb/>expressing to me fellow citizens at large, the deep and <lb/>respectful sense which I feel of the renewed testimony <lb/>of public approbation. While on the one hand it awaken<lb break="no"/>ed my gratitude for all those instances of affectionate par<lb break="no"/>tiality with which I have been honoured by my country; <lb/>on the other, it could not prevent an earnest wish for that <lb/>retirement, from which no private consideration should <lb/>ever have torn me. But influenced by the belief, that <lb/>my conduct would be estimated according to its real mo<lb break="no"/>tives; and that the people, and the authorities derived <lb/>from them, would support exertions having nothing per<lb break="no"/>sonal for their object, I have obeyed the suffrage which <lb/>commanded me to resume the executive power; and I <lb/>humbly implore that Being, on whose will the fate of <lb/>nations depends, to crown with success our mutual endea<lb break="no"/>vors for the general happiness.</p>
                <p> As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers <lb/>with whom the United States have the most extensive re<lb break="no"/>lations there was reason to apprehend that our intercourse <lb/>with them might be interrupted, and our disposition for <lb/>peace drawn into question, by the suspicions too often <lb/>entertained by belligerent nations. It seemed therefore <lb/>to be my duty to admonish our citizens of the consequen<lb break="no"/>ces of a contraband trade, and of hostile acts to any of <lb/>the parties; and to obtain by a declaration of the exist<lb break="no"/>ing legal state of things, an easier admission of our right <lb/>to the immunities belonging to our situation. Under <lb/>these impressions, the proclamation, which will be laid before you, was issued.</p>
                <p>In this posture of affairs, both new and delicate, I res<lb break="no"/>olved to adopt general rules which should conform to <lb/>the treaties and assert the privileges of the United <lb/>States. These were reduced into a system which will be <lb/>communicated to you. Although I have not thought <lb/>myself at liberty to forbid the sale of the prizes, permit<lb break="no"/>ted by our treaty of commerce with France, to be brought <lb/>into our ports; I have not refused to cause them to be <lb/>restored, when they were taken within the protection of <lb/>our territory, or by vessels commissioned, or equipped in <lb/>a warlike form within the limits of the United States.</p>
                <p>It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct, im<lb break="no"/>prove, or enforce this plan of procedure; and it will pro<lb break="no"/>bably be found expedient to extend the legal code, and <lb/>the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States to ma<lb break="no"/>ny cases which, though dependent on principles already <lb/>recognized, demand some further provisions.</p>
                <p> Where individuals shall, within the United States, ar<lb break="no"/>ray themselves in hostility against any of the powers at war, <lb/>or enter upon military expeditions or enterprizes within <lb/>the jurisdiction of the United States; or where the pe<lb break="no"/>nalties on violations of the law of nations may have been <lb/>indistinctly marked, or are inadequate; those offenses <lb/>cannot receive too early and close an attention, and require prompt and decisive remedies.</p><cb/>
                <p>Whatsoever those remedies may be, they will be well <lb/>administered by the judiciary, who possess a long-esta<lb break="no"/>blished course of investigation, effectual process, and offi<lb break="no"/>cers in the habit of executing it.</p>
                <p>In like manner, as several of the courts have doubted, <lb/>under particular circumstances, their power to liberate the <lb/>vessels of a nation at peace, and even of a citizen of the <lb/>United States, although seized under a false colour of be<lb break="no"/>ing hostile property; and have denied their power to liber<lb break="no"/>ate certain captures within the protection of our territo<lb break="no"/>ry; it would seem proper to regulate their jurisdiction in <lb/>these points. But if the executive is to be the resort in <lb/>either of the two last mentioned cases it is hoped that he will <lb/>be authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courts, when, for his own information, he shall request it.</p>
                <p>I can not recommend to your notice measures for the <lb/>fulfillment of our duties to the rest of the world, without a<lb break="no"/>gain pressing upon you the necessity of placing ourselves <lb/>in a condition of complete defense, and of exacting from <lb/><hi rend="italic">them</hi>  the fulfillment of <hi rend="italic">their</hi>  duties toward <hi rend="italic">us</hi>. The U<lb break="no"/>nited States ought not to indulge a persuasion, that, con<lb break="no"/>trary to the order of human events, they will for ever <lb/>keep at a distance those painful appeals to arms, with <lb/>which the history of every other nation abounds. There <lb/>is a rank due to the United States among nations, which <lb/>will be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult, we must be <lb/>able to repel it; If we desire to secure peace, one of the <lb/>most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it <lb/>must be known that we are at all times ready for war. <lb/>The documents which will be presented to you will shew <lb/>the amount, and kinds of arms and military stores now <lb/>in our magazines and arsenals; and yet an addition even <lb/>to these supplies cannot with prudence be neglected, as it <lb/>would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuring a <lb/>warlike apparatus in the moment of public danger.</p>
                <p>Nor can such arrangements, with such objects, be ex<lb break="no"/>posed to the censure or jealousy of the warmest friends of <lb/>Republican Government. They are incapable of abuse <lb/>in the hands of the militia, who ought to possess a pride <lb/>in being the depository of the force of the Republic, and <lb/>may be trained to a degree of energy equal to every mi<lb break="no"/>litary exigency of the United States. But it is an en<lb break="no"/>quiry which cannot be too solemnly pursued, whether <lb/>the act, "more effectually to provide for the national <lb/>defense by establishing an uniform militia throughout <lb/>the United States," has organized them so as to produce <lb/>their full effect; whether your own experience in the se<lb break="no"/>veral States has not detected some imperfections in the <lb/>scheme; and whether a material feature in an improve<lb break="no"/>ment of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity for <lb/>the study of those branches of the military art which can <lb/>scarcely ever be attained by practice alone.</p>
                <p>The connection of the United States with Europe has <lb/>become extremely interesting. The occurrences which <lb/>relate to it ,and have passed under the knowledge of the <lb/>Executive, will be exhibited to Congress in a subsequent <lb/>communication.</p>
                <p>When we contemplate the war on our frontiers, it <lb/>may be truly affirmed that every reasonable effort has <lb/>been made to adjust the causes of dissension with the In<lb break="no"/>dians north of the Ohio. The instructions given to the <lb/>Commissioners evince a moderation and equity; proceed<lb break="no"/>ing from a sincere love of peace, and a liberality, having <lb/>no restriction but the essential interests and dignity of the <lb/>United States. The attempt, however, of an amicable <lb/>negotiation having been frustrated, the troops have <lb/>marched to act offensively. Although the proposed <lb/>treaty did not arrest the progress of military preparation, <lb/>it is doubtful how far the advance of the season, before <lb/>good faith justified active movements, may retard them, <lb/>during the remainder of the year. From the papers <lb/>and intelligence, which relate to this important subject, <cb/> you will determine whether the deficiency in the number <lb/>of troops granted by law shall be compensated by suc<lb break="no"/>cors of militia, or additional encouragements shall be proposed to recruits.</p>
                <p>An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Execu<lb break="no"/>tive for peace with the Creeks and the Cherokees. The for<lb break="no"/>mer have been relieved with corn and with clothing, and <lb/>offensive measures against them prohibited <lb/>during the recess of Congress. To satisfy the complaints of the <lb/>latter, prosecutions have been instituted for the violences <lb/>committed upon them. But the papers which will be <lb/>delivered to you, disclose the critical footing on which <lb/>we stand in regard to both those tribes; and it is with Congress to pronounce what shall be done.</p>
                <p> After they shall have provided for the present emer<lb break="no"/>gency, it will merit their most serious labours to render <lb/>tranquillity with the savages permanent, by creating ties <lb/>of interest. Next to a rigorous execution of justice <lb/>on the violators of peace, the establishment of commerce <lb/>with the Indian nations in behalf of the United States, <lb/>is most likely to conciliate their attachment. But it <lb/>ought to be conducted without fraud, without extortion; with constant and plentiful supplies; with a ready mar<lb break="no"/>ket for the commodities of the Indians, and a stated price <lb/>for what they give in payment and receive in exchange. <lb/>Individuals will not pursue such a traffic, unless they be <lb/>allured by the hope of profit; but it will be enough for <lb/>the United States to be reimbursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the opinion of Congress, <lb/>they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by any <lb/>means yet in the hands of the Executive.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center">GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF  <lb/>REPRESENTATIVES,</hi></p>
                <p> The commissioners charged with the settlement of the <lb/>accounts between the United and Individual States con<lb break="no"/>cluded their important function within the limited time <lb/>by law; and the balances struck in their report, which <lb/>will be laid before congress, have been placed on the books <lb/>of the Treasury.</p>
                <p>On the 1st day of June last, an installment of on mil<lb break="no"/>lion of florins became payable on the loans of the United <lb/>States in Holland. This was adjusted by a prolongation <lb/>of the period of reimbursement, in nature of a new loan, <lb/>at an interest of five per cent. for the term of ten years; <lb/>and the expenses of this operation were a commission of <lb/>three per cent.</p>
                <p>The first installment of the loan of two millions of <lb/>dollars from the Bank of the United States, has been paid, <lb/>as was directed by law. For the second it is necessary <lb/>that provision be made.</p>
                <p>No pecuniary consideration is more urgent, than the <lb/>redemption and discharge of the public debt: On none <lb/>can delay be more injurious, or an economy of time <lb/>more valuable.</p>
                <p>The productiveness of the public revenues hitherto, <lb/>has continued to equal the anticipations which were form<lb break="no"/>ed of it; but it is not expected to prove <lb/>commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested. Some <lb/>auxiliary provisions will therefore, it is presumed, be re<lb break="no"/>quisite: and it is hoped that these may be made consis<lb break="no"/>tently with a due regard to the convenience of ourcitizens <lb/>who can not but be sensible of the true wisdom of encoun<lb break="no"/>tering a small present addition to their contributions to <lb/>obviate a future accumulation of burdens.</p>
                <p>But here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of <lb/>the tax on the transportation of public prints. There <lb/>is no resource so firm for the government of the United States as the affections of the People guided by an enligh<lb break="no"/>tened policy; and to this primary good, nothing can <lb/>conduce more than a faithful representation of public <lb/>proceedings, diffused, without restraint, throughout the United States. An estimate of the appropriations necessary for the <pb n="2"/> current service of the ensuing year and a statement of a <lb/>purchase of arms and military stores, made during the re<lb break="no"/>cess will be presented to Congress.</p>
                <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE <lb/>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                <p> The several subjects, to which I have now referred, o<lb break="no"/>pen a wide range to your deliberations and involve <lb/>some of the choicest interests of our common country. Permit <lb/>me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude of your <lb/>task:–Without an unprejudiced coolness, the welfare of <lb/>the government may be hazarded; without harmony, as <lb/>far as consists with freedom of sentiment, its dignity may <lb/>be lost.–But as the legislative proceedings of the United <lb/>States will never, I trust, be reproached for the want of <lb/>temper or of candour, so shall not the public happiness lan<lb break="no"/>guish from the want of my strenuous and warmest cooperation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="right">GEORGE WASHINGTON.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italc">Philadelphia, Dec</hi>. 3, 1793</p>
                <p>The President having withdrawn, the Members <lb/>of the House of Representatives returned to their <lb/>Chamber, where the President's Address was read, <lb/>and referred to a Committee to report the draft of an answer.</p>
                <p>A Committee was then appointed to report the unfinished business of the last House.–Adjourned.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Thursday, Dec</hi>. 5.</hi></p>
                <p>The Journal of the Commissioners for treating <lb/>with the Indians was read. It is minute and leng<lb break="no"/>thy. The definitive answer of the Indians contains <lb/>their reasons for rejecting the proposals of the <lb/>Commissioners, drawn up in a masterly manner, it <lb/>bears all the appearance of EUropean logic, faintly <lb/>clad in an Indian dress. All the documents relative <lb/>to this business were referred to a Committee of <lb/>the whole on the state of the Union.</p>
                <p>A message was received from the President, com<lb break="no"/>munication sundry papers relative to our European <lb/>relations, and also the result of the proceedings of <lb/>the Commissioners appointed to settle the accounts <lb/>of the United States with the Individual States.</p>
                <p>The first set of papers is introduced by a message, <lb/>of which the following is a copy:</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">United States</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Dec</hi>. 5, 1793  <lb/>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE  <lb/>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</hi></p>
                <p>As the present situations of the several nations of <lb/>Europe, and especially of those with whom the United <lb/>States have important relations, cannot but render the <lb/>state of things between them and us; matter of interest <lb/>ing enquiry to the Legislature, and may indeed give rise <lb/>to deliberations to which they alone are competent, I <lb/>have thought it my duty to communicate them certain <lb/>correspondencies which have taken place.</p>
                <p>The Representatives and Executive Bodies of France <lb/>have manifested generally a friendly attachment to this <lb/>country; have given advantages to our commerce and <lb/>navigation, and have made overtures for placing these <lb/>advantages on permanent ground; a decree however of <lb/>the National Assembly, subjecting vessels laden with pro<lb break="no"/>visions to be carried into their ports and making enemy <lb/>goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend, contrary to <lb/>our treaty, though revoked at one time, as to the United <lb/>States, has been since extended to their vessels also, as has <lb/>been recently stated to us. Representations on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject will be immediately given in charge to our Minister <lb/>there, and the result shall be communicated to the Legi<lb break="no"/>slature.</p>
                <p>It is with extreme concern I have to inform you, that <lb/>the proceedings of the person whom they have unfortunately appointed their Minister Plenipotentiary here have <lb/>breathed nothing of the friendly spirit of that nation <lb/>which sent him; their tendency on the contrary has been <lb/>to involve us in a war abroad; and discord and anarchy <lb/>at home. So far as his acts or those of his agents, have <lb/>threatened our immediate commitment in the war, or <lb/>flagrant insult to the authority of the laws, their effect <lb/>has been counteracted by the ordinary cognizance of the <lb/>laws, and by an exertions of the powers confided to me. <lb/>Where their danger was not imminent, they have been <lb/>born with, from sentiments of regard to his nation, from <lb/>a sense of their friendship towards us, from a conviction <lb/>that they would not suffer us to remain long exposed to <cb/> the action of a person who has so little respectedour mu <lb/>tual dispositions, and, I will add, from a reliance on the <lb/>firmness of my fellow citizens in their principles of peace <lb/>and order. In the mean time, I have respected and pur<lb break="no"/>sued the stipulations of our treaties, according to what I <lb/>judge the true sense; and have withheld no act of <lb/>friendship which their affairs have called for from us, and <lb/>which justice to others let us free to perform. I have gone <lb/>further;–rather than employ force for the restitution of <lb/>certain vessels which I deemed the United States bound to <lb/>restore, I thought it more advisable to satisfy the parties, <lb/>by avowing it to be my opinion, that if restitution were <lb/>not made, it would be incumbent on the United States <lb/>to make compensation. The papers now communicated <lb/>will more particularly apprize you of these transactions.</p>
                <p>The vexations and spolitation understood to have been <lb/>committed on our vessels and commerce by the cruizers <lb/>and officers of some of the belligerent powers, appeared to <lb/>require attention. The proofs of these however not hav<lb break="no"/>ing been brought forward, the description of citizens sup<lb break="no"/>posed to have suffered were notified, that on furnishing <lb/>them to the Executive Power, due measures would be <lb/>taken to obtain redress of the past, and more effectual provisions against the future. Should such documents <lb/>be furnished ,proper representations will be made thereon, <lb/>with a just resistance on a redress proportioned to eh ex<lb break="no"/>igency of the case.</p>
                <p>The BRitish Government having undertaken by orders <lb/>to the commanders of their armed vessels to restrain ge<lb break="no"/>nerally our commerce in corn and other provisions to their <lb/>own ports and those of their friends, the instructions now <lb/>communicated were immediately forwarded to our Mi<lb break="no"/>nister at that court. In the mean time, some discussions<lb break="no"/>on the subject took place between him and them; these <lb/>are also laid before you; and I may expect to learn the <lb/>result of his special instructions in time to make it known <lb/>to the legislature during their present sessions.</p>
                <p>Very early after the arrival of a British Minister here, <lb/>mutual explanation on the execution of the Treaty of <lb/>Peace were entered into with that Minister; these are <lb/>now laid before you for your information.</p>
                <p>On the subjects of mutual interest between this coun<lb break="no"/>try and Spain, negociations and conferences are now de<lb break="no"/>pending. The public requiring that the present state of those should be made known to the legislature in con<lb break="no"/>fidence only, they shall be the subject of a separate and <lb/>subsequent communication.</p>

                <p>Mr. Madison reported the draft of an Answer <lb/>to the Address of the President.</p>
