                <p>The accounts received on Tuesday from the Cape of <lb/>Good Hope are to the 17th April, which are consi<lb break="no"/>derably later than those previously received.</p>
                <p>Information has just reached Cape Town, that a <lb/>detachment of troops, joined by a number of the inha<lb break="no"/>bitants, who had been sent to suppress the Caffres, had <lb/>succeeded in driving them back, and were compelled to <lb/>cross the river. The corn districts were in a great <lb/>measure cleared of the savages, and the country-people <lb/>were returning to their homes, where they considered <lb/>themselves secure from any further attacks, at least for <lb/>some time to come.</p>
                <p>Letters have just been received, via Calcutta, from <lb/>New South Walves, up to the end of November. The <lb/>colony was then all well, and several convict-ships (the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Marley, Glory, Mario, Isabella,</hi>  and others) had ar<lb break="no"/>rived, having made the passage out direct in the short <lb/>period of three months and twenty days, and landed <lb/>all their convicts and passengers in good health. This <lb/>may be considered as another, among many proofs, that <lb/>it is unnecessary to make any stay at any intermediate <lb/>port.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Extract of a letter from Sierra Leone, dated </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">January 9</hi></p>
                <p>"It is with the deepest regret I inform you, that <lb/>notwithstanding the liberality of Great Britain, and the <lb/>faith of treaties solemnly entered into, this coast swarms <lb/>with slave vessels, drugging thousands of its miserable <lb/>inhabitants into endless captivity. A few days ago <lb/>arrived here the Union, of Liverpool : the supercargo <lb/>states, that during his stay in the River Calaba, not less <lb/>than eight vessels, averaging 500 slaves each, had sail<lb break="no"/>ed for the Spanish Collective."</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">" Montreal, May 11</hi></p>
                <p>"We learn there are about 70 souls, mostly Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, preparing to set out from this place, the 25th <lb/>inst. for Lord Selkirk's settlement on the River Rouge. <lb/>The number of settlers there at this time, it is said <lb/>amount to about 590. An intelligent Canadian, in <lb/>easy circumstances with whom we conversed, and who <lb/>goes thither with the before-mentioned settlers, with <lb/>all his family, says he passed a winter there when en<lb break="no"/>gaged in this for trade and reports it to be a fertile <lb/>country, and the climate much milder than that of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada. Thus, there is every appearance, that this Co<lb break="no"/>lony, in the course of time, will become populous and <lb/>flourishing."</p>
