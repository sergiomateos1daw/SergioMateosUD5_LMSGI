                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">To the Editor of the Edinburgh Weekly Journal</hi></p>
                <p>SIR–It will be remember by many of your Readers, that, in the spring of 1815, proclamations were widely circulated, inviting settlers to Canada.–Having myself occasion <lb/>to visit this country, I was curious to know what had been the result, especially as I found at Quebec and Montreal very discordant accounts respecting it ; most people asserting <lb/>that the scheme had failed of success, and that the settlers were in a state of great discomfort and discontent.–To ascertain the truth, I diverged from my route about 50 miles, and <lb/>spent some days at Perth, situated on the waters of the Redeau, to which a considerable body of the people who accepted the invitation of the Government had been conducted.– <lb/>Here it traced the reported discontent to some neglect in the general management, and some ill conceieved petty regulations, capriciously exercised towards people tenacious of their rights ; <lb/>but in the main, universal satisfaction prevailed among the settlers, and a strong feeling of the good intentions of Government towards them. The opportunity being a good one of ascer<lb break="no"/>taining the progress which a promiscious body of settlers make in a given time. I constructed the annexed table, and had each man's signature attached, at once to prove to correctness <lb/>of his statement, and satisfaction with his situation. Should you think this worthy of publication, you are welcome to publish it in your paper. It may draw attention of a most important <lb/>subject–the colonization of this province with British subjects ; and it may afford satisfaction to many individuals who may not otherwise know the condition of their friends. The <lb/>scheme which Government adopted in 1815 was expensive. The settlers had a free passage, rations and tools. Next year rations and tools were furnished to those who came out ; <lb/>and this year multitudes of poor people have come to Canada, in expectation of being favoured in the same way, but are disappointed ; having nothing given them but land (100 acres <lb/>each), which many of them from poverty are unable to occupy. Having made it my study, during three months residence here, to inquire into the nature of the country, and into every <lb/>particular respecting settlement, I am convinced that very simple measures might be adopted, by which the redundant population of Britain could be conveyed by a regular flow into <lb/>Canada, instead of being wasted, as it now is, to the great prejudice of British interest, over the whole of American ; and were such measures adopted, this province would, in a very <lb/>few years, be quite equal to its defence in war against the United States –I am, Sir, yours, &amp;c. <lb/>Upper Canada, September 15. 1817 <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert Gourlay.</hi></p>
