                <p>Advices have been received again from the Cape of <lb/>Good Hope of 6th March, which are several days later <lb/>than those acquired formerly. Of the rising of the <lb/>Caffres there remains no doubt, although it does <lb/>not appear that Government have as yet received of<lb break="no"/>ficial information regarding it. The private accounts <lb/>state that two valuable officers had lost their lives, and <lb/>also a great number of men. The Governor himself <lb/>in order by his presence the sooner to suppress the Caf<lb break="no"/>fres, had, with a competent force, proceeded to the in<lb break="no"/>terior. Great inconvenience was experienced for the <lb/>want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not this <lb/>been the case, it was believed that in a very few days <lb/>tranquility would have been restored.</p>
                <p>We are sorry to state that another hurricane has ta<lb break="no"/>ken place in the Isle of France ; it commenced on the <lb/>25th January, and has done great mischief to the ship<lb break="no"/>ping, and also to the plantations of that ill-fated Is<lb break="no"/>land.</p>
                <p>A Dutch mail has arrived, with papers to the 19th <lb/>inst. At Batavia, two of the leaders of the late distur<lb break="no"/>bances have been tried and execute, and that degree <lb/>of tranquility which terror produces has been restored. <lb/>In the administration of their colonies in the east, the <lb/>conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and op<lb break="no"/>pressive ; and it is to be regretted that the extensive <lb/>and fertile island of Java should have been surrendered <lb/>to their rapacity. During the short time that it was in <lb/>possession of this country, various important improve<lb break="no"/>ments were introduced into its domestic administration ; <lb/>the practise of torture, according to the humane and <lb/>enlightened maxims of British jurisprudence, was abo<lb break="no"/>lished ; new and better modes of collecting the revenue <lb/>were adopted ; and a spirit of mildness and of regard <lb/>for the interests of all the various classes of which the <lb/>population is composed, was evinced, which made the <lb/>British Government highly popular.</p>
                <p>Considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants <lb/>for the safety of the Queen Charlotte, Jamaica packet. <lb/>She sailed from Jamaica the 29th March, and had a <lb/>great quantity of specie on board. No things have <lb/>since been received of her. Several vessels sailed since <lb/>her departure, and have arrived safe. The Ocean quit<lb break="no"/>ted Jamaica on the 6th of April, and arrived here se<lb break="no"/>veral days since.</p>
                <p>Several passengers landed at Portsmouth on Thurs<lb break="no"/>day from Jamaica, bring Port Royal Papers to the <lb/>25th of March. The 50th Regiment had arrived at <lb/>Kingston, from Cork ; and the 2nd West India Regi<lb break="no"/>ment was about to embark for Sierra Leone to be dis<lb break="no"/>banded.</p>
