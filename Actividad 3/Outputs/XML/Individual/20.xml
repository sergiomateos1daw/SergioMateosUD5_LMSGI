                <p> <lb/><hi rend="enlarged-capital">O</hi> N Saturday last between three and four <lb/>o'clock, P. M. happened the most violent <lb/>hurricane pest, or thunder storm (for we are at <lb/>a lost to determine its proper name) that was <lb/>ever known in this borough or its vicinity. We <lb/>can conceive of nothing but an earthquake, that <lb/>could be attended with more alarming circum<lb break="no"/>stances. The cloud from the west, or rather a <lb/>number of clouds of a lowering aspect, furiously <lb/>agitated, broken, and seemingly ready to fall– <lb/>attracted the attention, and prepared the mind <lb/>in some measure for what was to follow. The <lb/>lightening appeared to those who were at a dis<lb break="no"/>tance, remarkably red, and seemed to flash from <lb/>the cloud to the earth and back again, in quick <lb/>succession or some time, as to appear one sheet <lb/>of flame. This might have had a great effect on <lb/>the air, at some miles distance from town, to set <lb/>it in rapid motion, especially when pressed down <lb/>by a heavy cloud suddenly falling towards the <lb/>earth. A very considerable quantity of hail fell; <lb/>and the rain was so abundant that it seemed as <lb/>thrown from buckets, and being carried along <lb/>and dashed against every opposing object by a <lb/>most impetuous wind, darkened the air in such a <lb/>manner, that all surrounding objects seemed lost <lb/>in night. The storm threatened to lay the whole <lb/>town in ruins, with such irresistible force did the <lb/>column of air move on: happily however, the da<lb break="no"/>mages were much less than apprehended. The <lb/>The new brick house belonging to the Rev. Dr. Da<lb break="no"/>vidson, being an an elevated spot near the west <lb/>end of the town, and lying directly in the line of <lb/>march of this powerful column, was the first suf<lb break="no"/>ferer; all the parts of the building above the square <lb/>were suddenly borne off, and a great part of the <lb/>roof was carried over Mr. Paton's house, which <lb/>stood at a small distance on the east, striking it <lb/>forcibly, and injuring it greatly in its ways, and <lb/>fell on the adjoining lot. Mr. Paton's house is <lb/>left in much the same condition as the Doctor's. <lb/>After injruing some smaller buildings in its course <lb/>to the eastward, the next elevated object to which <lb/>it pointed its fury, was the presbyterian church <lb/>in the certain of town–a building of uncom<lb break="no"/>mon solidity, calculated, it was thought, to stand <lb/>for ages, admist all the war of the elements. A<lb break="no"/>bout a fourth part, however of the roof of the <lb/>north side was carried off, with the weighty cor<lb break="no"/>nice, and thrown to the ground at some hundred <lb/>yards distance on the east side of the open square <lb/>which is in the centre of this borough. After <lb/>leaving the town it beat its course to the public <lb/>buildings, and greatly injured that range nearest <lb/>the town. Many fences in the neighbourhood, <lb/>which were in the line of its direction, were also <lb/>thrown down; but how far it extended, or what <lb/>damages the farmers may have sustained we have <lb/>not yet learned. Let it, however, not be forgot<lb break="no"/>ten, that dreadful as the scene was, through the <lb/>good providence of God, not a single life was <lb/>lost or any personal injury, worth mentioning, <cb/>received, and the buildings, it is hoped, will soon <lb/>be restored to as good a state as they were in be<lb break="no"/>fore.</p>
