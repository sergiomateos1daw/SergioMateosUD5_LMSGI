                <p><pb n="6"/>Letters from Alexandria, in Virginia, dated <lb/>the 9th May last, mention, that General Wayne <lb/>had been dispatched, in the beginning of March, <lb/>on an expedition against the Cherokee Miamis <lb/>and Chickesau Indians, who have, for some time <lb/>past, had as their chief warrior, one Macgillivray, <lb/>a Scotchman, who has long resided among these <lb/>Indians. General Wayne, at the head of two <lb/>thousand Provincials, had completely routed them <lb/>after a great slaughter. After the battle, Mac<lb break="no"/>gillivray and his savages took refuge in the woods. <lb/>General Wayne has destroyed the most part of <lb/>the habitation of these Indians in the extent of <lb/>200 English miles along the river, which is the <lb/>boundary of Georgia, after which he returned to <lb/>Savannah. This defeat is so total, that it will put <lb/>it out of the power of these Indians to be again <lb/>troublesome to the State of Virginia.</p>
