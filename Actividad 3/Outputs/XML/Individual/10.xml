                <p>We left Patia Dec. 15, 1789, and went to <lb/>Decca, and arrived there after a passage of 16 <lb/>days. Just as we arrived there was a famine, <lb/>and it was really a shocking sight to behold; <lb/>you could not move out of your house but the <lb/>corpses lay in your way, and the wild dogs and <lb/>jackalls were eating them at noon-day. The <lb/>Hindoos never bury their dead, but burn them <lb/>to ashes, if they can afford it; if not, throw <lb/>them into the river. I have lately seen a man <lb/>brought to the river side, and laid down at low<lb break="no"/>water mark before he was dead ; and when the <lb/>the tide flowed, it carried him off. If a man, wo<lb break="no"/>man, or child, dies at night, the corpse is eaten <lb/>by the morning. This I have been an eye wit<lb break="no"/>ness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback <lb/>every morning, I had an opportunity of seeing <lb/>more than those that did not. In the course of <lb/>six months I became so much used to it, that I <lb/>took no notice of it.</p>
                <p>"I was there when a dreadful conflagration <lb/>took place, and burnt upwards of seven miles with<lb break="no"/>out intermission, and many souls perished. Now <lb/>consider, first, an inundation; second, a famine; <lb/>and third, a conflagration. How much the place <lb/>must be distressed, I leave you to think. I left <lb/>Decca the 1st of December last, and arrived at <lb/>Calcutta, after a passage through the Sunderburns <lb/>(in 17 days), hearty and well, thank God."</p>
