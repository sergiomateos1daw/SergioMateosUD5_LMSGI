                <p>The authenticity of the following details of the <lb/>miseries endured by some German emigrants <lb/>proceeding from Amsterdam to America is, we <lb/>are told, guaranteed ; otherwise they are almost <lb/>too shocking to admit to belief :</p>
                <p>"Libson, Nov. 4</p>
                <p>"We have just been witnesses here of an <lb/>event which has renewed those gloomy reflexions <lb/>which the friends of humanity have indulged ever <lb/>since the commencement of the emigration from <lb/>Germany and Switzerland to America. We have <lb/>deplored the error which led so great a number <lb/>of unhappy persons to expartiate themselves in <lb/>the hope of finding a happier lot upon the shores <lb/>of the new world. But it is less to the blindness <lb/>of the victims of this error, than to the abomi<lb break="no"/>nable speculations of cupidity that we are to <lb/>attribute these numerous emigrations.</p>
                <p>"the misery of the people of Germany and <lb/>Switzerland, occasioned by a superabundance of <lb/>population, and by the bad harvests of late years, <lb/>serves for aliment to the avarice of certain men, <lb/>who seek to establish criminal projects upon <lb/>bases almost as obnoxious as those of the former <lb/>slave trade. Such calculations deserve the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of Governments, and it is with this view that <lb/>we think is our duty to make known the fate of <lb/>an expedition of this kind, fitted out at Amster<lb break="no"/>dam last August.</p>
                <p>"But we shall first transcribe, from the ori<lb break="no"/>ginal, the article of the charter party relative to <lb/>the power reserved by the Captain over the per<lb break="no"/>sons of the passengers, as inlcuding stipulations <lb/>which are most characteristic of the nature of that <lb/>odious traffic :–</p>
                <p>"We passengers, promise to fulfil faithfully the follow<lb break="no"/>ing conditions:– With respect to the price of the passage <lb/>above stipulated, for so much as we have not yet paid, we en<lb break="no"/>gage to gain by our labour in America, what we owe, and we <lb/>who owe the whole amount of our passage are bound, if re<lb break="no"/>quired, and if we are unable to find better conditions, to hire <lb/>ourselves for four or five years, in order to pay for our pas<lb break="no"/>sage ; and we who have only paid for a part of our passage, <lb/>equally promise to let ourselves out to work for the same time <lb/>for the sum we still owe.</p>
                <p>"We promise besides, we passengers, men or women, fa<lb break="no"/>thers or mothers, children and families here assembled, the <lb/>children for their parents, the parents for their children, the <lb/>brother for his brother, and the sister for her sister, when <lb/>we shall find an opportunity to employ ourselves in America, <lb/>to engage ourselves in service, and to answer for one for the other <lb/>one for all the others, whether he be of our family or not, so <lb/>that the price of the passage be diminished or augmented as <lb/>much as shall be necessary, until we all and our families have <lb/>employment, and the captain be no loser by us ; knowing very <lb/>well that we passengers who have children, a family, brothers, <lb/>and sisters, ought all to sumbit to our wives or husbands, our <lb/>children, our brothers, our sisters, being sent separately to <lb/>whatever place, in order to gain, in private service, profession, <lb/>or labour, or in any manner that shall be deemed best, the <lb/>price of our passage ; and in order that we may not in any case <lb/>refused the engagements proposed to us, or contract others <lb/>without the permission not knowledge of the capain, it is agreed <lb/>for those who have not yet paid for their passage, for those <lb/>who still owe part, and for those who cannot find an en<lb break="no"/>gagement, that they must consent to me, the captain, carrying <lb/>them to such place in America as it shall please me, and <lb/>wherever I may find it expedient to proceed, or wherever it <lb/>may suit me to sail."</p>
                <p>"These horrible conditions were signed by <lb/>300 passengers. They had contracted with the <lb/>Captain of a Dutch ship, which was to proceed <lb/>first to Baltimore. She in the worst state <lb/>when she sailed from Amsterdam, and in de<lb break="no"/>fiance of the clauses of the contract, by which <lb/>the Captain had engaged to feed them properly <lb/>during the voyage, he had not even embarked <lb/>the necessary quanitity of provisions ; for, after <lb/>62 days navigation, the leaks had so gained upon <lb/>the ship, that she was in danger of sinking, and <lb/>famine had already made frightful ravages. It <lb/>was at the end of that time, and in this deplo <lb/>rable condition, that she was forced into Belem, <lb/>near Lisbon.</p>
                <p>"Long before her arrival on our coasts, the <lb/>passengers had been reduced to the greatest mi<lb break="no"/>sery, not more by the small quantity than by the <lb/>bad quality of the provisions. The water was <lb/>gone, and sea-water was their only drink. So <lb/>much had they been wasted, that forty had al<lb break="no"/>ready died of famine. Among the rest there <lb/>were a great many sick, some of who have died <lb/>since their arrival in Portugal.</p>
                <p>"The situation of the vessel had at first given <lb/>great alarm to our Council of Health, who, ap<lb break="no"/>prehensive of contagion, were for an instant fear<lb break="no"/>ful that it would be necessary to force her out <lb/>to sea. That would have been a misery so much <lb/>the more formidable, because the ship was not in <lb/>a state to keep the sea, and all must infallibly <lb/>have perished. Happily this was deemed unne<lb break="no"/>cessary, and a quarantine was ordered. The Re<lb break="no"/>gency of Lisbon determined that provisions and <lb/>other succours should be furnished at the ex<lb break="no"/>pence of the State. All the Consuls were most <lb/>active and benevolent in affording assistance.</p>
                <p>"Such was the result of the expedition. <lb/>Many others have, no doubt, answered as little <lb/>the expectations of those who, seduced by de<lb break="no"/>ceitful promises have emigrated to America in <lb/>search of happiness which they could not find, <lb/>abandoning their country, their parents, and <lb/>their friends. In July, a Hamburgh ship, with <lb/>106 Swiss passengers, was at Lisbon, in nearly the <lb/>same distress with the Dutch ship. It is said <lb/>here that there is a company in Holland which <lb/>has numerous agents to seduce men to emigrate. <lb/>It heaps them pell mell on board ships, and if <lb/>they reach their destination, they are soon con<lb break="no"/> <lb/>vinced of the fallacy of all their hopes.</p>
                <p>"It would be a desirable thing for papers, in <lb/>countries where these emigrations are excited, <lb/>to insert the article relative to the charter par<lb break="no"/>ty, given above, in order that the simple <lb/>and credulous may see what they have to un<lb break="no"/>dergo."</p>
