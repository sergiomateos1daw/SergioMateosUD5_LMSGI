                <p><pb n="1"/>American papers are received, dated October, 4. <lb/> 1794. They contain two letters from General <lb/> Wayne to the American Secretary at War, giving <lb/> an account of a severe action he had with the Indi<lb break="no"/> ans, who were assisted by the volunteers and militia <lb/> of Detroit on the 20th August, on the banks of <lb/> the Miamis, in the vicinity of the British post and <lb/> garrison at the foot of the Rapids.–The action <lb/> was bloody, and he says, "our army was left in <lb/> full and quiet possession of the field of battle, which <lb/> terminated under the influence of the guns of the <lb/> British garrison, as you will observe by the inclosed <lb/> <cb/> correspondence which passed between Major Camp<lb break="no"/> bell Commandant and myself upon the occasion." <lb/> He adds℃"We remained three days and nights <lb/> on the banks of the Miamis, in front of the field <lb/> of battle; during which time all the houses and <lb/> corn fields were consumed and destroyed for a con<lb break="no"/> siderable distance both above and below Fork Mia<lb break="no"/> mis, as well as within pistol shot of that garrison, <lb/> who were compelled to remain tacit spectators to <lb/> this general devastation and conflagration, among <lb/> which were the stores and houses of Colonel Mac<lb break="no"/> kee, the British Indian agent and principal stimu<lb break="no"/> lator of the war now exiting between the United <lb/> States and the Savages.</p>
                <p> The American paper from which this account <lb/> is taken, does not give the correspondence above <lb/> alluded to, but concludes the article thus: <lb/></p>
                <p>"Besides the very important papers which we <lb/> have been able to offer to our readers this day, the <lb/> Executive, we understand, has received copies of a <lb/> correspondence between the British Major Camp<lb break="no"/> bell, and General Wayne. The Major begins it <lb/> by inquiring of the General by what authority he <lb/> came there. The General answers by requiring <lb/> to know who gave Campbell authority to establish <lb/> a fort at that place, it being within our side of the <lb/> treaty boundary, and no such establishment there <lb/> when that instrument was signed. We hope ere <lb/> long our gallant General will give a good account <lb/> of this Mr. Campbell."</p>
