                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Every thing is jobbed </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Female Emigration to Australia, &amp;c. </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">(From a Correspondent.)</hi></p>
                <p>Our penal settlements appear to be very indifferent<lb break="no"/>ly managed; and we are glad to find that such a man <lb/>as Sir John Franklin is appointed to govern Van Die<lb break="no"/>men's Land; and the sooner an improved system is <lb/>adopted for New South Wales, the better. Not only <lb/>are men sent out to govern who are ignorant of human <lb/>nature, a knowledge of which is essential to the manage<lb break="no"/>ment of the heterogenous materials of our penal colo<lb break="no"/>nies; but when the Government at home opens its eyes <lb/>to any proposal for improvement,it is mismanaged. Our <lb/>rulers have the sense to see the importance of sending <lb/>our respectable females to these colonies ; but they trust <lb/>an Emigration Committee, and this committee trusts <lb/>individuals who desire to make the most of the con<lb break="no"/>cern ; and we are glad to have an opportunity of mak<lb break="no"/>ing the public acquainted with the mode in which <lb/>the business is conducted, in the hope that some hu<lb break="no"/>mane Member of Parliament will take the subject <lb/>up. The mode of managing female emigration is <lb/>this :â€“</p>
                <p>A temptation, in the first place, is held out of a <lb/>free passage to Australia. A ship is hired, and this <lb/>ship must ave a <hi rend="italic">full</hi>  cargo, to satisfy the <hi rend="italic">owners. </hi><lb/>Advertisements are issued, and instead of hard work<lb break="no"/>ing females, a parcel of decayed governesses, dress<lb break="no"/>makers, &amp;c. &amp;c., with a small mixture of better <lb/>articles, is made up. But if, as almost always hap<lb break="no"/>pens, a sufficient number of these to fill the ship <lb/>does not come forward, a supply of sweepings <lb/>is taken from a workhouse! Here, then, is such a <lb/>mixture of good, bad, and indifferent, to the amount <lb/>of two hundred and upwards, that there is enough <lb/>of evil to corrupt the good. As to the comfort of the <lb/>poor creatures they are crammed <hi rend="smallcaps">four into one </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">bed</hi>  !</p>
                <p>Such is the power of jobbing, that we happen to <lb/>know the fact, that some young women of respectabi<lb break="no"/>lity who wished to go to New South Wales <hi rend="italic">with their </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">friends</hi>, were refused a free passage, unless they went <lb/>to London to go in the Government ship ! Thus we <lb/>see that the interests of agents and shipowners over<lb break="no"/>comes the interests of the colonies, and actually ob<lb break="no"/>structs the attainment of the object in view. We find <lb/>blindness a very common ailment in every department <lb/>of Government ; and however desirous our rulrs may <lb/>be to reform every abuse, and to adopt useful mea<lb break="no"/>sures, they are often thwarted by the necessity (which <lb/>ought not to exist) of conciliating harpies and leeches, <lb/>which devour the public substance, and suck the pub<lb break="no"/>lic blood. Reform has, as yet, only begun to clean <lb/>the outside of the platter ; and it may not reach the <lb/>inside in our day. It is the duty, however, of all pa<lb break="no"/>triots, to sharpen the knife that is to cut out corruption <lb/>from the heart of the commonwealth, by means of ex<lb break="no"/>posure of every abuse that comes to be known, and to <lb/>support those who are willing to apply it.</p>
                <p>As in a matter of so much importance nothing <lb/>should be concealed, there is no hesitation in stating <lb/>that it consists with our knowledge that, after the <lb/>Emigration Committee in Van Diemen's Land, detail<lb break="no"/>ing the deplorable consequences of sending out young <lb/>women from workhouses, a ship has actually sailed, <lb/>nearly filled up as we have described. When any <lb/>representation is made to a public office, the matter is <lb/>said to belong to another department ; and that other <lb/>department says it is not its province to interfere ; and <lb/>thus humanity is made the shuttlecock to the battle<lb break="no"/>dore of jobbing and the blindness of office.</p>
                <p>If our brethren of the press will take up this, the <lb/>inhuman job will be put an end to.</p>
