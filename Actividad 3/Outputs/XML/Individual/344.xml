                <p><pb n="2"/><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Kingston, Feb</hi>. 6.</hi></p>
                <p>By a St. Christopher's paper of the 25th ult. <lb/>we learn, that the small-pox raged lately at &gt;Su<lb break="no"/>rinam, to such a degree that, within the space of <lb/>two months, upwards of 2500 persons had perish<lb break="no"/>ed by that disorder.</p>
                <p>A very severe shock of an earthquake was felt <lb/>between give and six on the evening of last Thurs<lb break="no"/>day se'ennight, at the settlements near the Blue <lb/>Mountains.</p>
                <p>On Wednesday the 3d instant, arrived at Luc<lb break="no"/>ca, the ship Pitt, Captain Hunter, from Africa <lb/>with154 Gold-Coast Negroes. On the passage <lb/>from Africa, nine of the seamen mutined, whom <lb/>Captain Hunter has brought confined in irons, <lb/>and they are to be tried at a Court of Admiral<lb break="no"/>ty Sessions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Feb</hi>. 20. Very strong suspicions are entertain<lb break="no"/>ed by the Americans, that the Indian Chief M' <lb/>Gilveray, and the nations under his immediate <lb/>controul, or in alliance with him, are subsidied <lb/>by the King of Spain. It is a well known fact, <lb/>that they are regularly supplied with cloathing, <lb/>arms and ammunition, from the Royal Maga<lb break="no"/>zines at St. Augustine and Pensacola, and there<lb break="no"/>fore in all probability; the sword not the olive <lb/>branch, will be the most speedy and effectual <lb/>agent for terminating the disputes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">March</hi>  6. Tuesday last arrived in the harbour <lb/>of Port Royal, from Cork, his Majesty's ship <lb/>Chichester, of 44 guns, armed <hi rend="italic">en flute</hi>, Lieute<lb break="no"/>nant Craven, Commander, having on board the <lb/>first battalion of the first or Royal Regiment of <lb/>of foot, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Dundas. <lb/>The other Officers are–Captains, Duncan, Fra<lb break="no"/>ner, Pemberton, and Mannoch; Lieutenants, <lb/>Sir W. Jas. Cockburne, Bart. Nicholson, Pux<lb break="no"/>ley, Clunes, Browne, Clarke, Drummond, and <lb/>Graham; Adjutant, Sir. W. J. Cockburne, Bart. <lb/>Quartermaster, Mr. Davidson, Surgeon, MR. <lb/>Young; Ma<supplied reason="copy blur">?</supplied>e, Mr. Bolton.</p>
                <p>The troops in the Chicester amount to 500 <lb/>men, exch<supplied reason="copy blur">??</supplied>e of 100 women and children.</p>
                <p>Colonel Hunter is appointed superintendent of <lb/>the settlement at the Bay of Honduras, in the <lb/>room of Colonel Despard, recalled.</p>
                <p>Col. Hunter came out with the earl of Effing<lb break="no"/>ham; it is therefore probable that the dis<lb break="no"/>putes which have so long subsisted between Lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of <lb/>the Bay of Honoduras, will be brought to a speedy <lb/>determination.</p>
                <p>At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's e<lb break="no"/>state,a negro blacksmith was sold for the extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary sum of two hundred and sixty pounds!</p>
                <p>At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d <lb/>regiment quitted the barracks in this town and <lb/>at Up Park Camp, and embarked on board the <lb/>Chichester for Great Britain; the 14th at the <lb/>same time taking possession of their quarters.</p>
                <p>Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispani<lb break="no"/>ola, that, on the 1st of this month, a number of <lb/>free people of colour, to the amount of 700 and <lb/>upwards, having possessed themselves of several <lb/>field pieces, formed a camp in that districh, and <lb/>exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarm<lb break="no"/>ing. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent <lb/>from the Assembly to demand the reason of so <lb/>extraordinary a proceeding, the insurgents de<lb break="no"/>manded, that a remonstrance which they then <lb/>delivered to the deputies, should be presented im<lb break="no"/>immediately to the general, and that an answer <lb/>thereto should be given without delay. The pa<lb break="no"/>per being conveyed as they desired, proved to be <lb/>a sensible and well written detail of the various <lb/>claims the free people of colour had on what they <lb/>termed the justice of the whites, with whom they <lb/>demanded an equal participation of all rights and <pb n="3"/> immunities whatsoever–the privilege of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation, and of qualifying for all the learned <lb/>professions–and concluding with the avowal of <lb/>a determination to proceed to extremities should <lb/>their demands be treat with neglect.</p>
                <p>On the perusal of this paper, it was judged ad<lb break="no"/>viseable to assemble a body of the militia, who <lb/>headed by the General, immediately went against <lb/>the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired <lb/>and fled to the mountains; three or four of the <lb/>whites were killed, and one of the ringleaders was <lb/>taken and instantly beheaded.</p>
                <p>A proclamation was then issued, offering a re<lb break="no"/>ward of 50 half joes for the head of any principal <lb/>offender, and in the course of a few days not less <lb/>than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday <lb/>the 7th instant, a very great majority of those <lb/>who had formed the camp, finding all their at<lb break="no"/>tempts completely frustrated, came in and took <lb/>the oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two <lb/>of the principals, for whom high rewards are of<lb break="no"/>fered, are not yet taken.</p>
                <p>From Port Maria we have received the disagree<lb break="no"/>able account of the loss of the ship Lion, Capt. <lb/>Smith, belonging to Liverpool: a violent breeze <lb/>on the 5th instant drove her from her anchors, <lb/>and she now lies stranded on the beach.</p>
