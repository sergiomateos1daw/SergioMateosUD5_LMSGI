                <p>" <hi rend="smallcaps">Quebec</hi>, March 23, 1810.–A number of <lb/>leading characters among the Canadians, who were <lb/>Members of the House of Assembly (twice dissol<lb break="no"/>ved for improper conduct) and the proprietor of a <lb/>French paper, called <hi rend="italic">La Canadien</hi>, have been arrest<lb break="no"/>ed and thrown into jail, upon a charge of treason<lb break="no"/>able and seditious practises ; the printing press, types, <lb/>&amp;c. also taken possession of. This vigorous mea<lb break="no"/>sure of Sir James Craig, has astonished the Cana<lb break="no"/>dians not a little, but the consequences will be no <lb/>doubt beneficial to the country, as it has crushed a <lb/>faction which has for some years been gaining <lb/>strength, and acquiring dangerous influence over the <lb/>minds of the inhabitants, who are without education, <lb/>and ignorant, of course, in the extreme ; therefore <lb/>easily misled by demagogues among their country<lb break="no"/>men, who seize every opportunity of stirring up all <lb/>those prejudices which the people of this country <lb/>naturally have against the British : for, having been <lb/>allowed to preserve their language, they are nearly <lb/>as much Frenchmen now as they were at the con<lb break="no"/>quest."</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Quebec</hi>, March 22.–On Sunday afternoon, the <lb/>printer of the <hi rend="italic">Canadien</hi>, Mr Charles Lafrancois <lb/>was arrested and committed to jail, under a warrant <lb/>from the Executive Council, on a charge of treason<lb break="no"/>able practises. On Monday evening, Dr Blanchet <lb/>and Mr Bedard, and last evening Mr T. Taschereau, <lb/>were also arrested, and committed by the same au<lb break="no"/>thority on the same charges.</p>
                <p>The Commander in Chief in Scotland gave an e<lb break="no"/>legant dinner, at head-quarters, on the 4th curt. to <lb/>celebrate the King's birthday-day–at which several of <lb/>the Nobility and Gentry, Generals, and Field-Offi<lb break="no"/>cers of the army, were present.</p>
                <p>Among the other accidents that occurred on the <lb/>King's birth-day, from the imprudent use of gun<lb break="no"/>powder, is the death of girl in Richmond Street.– <lb/>Her clothes were set fire by a squib, and, al<lb break="no"/>though immediately taken to the Infirmary, was so <lb/>severely burnt, that she died before morning.</p>
                <p>A very melancholy accident happened at a place <lb/>called the Pease, Berwickshire. As one of the bag<lb break="no"/>gage carts of the Forfarshire militia was stopping <lb/>there, a fine boy about eight years of age, belonging <lb/>to Serjeant-Major Nicol, got out of the cart, and <lb/>was climbing on the wheel, when the horses sudden<lb break="no"/>going off, threw him on the ground, and the <lb/>wheel passing over his body, crushed him to death. <lb/>The unfortunate mother was upon the cart when this <lb/>unhappy accident happened.</p>
                <p>On Thursday night, a spirit shop in Gibson-street, <lb/>Glasgow, was broken into and about five pounds <lb/>in silver, a seven shilling piece, about eight shillings <lb/>of copper, a counterfeit half-guinea, and a poc<lb break="no"/>ket-book containing some bills and papers carried ; <lb/>some partial payments are marked on the bills. The <lb/>villains appear to have entered the shop by forcing <lb/>up the window shutter with an iron bar, and then <lb/>breaking a pane of glass, by which they got the iron <lb/>bolts and the window opened.</p>
                <p>On Saturday last, a porter was killed in the hold <lb/>of a vessel in Dundee harbour. He was engaged <lb/>unloading coals ; and the rope by which the iron pul<lb break="no"/>ly was supported, giving way, the measure fell down <lb/>upon him, and killed him instantly.</p>
                <p>A few days ago, a mason, of the name of Steven<lb break="no"/>son, was killed by the blowing up of some stones, at <lb/>Templeton, in the parish of Auchterhouse. The <lb/>match unfortunately communicated too early to the <lb/>powder, and the explosion took place before he <lb/>could get out of the way. He has left a wife and <lb/>two children to lament his loss.</p>
