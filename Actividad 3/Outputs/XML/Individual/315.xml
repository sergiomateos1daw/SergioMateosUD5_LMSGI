                <p><pb n="5"/> Yesterday forenoon arrived at Spithead, the <lb/>Lord Dorcester merchantman, Edward Howe, <lb/>master, bound from Halifax for London.</p>
                <p>In this ship came six Cherokee Chiefs, of the <lb/>first rank, one of them born in England.</p>
                <p>As soon as their arrival was announced in form, <lb/>Sir Andrew Douglas, Commander of the Alcide, <lb/>of 74 guns, sent his barge to bring them ashore <lb/>to Portsmouth; and, upon landing, they went to <lb/>Bradley's, the crown Inn.</p>
                <p>The object of these Chiefs coming to this coun<lb break="no"/>try is, to endeavour to form a connection with the <lb/>English Government, in order to attempt the re<lb break="no"/>duction of Mexico, near which place they have <lb/>20,000 men in arms, and can raise 30,000 more <lb/>in a short time.</p>
                <p>The Cherokees have menaced that country for <lb/>these last three years, and are favoured by great <lb/>number of the inhabitants in the Spanish settle<lb break="no"/>ments; should they, therefore, procure respectable <lb/>assistance from England, the New World will be <lb/>a certain conquest, and open a source of trade and <lb/>wealth to this nation, that will more than com<lb break="no"/>pensate for the loss of America, and the expence <lb/>of attaining that grand object.</p>
                <p>These Indian Chiefs are dressed in the habit of <lb/>their country, with their faces painted in an ex<lb break="no"/>traordinary manner. They waited on Colonel <lb/>Trigge, of the 12th regiment of foot, and some <lb/>other officers of distinction. One of them, who <lb/>was born in England, named Bowles, speaks Eng<lb break="no"/>lish indifferently well, and is extremely communi<lb break="no"/>cative. He went over to America with his pa<lb break="no"/>rents, who were in the army, when a boy, and by <lb/>some means strayed to an Indian camp, where he <lb/>was most hospitably received, and afterwards rais<lb break="no"/> <lb/>ed to the highest honours of their nation.</p>
                <p>The Cherokee Chiefs are expected in town this <lb/>day, to deliver their<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> to Mr. Secretary <lb/>Grenville.</p>
