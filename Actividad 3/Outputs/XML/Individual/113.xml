                <p>[Extracts of Letters from Quebec and Montreal.]</p>
                <p>Quebec, July 15. <lb/>The commercial world is flourishing here, but in <lb/>political matters, I am sorry to say, we are sadly in <lb/>the back ground. The old defensive system is still <lb/>adhered to, and, I fear much, with all our reinforce<lb break="no"/>ments, we shall do little good till we have another <lb/>commander in chief. There is now a great body of <lb/>regular troops in this country, and a handful of brave <lb/>fellows have recently been almost sacrificed <hi rend="italic">par la </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">petite guerre</hi>  at Chippawa, whilst, in the lower pro<lb break="no"/>vince, there are at least 10,000 regulars doing no<lb break="no"/>thing.</p>
                <p>Some of the officers of the regiments lately arriv<lb break="no"/>ed from France do not conceal their sentiments– <lb/>On inspecting one of the regiments the other day, <lb/>our chief took occasion, as usual, to make some re<lb break="no"/>marks on the cut of the men's clothes, when the Co<lb break="no"/>lonel commanding stepped forward and told him <lb/>plainly, that such systems were now completely ex<lb break="no"/>ploded–that he had had the honour of ser<lb break="no"/>ving very lately under a much more celebrated</p>
                <p><pb/>General that it was probable he would ever serve <lb/>under again–that his men had been accustomed to <lb/>fight, not to dance ; and if such was the plan he was <lb/>called on to follow, he should certainly retire from <lb/>the service. Such language you may suppose was <lb/>not very pleasing to our Governor ; but I am happy <lb/>to find that we now have military men amongst us, <lb/>who are not afraid to speak out ; as it appears the <lb/>numberless representations of civilians are not much <lb/>attended to.</p>
                <p>Montreal, July 14. <lb/>I consider this country now as perfectly secure <lb/>against any attempts that the Americans may make, <lb/>not withstanding the system of our chief does not <lb/>seem to be changed. He has received a great many <lb/>more troops this year than he had any idea of, and <lb/>does not seem pleased at having so large a force un<lb break="no"/>his command, as the country will now look to <lb/>him for some offensive operation against the enemy. <lb/>He has done nothing the whole summer but pa<lb break="no"/>rade about 6000 men at Chambly, where he makes <lb/>them march past him twice a-week, bowing and <lb/>scraping, instead of employing them where they <lb/>ought to be.</p>
                <p>You will have heard of an American army of <lb/>about 6000, under General Jacob Brown, having <lb/>crossed the river at Fort Erie, when General Rial, <lb/>with a force of 1500 only, gallantly assailed them <lb/>but was overpowered by numbers, and sustained con<lb break="no"/>siderable loss. I inclose a general order published <lb/>yesterday about this unfortunate business, whereby <lb/>you will find that our loss has been great.</p>
                <p>Upon this frontier the Americans have hardly <lb/>any force, and it appears very singular indeed, that <lb/>so great a body of men, as are now on the other side <lb/>of the river, from Sorel to Isle Aux Noix, at <lb/>least 10,000 men, should be left for the purpose of <lb/>parade, when they are so much wanted in the upper <lb/>province.</p>
                <p>I sincerely hope that some investigation will take <lb/>place into this business, as it is really disgraceful to <lb/>think that such an enemy should be able to make an <lb/>attack upon us with impunity.</p>
