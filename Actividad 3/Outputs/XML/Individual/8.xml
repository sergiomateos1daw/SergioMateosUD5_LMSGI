                <p><pb/>THE following extract from a late publica<lb break="no"/>tion, entitled, " A State of the present <lb/>Government of the Province of Quebec," will <lb/>give the public some idea of the Canada Bill, <lb/>which has been so much talked of an procrasti<lb break="no"/>nated so long, and at present pending in Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. The work we understand to be the pro<lb break="no"/>duction of Adam Lymburner, Esq; set over by <lb/>the province to negotiate this afair. It is re<lb break="no"/>markable,withhis former publication, for its strong <lb/>nervous elocution and perspicuity of reasoning.</p>
                <p>"Liberty is congenial to the feelings of all <lb/>mankind. The security which flows from a free <lb/>constitution, to both political and civil liberty, <lb/>contributes greatly towards bringing forth the <lb/>powers of the human mind, and the encourage<lb break="no"/>ment of the industry of people ; but no con<lb break="no"/>stitution can be called free where the people are <lb/>not allowed to participate of the legislative au<lb break="no"/>thority by their representatives : This is the great <lb/>criterion of freedom; and it is extremely natural <lb/>for all British subjects, as they know the value of <lb/>it, to struggle for such a valuable right. Great <lb/>Britain has constantly acknoledged this prin<lb break="no"/> <cb/>ciple in the constitution she has granted to all her <lb/>Colonies; and by that means has rendered them <lb/>more flourishing and prosperous than those of o<lb break="no"/> <lb/>ther nations. Although the inhabitants of the <lb/>province of Quebec have, from the general ten<lb break="no"/>dency of the British government to a mild admi<lb break="no"/>nistration, enjoyed a certain degree of civil liber<lb break="no"/>ty; yet they have been, from the peculiar nature <lb/>of the system of their government, entirely de<lb break="no"/>prived of all political liberty. A more full enjoy<lb break="no"/>ment of these essential privileges has been the <lb/>prayer of their petitions, and of those now be<lb break="no"/> <lb/>fore the House of commons. The objects prayed <lb/>for may be reduced to the following heads:â€“</p>
                <p>"1. An elective house of assembly or repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the people. 2. That the members <lb/>of the legislative council receive no salaries as <lb/>counsellors. 3. That the <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> act, and <lb/>the other laws of England relating to personal <lb/>liberty,be made a part of the constitution. 4. That <lb/>trial by jury in civil causes be likewise made part <lb/>of the constitution, and that nine out of twelve <lb/>may return a verdict. 5. That the ancient laws <lb/>and customs of Canada, relative to landed pro<lb break="no"/>perty, marriage settlements, inheritance, and <lb/>dowers, be continued in force in the districts or</p>
