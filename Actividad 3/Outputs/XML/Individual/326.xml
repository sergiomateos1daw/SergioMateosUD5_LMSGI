                <p>On Monday the 12th ult. there was a violent <lb/>tempest at Leominster, Massachusetts, attended <lb/>with hail which was of such a size, and fell with <lb/>such velocity, that the stoutest Indian corn was <lb/>beaten into shreds–vast quantities of apples were <lb/>beaten from the trees–not only the fruit but the <lb/>trees received great injury, the bark being brok<lb break="no"/>en from their limbs; the windows broken in the <lb/>house, and the fences renewed such impressions, <lb/>as to be discovered at 90 yards distance. Many <lb/>of the hailstones were as large as hens eggs–the <lb/>common size was a little more than an inch in di<lb break="no"/>ameter. Twenty-give hours after it fell, banks <lb/>of it were measured at the foot of a hill, and <lb/>found to be 20 inches deep.</p>
                <p>The Saturday following great damage was <lb/><supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> by hail at Shrewsbury, country of Worces<lb break="no"/>ster.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">August</hi>  15. </hi><lb/>On Sunday the 25th July, a violent hail storm <lb/>commenced a few miles to the westward of Wil<lb break="no"/>mington, Delaware, which did great damage to <lb/>many fields of grain, and blew down, in many <lb/>places, an immense quantity of timber. The <lb/>hail in this storm was of an extraordinary appear<lb break="no"/>ance; part of it being about two inches long, <lb/>and of a very considerable circumference.</p>
                <p>On Saturday, the 1st inst. arrived at Wilming<lb break="no"/>ton, Delaware, the brig Maria, Capt. fort, from <lb/>Londonderry, with 200 passengers.</p>
                <p>On the 4th inst. arrived at Philadelphia, the <lb/>Happy Return, Capt. Ewing, in 8 weeks <lb/>from Londonderry, brought 340 passengers in <lb/>good health: Capt. Ewing parted, near the <lb/>Capes of Delaware, with the ship Sally, Capt. <lb/>Miller, with passengers from Londonderry for <lb/>that port also.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Pennsylvania, July</hi>  21. </hi><lb/>Last Sunday evening Mr. John Garrison, son <lb/>of William Garrison, of Newbury township, in <lb/>this county, was killed by lightning in his own <lb/>house. The lightning struck in at the gable and <lb/>just at the instant that Mr. Garrison was in the <lb/>centre of the floor, walking towards the window; <lb/>his brother was standing within two yards of him <lb/>when he fell, but providentially received not the <lb/>smallest hurt.</p>
                <p>We also learn, that Patrick M'Sherry, of Lit<lb break="no"/>tle's-town, in this county, had two cows killed <lb/>by lightning, the same evening.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">New London, July</hi>  30. </hi><lb/>A slight shock of an earthquake was fel tin this <lb/>and the neighhbouring towns, on Sunday morning <lb/>last, about thirty minutes past five o'clock.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Middletown, July</hi>  25. </hi><lb/>About five o'clock this morning, a noise was <lb/>heard that seemed to pass over this city, which is <lb/>thought to have come from a north-westerly direc<lb break="no"/>tion and proceeded to a south-easterly one. The <lb/>noise was equal to loud heavy thunder, and the <lb/>commotion occasioned by it very sensible in the <lb/>shaking of houses, but no damage was done.– <lb/>The Tuesday preceding, about six or seven miles <lb/>to the southward of this place, a similar but hea<lb break="no"/>vier noise was heard, attended with the like com<lb break="no"/>motion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Extract of a letter from Dartmouth, (Connecticut)</hi></hi> <lb/><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">July</hi>  26.</hi></p>
                <p>"Some days ago a house near the college, <lb/>was struck by lightning, and a child therein kill<lb break="no"/>ed. Since that a woman was killed by the same <lb/>means in Cornish, a town adjoining Dartmouth, <lb/>as she sat in her house at work. Later still at <lb/>Hampton, in New York state, a yoke of oxen <lb/>were killed, both by one flash of lightning.–From <lb/>what reason we cannot tell, but the lightning has <lb/>been peculiarly destructive in many of our settle<lb break="no"/><pb n="4"/> <lb/>ments during the present summer. It would ap<lb break="no"/>however, that nature is willing to repair <lb/>those losses; accounts having just come to hand, <lb/>that on last Monday morning a woman in FPlain<lb break="no"/>field was safely delivered of four girls at a<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>; <lb/>one of whom died the night following, the rest <lb/>likely to do well."</p>
                <p>Saturday, at a tavern near the market, the <lb/>following specimen of gormandising was<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> <lb/>ed :–A person, not for any bet, or without <lb/>any other inducement, than the craving of the <lb/>stomach,eat, at one meal, a shoulder of roast lamb, <lb/>3 slices of bacon, three quarters of a pound of <lb/>cheese, 15 large cucumbers, one half of an 8d <lb/>wheat loaf, a plate of cold potatoes, and drank <lb/>a quarter of cider.</p>
