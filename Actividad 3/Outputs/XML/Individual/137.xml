                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">New colony in Lower Canada</hi></p>
                <p>The following curious notice is extracted from a Que<lb break="no"/>bec paper:–</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Interesting to thousands! – Colony of Brotherly  <lb/>Union.</hi></p>
                <p>"It is in agitation to found a colony upon the ancient <lb/>Spartan plan, sanctioned by apostolical usage, of living <lb/>a common, and enjoying a community of goods. In this <lb/>establishment, as each will labour for all, and all for each, <lb/>personal property will be unknown – and all Just of pri<lb break="no"/>ate gain, engendered by an imperfect organization of <lb/>society, will be sacrificed at the shrine of public felicity</p>
                <p>"To carry this project into execution, a fertile tract <lb/>of land, consisting of some thousands of acres, is on the <lb/>point of being purchased and surveyed</p>
                <p>"Husbandmen and artisans of every sort are invited <lb/>to this colonization. We tender the right hand of fel<lb break="no"/>lowship to the honest and industrious of every descrip<lb break="no"/>tion of people, whatever be their religious of political <lb/>faith.</p>
                <p>"Want of funds will not furnish a reason for exclud<lb break="no"/>ing any colonist ; and, on the other hand, it will be a <lb/>fundamental law of this establishment, that whatever <lb/>property may be, by adventurers, put into the common <lb/>stock, will be considered as a loan, and refunded to them <lb/>r their assignees on demand.</p>
                <p>"The colony will be situated within the bounds of <lb/>Lower Canada, and under the protection and control of <lb/>his Majesty's Government.</p>
                <p>"All persons who are willing to embark in this enter<lb break="no"/>prise are requested to address themselves to the sub<lb break="no"/>scribers, personally or by letter. They will specify their <lb/>country, age, profession, number of children (if married) , <lb/>propery, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>"No letter will be received by from principals, nor <lb/>unless <hi rend="italic">post paid</hi>  – Every letter to bear on its superscrip<lb break="no"/>tion the words, ' Colony of Brotherly Union.'</p>
                <p>"s soon as a sufficient number of applicants shall <lb/>have inrolled their names, notice will given by public <lb/>advertisement to convene and digest a code of laws and <lb/>regulations for the establishment.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="smallcaps">S. Cleveland Blyth</hi></p>
                <p>St Contant, Lower Canada, Dec. 3. 1818</p>
                <p>"The several gentlemen who conduct the public pa<lb break="no"/>ers printed in these provinces and the neighbouring states <lb/>of America are respectfully requested to give the above <lb/>one insertion <hi rend="italic">pro bono publico</hi>."</p>
