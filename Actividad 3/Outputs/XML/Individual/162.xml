                <p>Extract from " A Visit to the Province of Upper Canada, <lb/>in 1819," By <hi rend="smallcaps">James Strachan.</hi></p>
                <p>[?] the Stream of Emigration now chiefly to the <lb/>United States, and not to Canada.</p>
                <p>The greater number are decieved; they know no<lb break="no"/>[?] of this country. Many leave Great Britain from <lb/>[?] discontents; and such the province is better. <lb/>[?]. Lately the notes of Mr. Birkbeck have ex<lb break="no"/>[?] much consideration; and all his assertions have <lb/>[?] believed, without investigation. Though I <lb/>[?] [?] a bad man (I know him only from his <lb/>[?] yet he is much to be pitied, for his choice is <lb/>[?]; and by this time he begins to feel it. <lb/>[?] Birkbeck, accustomed to all the comforts, and, <lb/>[?], much of the elegance of life, plunges, <lb/>[?[ family, into a forest, where they have fre<lb break="no"/>[?] to sleep under the canopy of heaven with a <lb/>[?]. He is forced to take the axe in his hand, <lb/>[?] in felling the pines of which he is to make <lb/>[?], which he builds at a great distance <lb/>[?] neighbour–opening to a wet plain, in <lb/>[?] and an impenetrable forest in the rear. This <lb/>[?] covered with bark–it has no floor but <lb/>[?] as the surrounding country is flat, there <lb/>[?], and no boards to be had. Mr Birk<lb break="no"/>[?] date not leave home, for any distance, with<lb break="no"/>[?] guide; and his children cannot go twenty <lb/>[?] from the house, without being lost. He gets <lb/>[?] pressing of his wants supplied at an enor<lb break="no"/>mous[?] expense. And now, that he is on his land. <lb/>[?] shall he do; it is covered with trees, or it is <lb/>[?] unhealthy; and if he hire people to work, <lb/>[?] of the farm will never pay them: but <lb/>[?] bae servants, and he is obliged to sit down <lb/>[?] them, and to become their companion. Mr. <lb/>Birkbeck[?], who was accustomed to go from one field <lb/>to another, admiring his crops and his cattle, and <lb/>thing to do but to give the servants their orders <lb/>the day, and saw all his works proceeding as ra<lb break="no"/>[?] as he wished, now finds himself an insulated <lb/>[?], surrounded by a few miserable fiels, taken <lb/>[?] the bog, and full of musquetoes; his children <lb/>[?] sick from this unhealthy situation; and, in <lb/>[?] severe disease, beyond the reach of medical <lb/>assistance. It is possible to believe that, under such <lb/>circumstances, he does not regret the country he has <lb/>[?]. And let me not be told that the prospect of <lb/>[?]] his children a rich inheritance will turn the <lb/>[?] into sweet–he is not that sort of man; nor do <lb/>[?] any law of nature which urges a parent to <lb/>[?] his own happiness, in order to confer a doubt<lb break="no"/>[?] upon his children. We allow that, after a <lb/>[?], he will be surrounded with neighbours; <lb/>[?] their society is not very agreeable; it is indeed <lb/>[?], as Mr Birkbeck himself admits. After <lb/>[?] his connexions, his country, all his early <lb/>[?] and pleasing recollections, his ease and <lb/>[?] what does he gain? Some landed property, <lb/>[?] he dies in improving, in an unhealthy situa<lb break="no"/>tion[?]. He may not be able to leave a farm to each of his <lb/>children[?]; but of what use will they be if not culti<lb break="no"/>vated[?]? And he will discover in the bitterness of <lb/>[?], that this legacy is not equal to the placing <lb/>[?] upon a farm, though taken at a rack-rent. <lb/>[?] different the situation of a loyal farer, pos<lb break="no"/>[?] of Mr. Birkbeck's substance, if he should <lb/>[?] this province[?]![?] He need not go ten miles from <lb/>[?] settlement, even if he went at once up<lb break="no"/>[?] lands granted him by the crown. But, if he <lb/>[?] an improved farm, his privations will be <lb/>[?] compared to those which he must suffer in <lb/>[?] to the back settlements of the United States, as <lb/>[?] still more fully appear.</p>
                <p>It should not, however, be forgotten, that, with <lb/>[?] possible advantage of soil, neighbourhood, <lb/>[?] climate, emigration to America, a country so <lb/>[?] from Great Britain, is a matter of deep and <lb/>[?] consideration. The persons emigrating <lb/>[?] civil in their property, break up all commerce, <lb/>[?], and connexions in the country they are leav<lb break="no"/>[?] and if they find their expectations disappoint<lb break="no"/>[?] the country of their choice, they are ashamed, <lb/>perhaps unable, to return. Emigrants often fail, <lb/>[?] they have never examined their subjects pro<lb break="no"/>[?] and find, on trial, that they do not possess <lb/>qualities to insure success.–The habits, <lb/>knowledge, and accomodation of manners, <lb/>[?] this new life requires, are not, perhaps, na<lb break="no"/>[?] to them–they have not the strength, the <lb/>[?] and perseverance, which their new situation <lb/>[?]. The emigrant is not prepared to meet the <lb/>difficulties[?] which the climate, new manner of living, <lb/>[?] or vermin, may bring upon him; and which, <lb/>[?] of all his exertions, may frequently destroy <lb/>[?]. It is, therefore, the greatest cruelty to <lb/>[?] the matter partially; and, while the advantages <lb/>[?] from the old to the new world are drawn <lb/>[?] most fascinating colours, to conceal the priva<lb break="no"/>[?] and sacrifices which must be made, and the <lb/>[?] of failure which may be opposed to <lb/>of success.</p>
                <p>We[?] shall have occasion to prove, by the most un<lb break="no"/>[?] the evidence, that Upper Canada offers to emi<lb break="no"/>[?] advantages, vastly superior to any portion of <lb/>[?] United States; but we would still admonish <lb/>[?] thinking to leave their native country, <lb/>[?] the matter with severe minuteness, not <lb/>[?] away by golden dreams; and to prepare <lb/>[?] should they decide upon going, to meet <lb/>[?] [?] from sickness, from different <lb/>[?], [?] labour, and privations of various <lb/>[?] Yet though no step can be so important as <lb/>[?] leaving one native's country for ever, it is to <lb/>[?] that such a step is taken without due con<lb break="no"/>[?]. The fancy is deluded with goldren dreams; <lb/>farmers[?] in America are owners of the soil on <lb/>[?] they live; they have no rents to pay, no tax<lb break="no"/>[?] their doors; possessing a noble indepen<lb break="no"/>[?] they acknowledge no superiority but genius <lb/>[?]. These are high sounding things, but <lb/>[?] than solid. Before a man allows him<lb break="no"/>[?] deluded by them, he should remember, <lb/>[?] no great hardship to pay rent, if his pro<lb break="no"/>[?] three times the price in England that it <lb/>[?] America; that the difficulty of bringing <lb/>[?] to maret, a tax, not perhaps inferior <lb/>[?] he had paid at home, and attended with <lb/>difficulties[?] which he never experience; that <lb/>[?] of intercourse by good roads and canals, <lb/>[?] time, and the tear and wear of his car<lb break="no"/>[?] amd cattle are worth a very considerable sum; <lb/>in removing from his native country, he is <lb/>[?] the improvements of a thousand years, to en<lb break="no"/>[?] all the rudeness of nature; that he is risking <lb/>[?] happiness, and that of his children, by a <lb/>[?] [?] be retraced, and plunging into <lb/>[?] whose manner and habits are differ<lb break="no"/> <cb/>ent from his own; and that he will have every thing <lb/>to learn in the midst of strangers.</p>
                <p>When a man has, after mature deliberation, de<lb break="no"/>termined to emigrate, which various considerations <lb/>may, in particular cases, render prudent, his next <lb/>question is, Where shall he go–to the United States <lb/>or to Canada? We shall suppose the persons emi<lb break="no"/>grating to be friends to the British constitution; for <lb/>if they are not, there is no question; because level<lb break="no"/>lers and democrats will find themselves in a bad <lb/>situation in coming to Canada, as they will find no <lb/>kindred spirits there. But though we can willing<lb break="no"/>ly spare such as these, to lose good subjects is a <lb/>serious evil to the empire; and to lose them through <lb/>ignorance, and the want of that information which <lb/>it is in our power to give, is a folly, as well as <lb/>all evil.</p>
                <p>I am persuaded, that all emigrants, of the descrip<lb break="no"/>tion we mention, would rather prefer to remain un<lb break="no"/>due their own government, than to live under and <lb/>swear allegiances to another, provided no greater <lb/>sacrifices were required in going to the one than to <lb/>the other. I am indeed quite certain, that many <lb/>would consent willing to a considerable sacrifice <lb/>for this advantage, so agreeable to their feelings and <lb/>habits; but we shall shew that no such sacrifice is <lb/>required, and that their interest, as well as inclina<lb break="no"/>tion, when duly considerd, will lead them to Upper <lb/>Canada.</p>
                <p>In going to the United States, we have Mr. Birk<lb break="no"/>beck's authority, that 'no good settlement can be <lb/>made cast of the Alleghany mountains, or in the <lb/>Atlantic States.' The lands are now so dear, as to <lb/>be in general, far beyond the reach of common <lb/>emigrants, who have seldom much left after landing <lb/>in America.</p>
                <p>Suppose two families to land in America–one at <lb/>New York, or Philadelphia, on the way to Mr Birk<lb break="no"/>beck's settlement; and one at Quebec, on the way to <lb/>Upper Canada.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Miles </hi><lb/>From Philadelphia to Pittsburgh 320 <lb/>From Pittsburgh down the Ohio, to Shawanoe <lb/>Town, 1200 <lb/>From Shawanoe Town to Mr Birkbeck's settle<lb break="no"/>ment, 50 <lb/>1570</p>
                <p>Expense of a family travelling this route, suppos<lb break="no"/>ing the family to consist of ten persons, and to carry <lb/>with them two tons of goods:</p>

An ark, or large scow, <lb/>must be purchased, hands hired to go down, <lb/>and they must be paid to return, as much from <lb/>Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, 420 <lb/>From Shawanoe Town to Mr Birkbeck, for bag<lb break="no"/>gage and person, 100 <lb/>940 <lb/>To purchase two hundred acres of land, at two <lb/>dollars per acre 400 <lb/>Total expenses 1310</p>
                <p>The same family, landed at Quebec, <lb/>Pays, to Montreal, 200 miles, two dollars each, 20 <lb/>For the good[?] 12 <lb/>From Montreal to Kingston, 220 miles, up the <lb/>river St. Lawrence, goods and persons, for the <lb/>batteau can take all, 100 <lb/>If the family proceed to York, which is seldom <lb/>necessary as Kingston 150 miles within the <lb/>province, and lands in its neighbourhoods to be <lb/>sold or granted, there will be an additiona ex<lb break="no"/>pense of 80 <lb/>To such a family, possessed of property, govern<lb break="no"/>ment might grant 200 acres, on paying fees, <lb/>about 70 <lb/>Or it may be purchased at two dollars per acres, 130 <lb/>Total expenses, 412</p>
                <p>From this calculation it is seen, that the settler, <lb/>with his large family, by coming to Upper Canada, <lb/>instead of joining Mr. Birkbeck, even if he purchases <lb/>his lands at the same price, saves 928 dollars, which <lb/>will enable him to clear a large portion of his farm, <lb/>stock it, and build a comfortable house; and if he <lb/>be granted the land, instead of purchasing it, there <lb/>is a further saving of 130 dollars.</p>
                <p>Let us now see what the product at Mr. Birkbeck's <lb/>settlement in the Illinois, and in Upper Canada, will <lb/>command in the market; for, notwithstanding the <lb/>greatness of the first saving in coming to Upper <lb/>Canada, if the markets be inferior it might soon be <lb/>balanced.</p>
                <p>Illinois Upper Canada <lb/>Wheat, per bushel t0 3 9 Wheat, per bushel t0 5 0 <lb/>India corn, 0 1 1 India corn, 0 4 0 <lb/>Oats, 0 1 6 Oats, 0 2 6 <lb/>Hay, per ton 1 19 0 Hay, per ton 2 10 0 <lb/>Butter, per lb. 0 0 7 Butter, per lb. 0 1 3 <lb/>Cheese 0 1 3 Cheese 0 0 10 <lb/>Fowls, per couple, 0 1 7 Fowls, per couple, 0 1 6 <lb/>t2 8 9 t3 5 1 <lb/>N.B. These prices, taken from Mr. Birkbeck's book, are <lb/>t50 per cent, above the truth.</p>
                <p>From this table it is manifest, that the produce <lb/>raised in Upper Canada sells at an advance of up<lb break="no"/>wards of 30 per cent on what the same can be sold <lb/>in the Illinois territory, supposing Mr. Birkbeck's <lb/>prices correct, which they are not, being much too <lb/>high. The vast advantage, therefore, in coming to <lb/>Upper Canada, must appear manifest.</p>
                <p>It may by some be said, that the families are too <lb/>numerous, as there are few that consist of ten per<lb break="no"/>sons; but the results will be proportionally the same, <lb/>whatever the number be; and if we suppose them <lb/>to consist of persons in comfortable circumstances in <lb/>their own country, they will commonly bring ser<lb break="no"/>vants with them, by which the average will be still <lb/>greater. But this is of no moment; the difference <lb/>of expense in travelling 500 miles, or 1570, is suf<lb break="no"/> <lb/>ficiently clear.</p>
                <p>We must add, to the disadvantage of Mr. Birk<lb break="no"/>beck's farmer, the dearness of all those articles which <lb/>he has to purchase; for his distance from the sea<lb break="no"/>coast and market operates in two ways to his disad<lb break="no"/>vantage. 'His produce is low, and the goods from <lb/>are dear: the shopkeeper, who is at a great <lb/>distance from the place where the articles he deals <lb/>in are procured, will add to the price, when he dis<lb break="no"/>poses of the, the additional expense of bringing, <lb/>and the time lost in procuring them. To him who <lb/>is obliged to take a journey of 1600 miles to procure <lb/>his articles of merchandize, the cost and trouble must <lb/>be very great; and all this he makes the consumer <lb/>pay. The journey which Mr. Birkbeck's merchant <lb/>is obliged to take is a very serious one, compared to <lb/>that of the merchant of York or Niagara. The lat<lb break="no"/>ter, in consequence of this situation, can trade with <lb/>a smaller capital than the former; because he can <lb/>at any time procure a fresh supply in a few days, <lb/>while the former can lay in a stock of goods only <lb/>once a-year. Now, all these difficulties are to be <lb/>paid for by the farmers and mechanics, who con<lb break="no"/>sume the articles imported; the difference to them, <lb/>in the course of a twelvemonth, by receiving less for <cb/>the articles they sell, and paying more for those they <lb/>purchase will be found to be very great.</p>
                <p>'It is not merely the quantum he shall raise, but <lb/>the sun he shall get for it, which constitutes the <lb/>farmer's advantage. It is not simply to get enough <lb/>to eat and drink that is to bound the desires of the <lb/>farmer; it is to procure the means of converting his <lb/>log-cabin into a handsome and convenient house– <lb/>to erect a large barn for his grain, and suitable build<lb break="no"/>ings for his cattle–to educate his children–and, <lb/>as he grows old, to enjoy the satisfaction of finding <lb/>that his industry has supplied the comforts of life, <lb/>and enabled him to satisfy the wants of society– <lb/>wants to which we are indebted for amelioration <lb/>of mankind.'</p>
                <p>In the selection of a place to residence in a new <lb/>country, it is very important to take into view the <lb/>ultimate market for the farmer's produce. While <lb/>the country is settling, there will be no difficulty; <lb/>for the increasing population will demand all the <lb/>supplies that can be raised. But the prudent set<lb break="no"/>tler will look beyond that period, and consider what <lb/>he shall do when every one raises more grain than <lb/>he will be able to consume. In that case, vicinity <lb/>to market, and facility of transportation, are all im<lb break="no"/>portant. Now, the produce of Upper Canada can <lb/>be sent to Montreal, one of the best markets in A<lb break="no"/>merica in five or six days, at a trifling expense, <lb/>which is yearly diminishing as the waters are im<lb break="no"/>proved. Very different is the case with the farmer <lb/>in the western division of the United States: the im<lb break="no"/>mense distance which grain has to be sent, occasions <lb/>the expense to be so great, as frequently to equal, and <lb/>sometimes exceed, the price offered when it reaches <lb/>the market. The more that this statement is exa<lb break="no"/>mined, the more correct it will be found, and the <lb/>superior advantages of Canada will appear in a strong<lb break="no"/>er light; but, having been a landholder, it is time <lb/>to instruct the emigrant how he is to make his living <lb/>out of it.</p>
