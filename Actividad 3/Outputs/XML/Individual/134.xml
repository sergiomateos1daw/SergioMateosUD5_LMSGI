                <pb/><head><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to America</hi>.</head>
                <p>In answer to the remarks which appeared in <lb/>our paper on Monday last, respecting emigration <lb/>to America, and to the statements there given <lb/>of the disadvantages which emigrants from <lb/>this country might expect to meet with, we have <lb/>received a very abusive letter from an anony<lb break="no"/>mous correspondent, who appears very angry, <lb/>and, like most other angry men, seems more <lb/>anxious to give full vent to his wrath than to as<lb break="no"/>sign any good reason for it. His first cause of <lb/>quarrel is, that we have stated the general want <lb/>of cleanliness to be a prevailing defect in the <lb/>back parts of the United States. For this we <lb/>have the authority of almost every traveller who <lb/>has visited those parts. The remarks of Birkbeck <lb/>on this point are conclu-sive and striking: –</p>
                <p>' In viewing the Americans (he observes) and <lb/>' sketching, in a rude manner, as I pass along, <lb/>' their striking characteristics, I have seen a de<lb break="no"/>' formity so general, that I cannot help esteem<lb break="no"/>' ing it national, though I know it admits of ve<lb break="no"/>' ry many individual exceptions. I have written <lb/>' it, and then erased it, wishing to pass it by, <lb/>' but it wont do – it is the truth, and to the truth <lb/>' I must adhere. Cleanliness in houses, and too <lb/>' often in person, is neglected to a degree which <lb/>' is very revolting to an Englishman.</p>
                <p>' America was bred in a cabin ; this is not a <lb/>' reproach – for the origin is most honourable ; <lb/>' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn <lb/>' logs for a framed building, and that again for <lb/>' a mansion of brick, some of her cabin habits <lb/>' have been unconsciously retained. Many have <lb/>' already been quitted, and one by one they will <lb/>' all be cleared away, as I am told they are now <lb/>' in the cities of the eastern states.</p>
                <p>' There are, I believe, court-houses, which <lb/>' are also made us of as places of worship, in <lb/>' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating <lb/>' ever since they were built. What reverence <lb/>' can be felt for the majesty of religion, or of <lb/>' the laws, in such styles of abomination ? The <lb/>' people who are content to assemble in them <lb/>' can scarcely respect each other. Here is a bad <lb/>' public example. It is said that to clean those <lb/>' places is the office of no one. But why is no <lb/>' person appointed ? Might it not be inferred <lb/>' that a disregard to the decencies of life prevails <lb/>' through such a community?'</p>
                <p>To the same purpose Cobbett complains of the <lb/>' general (for there are many exceptions) sloven<lb break="no"/>' liness about the homsteads, and particularly <lb/>' about the dwellings of labourers. Mr Birkbeck <lb/>' complains of this, and indeed what a contrast <lb/>' with the homesteads and cottages which he left <lb/>' behind him, near the exemplary spot, Guild<lb break="no"/>' ford, in Surrey.' He then proceeds to give the <lb/>reasons for this. When the first settlers took <lb/>possession of the country, the ' example of neat<lb break="no"/>' ness (he observes) was wanting. There were <lb/>' no gentlemn's gardens, kept as clean as <lb/>' drawing-rooms, with grass as even as a car<lb break="no"/>' pet. From endeavouring to imitate perfec<lb break="no"/>' tion men arrive at mediocrity ; and those who <lb/>' never have seen or heard of perfection in these <lb/>' matters, will naturally be slovens.'</p>
                <p>He afterwards remarks –</p>
                <p>' The market day at Guildford is a perfect <lb/>' show of cleanliness. Not even a carter without <lb/>' even a clean smock-frock, and closely shaven <lb/>' and clean washed face. Well may Mr Birkbeck, <lb/>' who came from this very spot, think the people <lb/>' <hi rend="italic">dirty</hi>  in the western country. I'll engage he <lb/>' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one <lb/>' family of his present neighbours, than he left <lb/>' behind upon the skins of all the people in <lb/>' the three parishes of Guildford. However, he <lb/>' would not have found this to be the case in <lb/>' Pennsylvania, and especially in those parts where <lb/>' the Quakers abound ; and, I am told, that in <lb/>' the New England States, the people are as <lb/>' cleanly and as neat as they are in England. <lb/>' The sweetest flowers, when they become pu<lb break="no"/>' trid, stink the most, and a nasty woman is the <lb/>' nastiest thing in nature.'</p>
                <p>In answer to all this, our correspondent tells <lb/>us, that the Scotch are very dirty. This, we <lb/>admit, was formerly, and may still continue in <lb/>some degree to be, the reproach of the Scotch. <lb/>But does this reasonable person mean to argue <lb/>from this, that dirty habits are amiable, and <lb/>ought not to be corrected.</p>
                <p>With regard to the difficulties of effecting a <lb/>settlement, we are borne out in our remarks on <lb/>this subject by the authority of various writers, <lb/>and principally by the autheor of the Emigrant's <lb/>Guide, a work of great merit, which combines <lb/>an extent and precision of statistical informa<lb break="no"/>tion altogether unequally, with the most enlar<lb break="no"/>ged general views of the state of the country, <lb/>both physical and moral. ' Most men (observes <lb/>' this judicious writer) on arriving in the United <lb/>' States, expects too much. Perhaps the only <lb/>' essential advantages offered are the security of <lb/>' person and property, and the cheapness of land. <lb/>' It demands excessive labour, severe economy, <lb/>' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident, to <lb/>' succeed in a newly settled country ; and it de<lb break="no"/>' mands the permanency of this continued la<lb break="no"/>' bour, prudence, and favourable circumstances.'</p>
                <p>Our anonymous correspondent is also ex<lb break="no"/>tremely displeased that we have stated so strong<lb break="no"/>ly the perincious effects produced on the gene<lb break="no"/>ral manners of the Americans by the existence <lb/>of slavery ; and he mentions that many a labour<lb break="no"/>er in this country might envy the condition of an <lb/>American slave. What are those privileges for <lb/>which a free man should envy a slave he does <lb/>not think proper to state. To show, however, <lb/>that we have not exaggerated the degradation <lb/>and oppression of the coloured class in the Unit<lb break="no"/>ed States, we shall again adduce the authority of <lb/>the Emigrant's Guide. The author is contradict<lb break="no"/>ing the notion that the labourer in the slave <lb/>States is confounded with the negroe ; and he <lb/>expresses himself in the following terms: –</p>
                <p>' A residence of 16 years in places where sla<lb break="no"/>' very is prevalent, enables us to contradict a <lb/>' general expression, that, in such places, whites, <lb/>' performing manual labour, are confounded in <lb/>' the moral estimates of the people with slaves. <lb/>' Though less respect is certainly paid to useful <lb/>' labour in the slave states than where all the <lb/>' duties are performed by whites, yet <lb/>' the distance between the two races of men are <lb/>' in all cases immense. So deep, profound, and <lb/>' inveterate is the feeling on that subject, that <lb/>' not any where in the United States can pro<lb break="no"/>' perty, sobriety, intelligence, and every other <lb/>' advantage, expect colour, raise in public opi<lb break="no"/>' nion a man the most remotely allied to the <lb/>' African, to a rank equal to the meanest white. <lb/>' Any person who resides a few years in Louisi<lb break="no"/>' ana will be witness to some very remarkable <lb/>' exemplifications of this innate contempt for all <lb/>' those who affinity involve them in the con<lb break="no"/>' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery.'</p>
                <p>What a picture is here conveyed of misery <lb/>and degradation on the one hand, and of tyranny <lb/>on the other. – Here we find it failry confessed <lb/>that no degree of worth, whether moral or intel<lb break="no"/> <cb/>lectual, not even the possession of property, can <lb/>give a man the least degree of consideration in <lb/>the eyes of the privileged class. We cannot <lb/>conceive a community more wretchedly consti<lb break="no"/>tuted. All that is estimable and worthy is here <lb/>utterly contemned, because the individual who <lb/>possesses these qualities happens to have his skin <lb/>of a particular colour, and thus a merely acci<lb break="no"/>dental quality of the corporeal frame entails <lb/>upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy <lb/>and contempt. These distinctions, carried to <lb/>such an excess, seem to us to be founded on the <lb/>extinction of every generous and honourable sen<lb break="no"/>timent, and we cannot help still asserting that <lb/>we had rather live we at present are, than <lb/>in a community where such hateful antipathies <lb/>rule to the exclusion of every just and humane <lb/>feeling.</p>
                <p>With regard to the condition of the negroe <lb/>slaves we shall quote a passage from Brown's <lb/>Western Gazetteer or Emigrant's Directory <lb/>after reading which, we shall leave our anony<lb break="no"/>mous correspondent to say whether he thinks <lb/>the condition of a labourer in this country pre<lb break="no"/>ferable to that of being an African slave. The <lb/>writer, describing the town of Lexington, in <lb/>Kentucky, observes –</p>
                <p>' In this square stands the market-house, <lb/>' which is of brick, and well furnished on Wed<lb break="no"/>' nesdays and Saturdays ; but occasionally the <lb/>' scene of a barbarous practise ; for it is here <lb/>' that incorrigible or delinquent negroes are <lb/>' flogged unmercifully. I saw this punishment <lb/>' inflicted on two of these wretches. Their <lb/>' screams soon collected a numerous crowd ; I <lb/>' could not help saying to myself, " These cries <lb/>' are the knell of Kentucky libery.' "</p>
                <p>Having made this answer to the angry charges <lb/>thus brought against us, we have only to dis<lb break="no"/>claim, in the strongest terms, all hostility or pre<lb break="no"/>judice against the Americans. We have no <lb/>wish either to depreciate their character or in<lb break="no"/>stitutions. They exhibit the interesting spectacle <lb/>of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace <lb/>to wealth and greatness. To revile such a <lb/>people would be the height of human folly, and <lb/>equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to <lb/>take offence because endeavour to make a <lb/>fair estimate of their character, without hiding <lb/>any of its defects.</p>
