                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Provincial Parliament of Lower Canada </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Quebec Legislative Council–March 17.</hi></p>
                <p>This day his Excellency the Governor in Chief made the <lb/>following[?] speech to both Houses:–</p>
                <p>"Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentlemen <lb/>of the House of Assembly,</p>
                <p>"When the Parliament met for the dispatch of public <lb/>business[?], I did entertain a hope that the experience of the <lb/>[?] few years would have led you to a mature and serious <lb/>consideration[?] of the consequences that would inevitably <lb/>follow[?], if the then state of things should not be remedied ; <lb/>I[?] cannot therefore be surprised that I should now ex<lb break="no"/>press[?] not only my disappointment, but great concern that <lb/>[?] same question of constitutional principle should have <lb/>[?]ia disturbed the unanimity of your legislative proceed<lb break="no"/>ings[?].</p>
                <p>"Upon this occasion I think it a duty which I owe to <lb/>[?] and to your country to call upon you to consider, du<lb break="no"/>ring[?] this summer, the result of the discussions of the ses<lb break="no"/>sesion[?] in all its bearings.</p>
                <p>"You will see the administration of the civil govern<lb break="no"/>ment[?] left without any pecuniary means but what I shall <lb/>advance[?] upon my own personal responsibility ; you will <lb/>[?] individuals suffering under severe and unmerited hard<lb break="no"/>ships[?], caused by the wast of that constitutional authority <lb/>that[?] is necessary for the payment of the expences of the <lb/>civil[?] government. You will see the interior improve<lb break="no"/>ments[?] of the country nearly at a stand ; you will see, in <lb/>[?]ort, the executive government in a manner palsied and <lb/>powerless[?].</p>
                <p>"When I shall again summon you to meet here in Par<lb break="no"/>liament[?], you will come to decide the important question, <lb/>whether[?] the Government shall be restored to its constitu<lb break="no"/>tional[?[ energy, or whether you are to deplore the prospect <lb/>[?] lasting misfortune, by a continuance in the present state <lb/>[?] things. Important as that question is, there can be no <lb/>difficulty[?[ in the decision. When the blessingsof the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish[?] constitution were granted to this province, you re<lb break="no"/>[?]ved with it the recorded experience of centuries of <lb/>[?]ctise. There is no question of doubt or of difficulty <lb/>[?]that may not find its precedent in the records of the Im<lb break="no"/>[?]Imperial Parliament ; and I cannot thik that any wiser <lb/>[?]guide need by desired."</p>
                <p>After which, the Honourable Speaker of the Legislative <lb/>[?]council said, that it was the pleasure of his Excellency the <lb/>[?]Governor in Chief that the Provincial Parliament should <lb/>[?] prorogued until Thursday, the 26th of April next.</p>
