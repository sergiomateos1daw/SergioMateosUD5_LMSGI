                <p>Quebec, Sept. 3. <lb/>The army from this province has entered the United States <lb/>by the Champlain frontier. On the 1st inst. the advance was <lb/>at Chazy.</p>
                <p>Quebec, Sept. 8. <lb/>From the north-western frontier of Upper Canada, Messrs <lb/>M'Gillivray and M'Leod, who arrived here on Thursday last, <lb/>have brought dispatches from Lieutenant Colonel M'Donal, <lb/>at Michillimackinac, written since the repulse of the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can forces sent there to recapture it. The following are <lb/>the particulars of that expedition :–</p>
                <p>"On the forenoon of the 5th of August, the Americans <lb/>landed 900 men, or thereabouts, at the back of the island <lb/>(Dowsman's farm). There is a considerable space of ground <lb/>cleared, and a gentle slope, which enabled their vessels, at <lb/>anchor close to the beach, to keep clear, by a constant fire of <lb/>grape, &amp;c. and which by the situation of the ground, passed <lb/>directly over the men's heads, as they formed and advanced <lb/>towards the woods.</p>
                <p>"Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual[?] formed his small garrison <lb/>(150 at most) at the extremity of the woods, and the Indians <lb/>were stationed on each flank, to keep the enemy from out<lb break="no"/>flanking the troops. By a false account of the enemy's inten<lb break="no"/>tion to land on another part of the island, a certain number of <lb/>Indians were sent to watch their motions ; but more Indians <lb/>absenting themselves, exposed one flank of Lieutenant-Colon<lb break="no"/>nel M'Doual's party entirely ; and an apprehension was enter<lb break="no"/>tained that the enemy would outflank and cut off the garrison <lb/>from the forts ; it was therefore deemed expedient to fall back <lb/>between the two forts, and there await the advance of the <lb/>enemy.</p>
                <p>"A party of between 40 and 50 Indians, placed on the left <lb/>flank, and ignorant of the movements in the centre and right <lb/>flank, fired on the Americans, and threw them into confusion, <lb/>which the Indians soon perceived, and encouraging each other <lb/>by whoops and yells, totally broke the little order still observed <lb/>by the enemy, who took instant flight, and were all out of <lb/>reach before Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual was apprised of <lb/>their retreat.</p>
                <p>"Thus was a body of at least from six to nine hundred <lb/>men defeated and put to instant flight by 40 or 50 Indians, <lb/>with a loss of 17 men and a Major (Holmes) killed and found <lb/>on the spot!–The Indians lost but one man."</p>
                <p>Previous to and combined with this, the measures taken by <lb/>the enemy were these:</p>
                <p>"On the [?] of July, a detachment of the expedition sent <lb/>against Michillimackinac by the enemy, proceeded to St Ma<lb break="no"/>ry's, where they met with no resistance, there being neither <lb/>troops nor Indians, and every person occupied about their <lb/>usual concerns ; such as bay making, fishing &amp;c. Major <lb/>Holmes commanded the party, who gave up to indiscriminate <lb/>plunder, and destroyed the whole of the property belonging <lb/>to the North West Company ; burning their houses, stores, <lb/>and vessels, killing their cattle, and taking off their engagees <lb/>prisoners ; tearing down the fences, destroying the gardens, <lb/>fields, &amp;c. Many wanton acts of cruelty might be detailed. <lb/>Let two suffice for the present.</p>
                <p>"Mr Johnstone's property was plundered, even his furni<lb break="no"/>ture ; the very clothing of his wife and children was seized <lb/>upon by these ruthless plunderers, and carried away. Major <lb/>Holmes sent to the south side of the strait for Mr Johnstone's <lb/>son George, and, after threatening and reviling him with the <lb/>most oppobrious language, flourished his sword over his head, <lb/>and said he had a great mind to cut his head off, now he was <lb/>his slave, When they were in the act of burning the houses <lb/>and stores, Mr G. Johnstone was ordered to stand in a cer<lb break="no"/>tain spot, under pain of being shot ; but had he remained, suf<lb break="no"/>foration[?] must have been his fate, being so near the buildings <lb/>in flames : he therefore risked being shot, and came off, and <lb/>thereby effected a timely escape.</p>
                <p>"Another instance of more than savage cruelty was exer<lb break="no"/>cised on a poor horse, which they made us of all day in cart<lb break="no"/>ing their plunder, and in the evening, whilst still tackled to <lb/>the cart, tied him to the end of the dwelling-house then in <lb/>flames, and amused themselves in looking at the poor animal <lb/>making vain efforts to get loose ; but there he was burnt, and <lb/>his bones seen there by the writer of this."</p>
