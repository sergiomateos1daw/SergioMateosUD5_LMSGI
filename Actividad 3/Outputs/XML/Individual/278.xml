It is a native of New <lb/>South Wales, and to be met with in this country in <lb/>very few collections–this being the third plant of the <lb/>kind that has flowered in Great Britain. It is one of <lb/>the four plants which were sent from New Holland to <lb/>the Duchess of Atholl, twelve years ago, and the only <lb/>one that has survived the voyage. The seapus or <lb/>stem is upwards of twelve feet in heigh, from the top <lb/>of which diverge seven stalks, each bearing nine large <lb/>flowers of a deep crimson and pink colour. The for<lb break="no"/>mation of the stalks and outer petals of the flower, re<lb break="no"/>mind one of the Crinum Amabile, but much larger. <lb/>We had no communication as a guide to its culture, <lb/>but kept it at all times, and in all season, associated <lb/>with the most hardy green-houseplants.– <hi rend="italic">Dunkeld </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">Gardens, 24th May.</hi></p>
                <p>By the death of Sir James Montgomery, the office <lb/>of Presenter of Signatures in Scotland has become va<lb break="no"/>cant. We understand that this office is no longer to <lb/>be conducted by deputy.</p>
                <p>On Thursday the 23d ult. the United Associate <lb/>Congregation, Kendal, gave a unanimous call to Mr <lb/>William Ritchie, preacher, to be their pastor.</p>
