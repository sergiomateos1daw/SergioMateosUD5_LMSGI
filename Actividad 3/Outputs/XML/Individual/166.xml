                <p>The following is an extract of a private letter <lb/>dated</p>
                <p>"Halifax, May 22 <lb/>"At two o'clock this day the Earl of Dal<lb break="no"/>housie, Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief <lb/>of British North America, attended by the Ad<lb break="no"/>miral, his Majesty's Council, the staff, naval and <lb/>military officers, and the principal people of the <lb/>place, attended to lay the first stone of a new <lb/>college, to be erected at the north end of the <lb/>grand parade. The whole of the freemasons of <lb/>Halifax went in grand procession. They formed <lb/>in lodges at their hall, and, preceded by a military <lb/>band, and followed by another, they marched to <lb/>the places prepared for them on the building.</p>
                <p>"His Lordship came on the scaffolding at <lb/>two o'clock, the grenadiers of the 62d regiment <lb/>being his guard of honour. Detachments from <lb/>each regiment kept the ground.</p>
                <p>"After a prayer by the Rev. Mr Twining, <lb/>Grand Chaplain, Lord Dalhousie addressed the <lb/>assembly in a speech, of which I have not time <lb/>to give an outline ; but in it his Lordship men<lb break="no"/>tioned, that the building was intendeed as a college <lb/>upon the plan of that of Edinburgh, where all <lb/>students who professed the Christian religion <lb/>were eligible for admittance. Strangers residing <lb/>here for a short time might also enjoy the bene<lb break="no"/>fit of the institution, and gentlemen in the army, <lb/>the navy, and the military establishments. His <lb/>Lordship concluded a most eloquent and ani<lb break="no"/>mated address with his fervent wishes for the <lb/>welfare and prosperity of the undertaking.</p>
                <p>"A bottle with coins, and a tin case with <lb/>parchments, &amp;c. were then severally deposited in <lb/>the recess made for them, and the stone was <lb/>lowered into its place with all the requisite and <lb/>due forms, under a royal salute from fort Char<lb break="no"/>lotte ; after which the Rev. the Grand Chaplain <lb/>closed the proceedings with a prayer, and the <lb/>whole assembled multitude gave nine cheers.– <lb/>The military and masonic processions then re<lb break="no"/>turned in the same order, in which they came.</p>
                <p>The day was beautiful, and a greater as<lb break="no"/>semblage of people was never witnessed in Hali<lb break="no"/>fax.</p>
                <p>"The Countess of Dalhousie and her two sons, <lb/>Mrs Admiral Griffith and the Misses Wilson, and <lb/>most of the fashionable ladies here witnessed the <lb/>ceremony from a convenient scaffolding prepa<lb break="no"/>red for them.</p>
                <p>"Lord Dalhousie purposes to leave Halifax <lb/>for Quebec in his Majesty's ship Newcastle, on <lb/>the 1st of June, without waiting for Sir James <lb/>Kempt."</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Court of Chancery</hi> –June 10.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Will of the Late Duke of Queensberry </hi><lb/>Mr Head stated, that he had to present a petition from <lb/>the annuitants and legates of the late Duke of Queens<lb break="no"/>berry, praying that a fourth more of their claims might be <lb/>paid, there now being sufficient funds in the hands of the <lb/>Accountant-General for that purposes. The Learned Coun<lb break="no"/>sel said, that there was no less a sum than L.1,400,000 <lb/>accumulated and vested in the name of this officer, in <lb/>Bank stock, for the benefit of the claimants, and he un<lb break="no"/>derstood it was not intended to oppose the application, al<lb break="no"/>though the executors did not say they would give their <lb/>consent to it. Some consultation had been had on the <lb/>subject out of doors ; he therefore prayed that the prayer <lb/>of the petition should be granted.</p>
                <p>The Attorney-General said, he had not received any in<lb break="no"/>structions, nor had he been consulted.</p>
                <p>The several King's counsel in Court spoke in behalf of <lb/>their respective clients.</p>
                <p>Mr Wingfield appeared for the Earl of Yarmouth, and <lb/>said his Lordship was anxious that the business should be <lb/>put in a train of settlement.</p>
                <p>The Lord Chancellor said, there was not a man existing <lb/>that had a heart in him but must wish the legacies and <lb/>annuities to be paid ; but, said his Lordship, the Marquis <lb/>of Queensberry has commenced an action for the recovery <lb/>of L.150,000 against the executor, and he certainly had a <lb/>right so to do it ; it was, therefore, proper that the Court <lb/>should see that no harm arose to the executors, before the <lb/>funds were allowed to go out of Court. With respect to <lb/>their not opposing the petition, that was very different to <lb/>consenting to it ; it merely said to the Court, " Mind you <lb/>do right."</p>
                <p>Mr Heald said, if his Lordship thought that one-fourth <lb/>was too much, they would take an eight, or any part his <lb/>Lordship pleased.</p>
                <p>The Lord Chancellor.–I will order it to stand first on <lb/>the paper for Tuesday next, and in the mean time I will <lb/>look over the petition.</p>
