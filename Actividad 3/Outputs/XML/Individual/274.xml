                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Commission of the General Assembly</hi></p>
                <p>On Wednesday, the Commission of Assembly met in <lb/>the Tolbooth Church–Dr Muir, Moderator, in the <lb/>chair.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Presbyterian Church in New South Wales. </hi><lb/>–The Moderator recalled to the notice of the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion, that on a former meeting, they had directed him <lb/>to write to Lord Glenelg, Secretary for the Colonies, <lb/>disavowing connection with Dr Lang in New South <lb/>Wales, and blaming his proceedings in that colony, in <lb/>separating himself from the Presbytery there formed in <lb/>connection with the Church of Scotland. Since that <lb/>time he had had a communication from Lord Glenelg, <lb/>which he was sure would be received by the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion with great satisfaction.</p>
                <p>The communication from Lord Glenelg was then <lb/>read. It consisted of a copy of the despatch transmit<lb break="no"/>ted to the Governor of New South Wales, approving <lb/>of his conduct in withholding the salaries of the Pres<lb break="no"/>byterian laymen who had not submitted themselves to <lb/>the authority of the Presbytery in connection with the <lb/>Church of Scotland, and further directing that Dr <lb/>Lang's salary should be discontinued. His lordship <lb/>explained, that in doing this the Government had no <lb/>wish to constitute themselves judges in any ecclesias<lb break="no"/>tical disputes ; but as the salaries awarded to these <lb/>gentlemen had been given on the faith that they were <lb/>to remain in connection with the Church of Scotland, <lb/>they could not be continued so long as they defied her <lb/>authority.</p>
                <p>On the motion of Mr Dunlop, the Commission una<lb break="no"/>nimously expressed their satisfaction with the prompti<lb break="no"/>tude and decision which the Government had shown <lb/>in the matter ; and directed the Moderator to commu<lb break="no"/>nicate their minute to Lord Glenelg. It was also agreed <lb/>to re-appoint the Committee to watch over the farther <lb/>proceedings, especially as it was understoof that Dr <lb/>Lang was now on his way to this country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Case of Small Isles.</hi> –The Commission, then pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded to take up the case of Small Isles, which, it will <lb/>be recollected, arose out of the Rev. Mr M'Lean hav<lb break="no"/>ing, as was alleged, appeared in the lobby of the As<lb break="no"/>sembly House, while that Court was sitting in May last, <lb/>in a state of intoxication. The case occupied the Court <lb/>a considerable part of the day; and at the evening <lb/>sederunt the following motion, by Dr Gardner, was una<lb break="no"/>nimously agreed to–That the Commission having con<lb break="no"/>sidered the evidence on the record, find, that in as far <lb/>as that evidence is hearsay, it is inadmissable; but find <lb/>it proved that on the afternoon of Friday the 25th of <lb/>May last, Mr M'Lean was seen in a state of intoxication <lb/>in the vestibule of the General Assembly, attempting <lb/>to force his way into it; that it is proved he was on two <lb/>other occasions during the sitting of last Assembly in a <lb/>state of intoxication; and, therefore, they find that he <lb/>ought to be deposed from the office of the holy minis<lb break="no"/>try, and direct the Moderator accordingly to pronounce <lb/>the sentence of deposition, directing the Clerk to trans<lb break="no"/>mit an extract of the sentence to the Presbytery of <lb/>Skye, and them to declare the parish of Small Isles <lb/>vacant.–The Moderator pronounced from the chair <lb/>the sentence os deposition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Case of Lethendy.</hi> –In the course of the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings during the early sederunt of the Commission, the <lb/>Procurator rose and said, he might take the present <lb/>opportunity of stating to the Commission, that within <lb/>the last three or four days a petition and complaint had <lb/>been given in to the Court of Session, and appointed to <lb/>be served, at the instance of Mr Clark, presentee to the <lb/>parish of Lethendy, against the Presbytery of Dunkeld, <lb/>and Mr Kessen, whom that Presbytery had lately in<lb break="no"/>ducted into that charge, in despite of interdicts issued <lb/>by the Court of Session. He mentioned the fact to that <lb/>Commission, presuming that they would authorize him <lb/>to defend the Presbytery, who had acted under autho<lb break="no"/>rity of the Commission itself.</p>
                <p>Mr Buchanan of Glasgow, after some remarks in <lb/>commendation of the firmness of the Presbytery in carry<lb break="no"/>ing through the settlement amidst many difficulties, <lb/>moved that "The Commission sanction the Procu<lb break="no"/>rator's defending the Presbytery in the trying <lb/>circumstances in which they are placed, and resolve <lb/>that they will to the utmost of their power encourage <lb/>and support them under whatsoever difficulties they <lb/>may be subjected by their execution of the sentence <lb/>of the Commission ; and that the thanks of the Com<lb break="no"/>mission be given to the Presbytery for the decision and <lb/>temperate firmness with which they have practically <lb/>maintained the rightful authority and jurisdiction of <lb/>the Church."</p>
                <p>Dr Bryce said, he was quite unprepared for any mo<lb break="no"/>tion on this subject; but with the views which he enter<lb break="no"/>tained in regard to this case, it was impossible he could <lb/>concur in the motion proposed, and he must therefore <lb/>dissent from it.</p>
                <p>Mr James Bridges expressed great indignation against <lb/>Mr Clark for thus bidding defiance to the authority of <lb/>the Church Courts, and he proposed, that for thus <lb/>trampling on the rights and dignity of the Church, Mr <lb/>Clark should be forthwith called before the Commission <lb/>for an exemplary punishment.–Mr Dunlop suggested, <lb/>that although he concurred in feeling with Mr Bridges, <lb/>it would be premature at present to take any steps <lb/>against Mr Clark, inasmuch as there was no official <lb/>communication on the subject from the Presbytery of <lb/>Dunkeld.</p>
                <p>Mr Makgill recommended to Mr Bridges, for this <lb/>reason, not to press his motion, declaring, that as at <lb/>this time 200 years ago eight Bishops had been de<lb break="no"/>posed, he trusted the time was not far distant when Mr <lb/>Clark would receive a similar reward for his misconduct; <lb/>and Mr M. said emphatically, that whatever the Pres<lb break="no"/>bytery of Dunkeld might suffer for upholding the inde<lb break="no"/>pendence of the Church, he, as a member of Commis<lb break="no"/>sion, by whose orders they had acted, would be proud to <lb/>bear his share.</p>
                <p>Mr bridges then intimated, that he would waive <lb/>pressing his motion, and Mr Buchanan's was adopted, <lb/>Dr Bryce and Mr W. Malcolm intimating their dissent, <lb/>on the ground that it was incompetent and inexpedient <lb/>for the Commission to adopt such a resolution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Commemoration of the Second Centenary of the </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Celebrated Assembly at Glasgow.</hi> –In the course <lb/>of the day, the Moderator suggested, that as this was <lb/>the second centenary of the great Assembly at Glas<lb break="no"/>gow, which might be considered as the founder, not <lb/>only of their ecclesiastical but of their civil liverties, <lb/>a meeting should be held, exclusively devoted to prayer <lb/>and thanksgiving to Almighty God for the benefits con<lb break="no"/>ferred on their Zion.</p>
                <p>At seven o'clock accordingly, several of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers, and a considerable number of people assembled, <lb/>when an hour was spent in devotional exercises, which <lb/>were conducted by Drs Muir, Lee, and Dickson, in <lb/>succession.</p>
                <p>The Commission adjourned to the second Tuesday in <lb/>February next.</p>
