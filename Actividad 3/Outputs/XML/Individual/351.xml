                <p><pb n="6"/> By private letters and newspapers lately arrived <lb/>from Philadelphia and New York we have inform<lb break="no"/>mation, that the Indians are carrying on their de<lb break="no"/>predations on the back settlements of the United <lb/>States with great vigour; that an enquiry as to <lb/>the miscarriage of the war had been made by <lb/>Congress, and an army was collected this year; <lb/>that the Americans had some expectations of get<lb break="no"/>ting free of the Indian war by treaties.</p>
                <p>We have advices of Governor Clinton's being <lb/>re-elected Governor of New York state by a ma<lb break="no"/>jority of 180, but the friends of Mr. Tay were <lb/>objecting to the return, as the canvassers had not <lb/>opened the boxes which contained the returns <lb/>from three counties, Otsego, Clinton, and Tioga, <lb/>which if opened they say would have given the <lb/>election to Mr. Tay, the county of Otsego alone <lb/>being 300 majority in favours of Mr. Tay.</p>
                <p>A dreadful storm happened at New York on <lb/>the 1st of July, which continued with so much <lb/>violence, that several vessels were driven from their <lb/>moorings, and a number of boats upset and many <lb/>lives lost.</p>
