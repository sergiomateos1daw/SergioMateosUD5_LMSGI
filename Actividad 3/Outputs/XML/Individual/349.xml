                <p><pb n="3"/><hi rend="italic">Norfolk, April</hi>  11. This day arrived the ship <lb/>Albion, John Simmons, master, in 47 days from <lb/>Rotterdam; on the 8th lying to in a heavy gale <lb/>of wind, the Albion shipped a sea, which carried <lb/>away all her boats and every loose article from <lb/>the deck; there were three men of the watch, <lb/>one of whom is washed overboard and perished– <lb/>his name is John M'Naught, and belonged to <lb/>Greenock.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Extract of a letter from a gentleman at the falls of  <lb/>the Ohio, to his relation in<supplied reason="copy blur">Winchester</supplied>, Virginia.  <lb/>dated April</hi>  13, 1791.</p>
                <p>"I wrote to you from Fort Pitt, which place <lb/>we left the 3d. inst. in company with two other <lb/>boats, and proceeded to Limestone, without <lb/>meeting or apprehending danger–at that place <lb/>we were informed of several disasters which had <lb/>befallen boats going down the river, and one to <lb/>a boat going up to a French station, loaded with <lb/>bacon, butter, &amp;c. The particulars relative to <lb/>the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked <lb/>by about 60 or 70 Indians, and the flankets that <lb/>were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. <lb/>–Immediately after firing, they gave the Indian <lb/>whoop, and rushing on the flankets, scalped them <lb/>every one (about 22)– they then fired at the <lb/>boat, but did no damage, as it required some <lb/>time to make their way into the river. After <lb/>the savages had executed this terrible act of bar<lb break="no"/>barity, they continued on the river watching for <lb/>other boats. In the course of about six days, five <lb/>or six boats happened to come down the river–the <lb/>savages attacked the foremost of them, in which <lb/>were two young ladies, of the name Macdonald, <lb/>a young gentleman, and some others, passengers, <lb/>and took it. Elevated with this easy capture, <lb/>they imagined themselves capable of taking every <lb/>boat they might fall in with–In a little time a <lb/>second boat hove in fight, which they attacked <lb/>with great fury–they were in three canoes, each <lb/>canoe containing about twenty–they moved to<lb break="no"/>wards the boat, as it came down, and commenced <lb/>firing; after discharging their guns, they retreat<lb break="no"/>ed, loading and came on a second time, fired and <lb/>repeated nine different times; as often as they <lb/>come on, there was a brisk firing kept up from <lb/>the boat, which contained nine fighting men;– <lb/>during the conflict two were killed, and five <lb/>wounded; two only remained to protect the boat, <lb/>and prevent the Indians from boarding it, which <lb/>every appearance of their conduct plainly indi<lb break="no"/>cated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves <lb/>in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the <lb/><supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>, they threw billets of wood at them, and <lb/>one of them took up an ax, as a weapon of de<lb break="no"/>fence, should they persist in boarding, which the <lb/>Indians perceiving, and, as is supposed, their <lb/>ammunition being expended, they retreated, <lb/>without accomplishing their object.</p>
                <p>"These inhuman monsters, previous to their <lb/>attacking the last mentioned boat, placed the <lb/>two young ladies in front of their canoes, <lb/>in which situation they were both killed. A few <lb/>days after this transaction, they fired at another <lb/>boat, and killed one young man. In short, every <lb/>boat tat has gone down the river lately, has <lb/>been fired at, except our's. We saw no Indians; <lb/>the places where the above depredation happen<lb break="no"/>ed we passed in the night."</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Boston, May</hi>  4. It is supposed that the adven<lb break="no"/>tures of the town of Boston, lost 25,000 dollars in <lb/>the late lottery; besides 'wear and tear' of con<lb break="no"/>science.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Salem, May</hi>  31. His excellency our worthy <lb/>overnor perceiving, with his usual discernment, <lb/>that Lotteries have a tendency to withdraw the <lb/>people's attention from industry, the only certain <lb/>source of wealth and prosperity; and also that <cb/>they operate as a<supplied reason="copy blur">??? ??? ???, ??? ???</supplied> <lb/>and embarrassed being<supplied reason="copy blur">??? the ??? a<lb break="no"/></supplied> <lb/>venturers; suggests, in<supplied reason="copy blur">??? ???</supplied> the <lb/>Legislature, the propriety of discontinuing this <lb/>mode of raising money.</p>
                <p>The states of Connecticut and New Hampshire <lb/>have passed laws, prohibiting the sale of lottery <lb/>tickets of other states, in their states.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bennington, May</hi>  30. A gentleman from the <lb/>northward informs, that the part at the British <lb/>post lately holden in this state, has recently been <lb/>recalled.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Baltimore, May</hi>  27. Colonel Jacob Webb, and <lb/>Captain Miller, formerly of Stamford, in Con<lb break="no"/>cecticut, Mr. John Carmel, of Philadelphia, mer<lb break="no"/>chant, and several other gentlemen, with a negro <lb/>boy, were drowned, on the 9th of March last, in <lb/>St. Mary's river (Georgia) occasioned by the o<lb break="no"/>versetting of a boat, in a sudden flaw of wind.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Boston, May</hi>  25. On Friday last, the vene<lb break="no"/>rable Mr. John Simonds, of Salem, entered the <lb/><hi rend="italic">one hundredth year of his age</hi>. He is the only <lb/>male person who has arrived at that great age <lb/>from the first settlement of the town by the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish, in 1629, to the present day.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">New York, June</hi>  9.</hi></p>
                <p>General Washington, on his tour to the South<lb break="no"/>ern Sates, landed at Charlestown, South Caro<lb break="no"/>lina, in a barge decorated for the purpose, with <lb/>colours and pendants, and rowed by twelve A<lb break="no"/>merican Captains and a Cockswain, all dressed in <lb/>blue silk jackets, black silk breeches, white stock<lb break="no"/>ings, and blue roses to their shoes. They had like<lb break="no"/>wife hold laced hats; with silk bandeaus, with the <lb/>motto, <hi rend="italic">Long live the President</hi>. An immense <lb/>number of people assembled near the Quay, and <lb/>on board the vessels in the river, which, as well <lb/>as works, saluted him with several discharges of <lb/>artillery. The day was afterwards devoted to <lb/>conviviality–The lodge of St. John addressed <lb/>his Excellency as follows:–</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="italic">Right Worshipful Sir</hi>, <lb/>"We the <hi rend="smallcaps">Master, Officers and Members </hi><lb/>of St. John's Lodge, No. 2 of Newbern, beg <lb/>leave to hail you welcome with <hi rend="smallcaps">three times  <lb/>three</hi> ! We approach you not with the language <lb/>works have proved you to be the true and faith<lb break="no"/>ful <hi rend="italic">Brother</hi>, the skilful and expert <hi rend="italic">Craftsmen</hi>, the <lb/>just and upright <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>.</p>
                <p>But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to <lb/>express with sufficient energy, the cordial warmth <lb/>with which our bosoms glow towards you–We <lb/>therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and <lb/>devoutly pray, that the Providence of the Most <lb/>High, may strengthen, establish and protect you <lb/>in your walk through life–and when you are <lb/>called off from your terrestrial labours, by com<lb break="no"/>mand of our <hi rend="smallcaps">divine grand master</hi>, and your <lb/>operations sealed with the mark of his approba<lb break="no"/>tion, may <hi rend="smallcaps">your soul</hi>  be everlastingly refreshed <lb/>with the streams of living water which flow from <lb/>the right hand of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>. And when the Supreme <lb/>Architect of all world's shall collect his most pre<lb break="no"/>cious jewels, as ornaments of the Celestial Jerusa<lb break="no"/>lem–may you eternally shine among those of the <lb/>brightest lustre."</p>
                <p>To which the President returned the following <lb/>answer:– <lb/>" <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen</hi>, <lb/>"I receive the cordial welcome which you <lb/>are pleased to give me, with sincere gratitude. <lb/>My best ambition having aimed at the unbiassed <lb/>approbation of my fellow citizens, it is peculiarly <lb/>pleasing to find my conduct so affectionately ap<lb break="no"/>proved,, by a fraternity whose association is found<lb break="no"/>ed on justice and benevolence.</p>
                <p> <lb/>In reciprocating the kind wishes contained in <lb/>your address, be persuaded, that I offer a <lb/>sincere prayer for your present and future happi<lb break="no"/>ness."</p>
                <p><pb n="4"/><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">George-Town. April</hi>  30.</hi></p>
                <p>Yesterday morning, about one or two o'clock, <lb/>the ship Termagant, belonging to the house of <lb/>Messrs. Claggen, lying in the stream opposite <lb/>this town, was discovered on fire. The inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants of the town and the seamen in the harbour <lb/>speedily collected, but on account of a quantity <lb/>of powder that was on board, the efforts that o<lb break="no"/>therwise would have been exerted to extinguish <lb/>the flames were withholden. The first soon com<lb break="no"/>municated itself to the powder; and the explosion <lb/>was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the <lb/>houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of <lb/>the ship were flying in every direction, and it <lb/>and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting, <lb/>store and dwelling houses, on the water side, were <lb/>prevented from sharing a similar fate with the <lb/>ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse, <lb/>the property of Francis and Charles Loundes, si<lb break="no"/>tuated at some distance from the water, wherein <lb/>upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stor<lb break="no"/>ed, was several times, in different places, on fire, <lb/>ut happily extinguished without sustaining much <lb/>damage. The loss, occasioned by this alarming <lb/>element, must be great indeed, as the ship was <lb/>large and nearly new; besides, there were goods <lb/>to a considerable amount, and a pretty large sum <lb/>of money on board of her: all of which (except<lb break="no"/>ing a part of the money, which has since been <lb/>found) was destroyed. We are informed that <lb/>this accident proceeded from the steward's falling <lb/>to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cab<lb break="no"/>bin, which by some means or other, set fire to <lb/>the sails that were stowed there. It had got far <lb/>advanced before it was discovered. Providenti<lb break="no"/>ally no lives were lost.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pittsburgh, May</hi>  21. A letter received in this <lb/>town, on Sunday last, from Lieut. Jeffers, at <lb/>Fort Franklin, mentions, that an Indian had ar<lb break="no"/>rived there, who brought him intelligence that <lb/>300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations <lb/>had set out for war and that they were determin<lb break="no"/>ed to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio, near Pe<lb break="no"/>tersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing, but <lb/>their destination was not known.</p>
