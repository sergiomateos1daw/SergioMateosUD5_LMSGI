                <p>"Congress is still sitting at New York, and <lb/>from the multiplicity of business before them, <lb/>there is no likelihood of the session's soon closing. <lb/>We are curious to know what foreigners will say</p>
                <p><pb/>of our new commercial arrangements. Among <lb/>ourselves there is but one opinion, and that is fa<lb break="no"/>avourable. o our own vessels, a preference is <lb/>undoubtedly due; and among foreign vessels and <lb/>merchandise, there is no discrimination in our <lb/>import and tonnage acts, every nation being on <lb/>the same footing. With respect to the duties <lb/>themselves, they could not be laid lower, consi<lb break="no"/>dering the demand of supplies, which the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee appointed to give in an estimate state at <lb/>upwards of eight millions of dollars.</p>
                <p>"Accustomed to disappointment in hopes of <lb/>improvement in politics and commerce, we <lb/>feel a reluctance to entertaining very sanguine <lb/>wishes. Yet appearances encourage the expect<lb break="no"/>tion of the fâ€“deral government's acting with the <lb/>energy and effect that will give it respectability. <lb/>The prejudices and animosities created by the <lb/>late contest are gradually dying away ; and to <lb/>the idleness and dissipation flowing from the same <lb/>source, industry has in a great degree succeeded. <lb/>A progress has also been made in manufactures <lb/>of various kinds that was not expected ; and the <lb/>persevering in them affords a strong presumption <lb/>of those concerned deriving advantage.</p>
                <p>"Throughout the union, the public opinion <lb/>on matters of government has of late experien<lb break="no"/>ced rapid changes. Vice President Adams, in <lb/>his highly esteemed work, has fully demonstrated <lb/>the absurdity of democracy, and the superior ex<lb break="no"/>cellence of a mix form, such as that of Britain. <lb/>His deductions from premises admitted as just, <lb/>have abated much of the popular aversion to mo<lb break="no"/>narchy ; and as every thing matures quickly in <lb/>our transatlantic soil, it would not surprise many, <lb/>were United America to have a sovereign ear<lb break="no"/>in the next century.</p>
                <p>"In no one instance has our new admnistra<lb break="no"/>tion given general satisfaction, more than in their <lb/>conduct towards the Indians. The interests of <lb/>those unfortunate people will be studiously attend<lb break="no"/>ed to ; and they will be effectually protected a<lb break="no"/>gainst the lawless violence of the individuals or <lb/>States, who wished to wrest their lands from them. <lb/>This determination is dictated by policy as well <lb/>humanity ; for it is now become the interest of <lb/>the States to check, by every means short of <lb/>violence, the erratic disposition of their citizens, <lb/>who, when removed to the wilds beyond the <lb/>mountains, cannot be regarded as of any value, <lb/>in a political view.</p>
