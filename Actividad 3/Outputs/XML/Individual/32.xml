                <p><pb n="6"/>Mr. Ephraim Daniel, of Baker's-row, Mile<lb break="no"/>end, received the following letter from a friend <lb/>in Holland last week:</p>
                <p>"Sir, your friend Lâ€“y, who is just come here <lb/>from the East Indies, desires me to inform you, <lb/>that your unfortunate relation who left you with <lb/>the transports for Botany Bay, was well in Fe<lb break="no"/>bruary last. He has settled at Port Jackson, and <lb/>has leave to teach the children of some of your <lb/>nation to read and write in your own way. The <lb/>place is much improved since you ahve had any <lb/>letters form it, as there was no person without a <lb/>habitation, and being in some order, when he <lb/>left it. Except wearing apparel, very little is <lb/>wanting but business ; but you may thank the <lb/>Dutch at Batavia for it, as they have brought <lb/>several useful things there. The last crops of <lb/>corn, and the garden grounds, were in very good <lb/>condition : and what makes the settlement more <lb/>convenient, one of the people who came in the <lb/>first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for use <lb/>and ornament, as the clay is equally good as that <lb/>of Delft or elsewhere. He was surprised to see <lb/>so many people without hats or shoes, and houses <lb/>without windows, and full of wicker and rush <lb/>furniture, which is used in the place of almost <lb/>every thing else. If the smiths had a plentiful <lb/>supply of coal and iron, hardly any utensils would <lb/>be wanting. Your nephew has two children, and <lb/>says all that are born there are very healthy, and <lb/>more born than are buried or executed of grown <lb/>people. The Christians Church was quite finish<lb break="no"/>ed before he came away ; and he thinks if there <lb/>were enough of your people, they might have a <lb/>place to themselves. The farthest of the lines <lb/>was seldom visited by the savages ; and it was <lb/>reported when he came away, that as soon as <lb/>more troops and a new Governor comes over, <lb/>they would go farther than ever up the country, <lb/>when some valuable discovers are expected to be <lb/>made ; they have a gum which may be used for <lb/>gum arabic, which is veyr useful. He ex<lb break="no"/>pects several of your people will go from Batavia <lb/>to settle there very soon ; and wonders a way <lb/>for sending old clothes is not yet found out. <lb/>Norfolk Island is os thinly inhabited, that it is not <lb/>worth a stranger's while to land there ; and as lit<lb break="no"/>tle is said about it there, as if it was as far off as <lb/>Europe, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
