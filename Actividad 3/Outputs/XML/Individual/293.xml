                <p>Narrative of a Whaling Voyage Round <lb/>The Globe &amp;c. &amp;c By Frederick Debell <lb/>Bennett, Esq., F.R.G.S. 2 vols. London: <lb/>Richard Bentley.</p>
                <p>We have been somewhat disappointed in these <lb/>volumes. We expected to have found them, like <lb/>Scoresby's, full of interesting details regarding <lb/>whale fishing, whereas, there is hardly a word on <lb/>the subject throughout the whole of the first vo<lb break="no"/>lume, and very little in the second ; in fact, what <lb/>there is, is confined to a sort of supplementary ap<lb break="no"/>pendix. This is the more strange, that one of the <lb/>chief purposes of the author, as he himself informs <lb/>us, in undertaking this voyage, was to investigate <lb/>the anatomy and habits of southern whales, and <lb/>the mode of conducting the sperm whale fishery, <lb/>subjects which, he remarks, were then untouched <lb/>by the literature of any country. Yet, in the <lb/>work itself, this chief purpose dwindles into one <lb/>of very secondary prominence. This, the readers <lb/>of the work, at least most of them, will the more <lb/>regret, on finding how very curious and interest<lb break="no"/>ing are the two or three chapters which the author <lb/>has given on the subject of South Sea whaling. <lb/>There are full of entertaining details of both a <lb/>popular and scientific character, and cannot be <lb/>read without exciting a wish that larger portion <lb/>of the work had been composed of such material.</p>
                <p>In making these remarks, however, we are far <lb/>from intending to depreciate the sort of informa<lb break="no"/>tion, in the shape chiefly of sketches of the South <lb/>Sea Islands, to which the greater part of the vo<lb break="no"/>lumes are devoted ; we mean merely to say, that <lb/>it is not what we expected from the title of the <lb/>work, nor, we may add, what, for our own reading, <lb/>we should have preferred. Yet are these sketches <lb/>very amusing reading–full of graphic descriptions <lb/>and curious details of native character, which is <lb/>still found in the South Sea Islands in a state of <lb/>very primitive simplicity. "We have frequently <lb/>seen," says Mr Bennett, " amongst the congrega<lb break="no"/>gation assembled at Church (in Raiatea), a native <lb/>clothed in nothing but a shirt ; another with a <lb/>beaver hat surmounting a person naked except <lb/>the scanty maro ; and a third, whose whole attire <lb/>was a black coat, white neckerchief, and a shirt!"</p>
                <p>We observe a rather odd circumstance noted <lb/>by Mr Bennett. He says that the " temperate <lb/>ships" of America are the principal purveyors of <lb/>ardent spirits to the natives of the South Sea <lb/>Islands, carrying large quantities of rum thither <lb/>for the purposes of traffic! This is placing the <lb/>temperance principle in a somewhat curious pre<lb break="no"/>dicament.</p>
                <p>Another remark of the author's not less strik<lb break="no"/>ing–mark it well and take comfort from it ye <lb/><hi rend="italic">bon vivants[?]</hi>  of the civilzed world–is, that disease <lb/>is as abundant amongst the native islanders as <lb/>amongst the most refined of their species, and from <lb/>this concludes, that man in his savage state is as <lb/>liable to the " ills that flesh is heir to," as in his <lb/>civilised condition. Dr Johnson made a similar <lb/>remark regarding the Highlanders of Scotland ; <lb/>alleging that the London alderman lived as long <lb/>over his turtle feast, as the Highlander over his <lb/>paten cake. What degree of fellow-feeling with <lb/>civic dignitary and his good living, or whether <lb/>any, dictated this remark of the learned doctor, <lb/>we cannot say.</p>
                <p>Mr Bennett's work is written with great ability, <lb/>and in style whose only fault is exhibited in a <lb/>tendency, occasionally, to the use of rather learned <lb/>phraseology.</p>
                <p>We conclude with an extract from that portion <lb/>of the work which, from its great interest, we <lb/>regretted was not larger, but which, limited <lb/>as it is, is so full of curious information, and so <lb/>crowded with remarkable incident, as to render <lb/>the selection by no means an easy task.</p>
                <p>"Some sperm whales appear reluctant to employ <lb/>their tail when attacked, but prove active and danger<lb break="no"/>ous with their jaws. Such individuals often rather seek <lb/>than avoid the attacking boats, and, rushing upon them <lb/>with open mouth, employ every possible art to crush <lb/>them with their teeth, and, if successful, will sometimes <lb/>continue in their neighbourhood, biting the wreck and <lb/>oars into small fragments. When thus threatening a <lb/>boat, the whale usually turns and swings upon its back, <lb/>and will sometimes act in a very sluggish and unac<lb break="no"/>countable manner, keeping its formidable lower jaw <lb/>suspended for some moments over the boat, in a threat<lb break="no"/>ening attitude, but ultimately rolling to one side, and <lb/>closing its mouth harmlessly ; nor is it rare to observe <lb/>this whale, when pursued and attacked, retain[?] its mouth <lb/>in an expanded state for some minutes together. Such <lb/>threatening demonstrations of the jaw, as well as some <lb/>others with the flukes, occasionally compel a boat's <lb/>crew to leap into the water, and support themselves <lb/>by swimming or clinging to oars until the danger has <lb/>passed.</p>
                <p>"In the year 1835, the ship Pusie Hall encountered <lb/>a fighting whale, which after injuring and driving off <lb/>her four boats, pursued them to the ship, and withstood <lb/>for some time the lances hurled at it, by the crew, from <lb/>the bows of the vessel, before in could be induced to <lb/>retire ; in this affair a youth in one of the boats was <lb/>destroyed by a blow from the whale, and one of the <lb/>officers was severely lacerated by coming in contact <lb/>with the animal's jaw.</p>
                <p>"A highly tragical instances of the power and fero<lb break="no"/>city occasionally displayed by the sperm whale, is re<lb break="no"/>corded in the fate of the American South-Seaman <lb/>Essex, Captain G. Pollard. This vessel, when cruis<lb break="no"/>ing in the Pacific Ocean, in the year 1820, was wrecked <lb/>by a whale under the following extraordinary circum<lb break="no"/>stances. The boats had been lowered in pursuit of a <lb/>school of whales, and the ship was attending them to <lb/>windward. The master and second mate were engaged <lb/>with whales they had harpooned, in the midst of the <lb/>school, and the chief mate had returned on board to <lb/>equip a spare boat, in lieu of his own, which had been <lb/>broken and rendered unserviceable. While the crew <lb/>were thus occupied, the look-out at the masthead re<lb break="no"/>ported that a large whale was coming rapidly down <lb/>upon the ship, the mate hastened his task, in the <lb/>hope that he might be ready in time to attack it.</p>
                <p>"The Cachalot, which was of the largest size, con<lb break="no"/>sequently a male, and probably the guardian of the <lb/>school, in the meanwhile approached the ship so closely, <lb/>that the although the helm was put up to avoid the con<lb break="no"/>tact, he struck her a severe blow, which broke off a <lb/>portion of her keel. The enraged animal was then ob<lb break="no"/>served to retire to some distance, and again rush upon <lb/>the ship with extreme velocity. His enormous head <lb/>struck the starboard bow, beating in a corresponding <lb/>portion of the planks, and the people on board had <lb/>barely time to take to their boats, before the ship filled <lb/>with water and fell over on her side. She did not sink, <lb/>however, for some hours ; and the crew in the boats <lb/>continued near the wreck until they had obtained a <lb/>small supply of provisions, when they shaped a course <lb/>for land ; but here, it is to be regretted, they made a <lb/>fatal error. At the time the accident happened they <lb/>were cruising on the Equator, in the longitude of about <lb/>118[?] degrees West, with the Marquesan and Society <lb/>Islands on their lee, and might have sailed in their <lb/>boats to either of those groups in a comparatively short <lb/>time. Under an erroneous impression, however, that <lb/>all those lands were inhabited by an inhospitable race <lb/>of people, they preferred pulling to windward for the <lb/>coast of Peru, and in the attempt were exposed for a <lb/>lengthened period in extreme privations."</p>
                <p>A few Cachalots have been noted individually as <lb/>animals dangerous to attack. One was thus distin<lb break="no"/>guished on the cruising ground off the coast of New <lb/>Zealand, and was long know to whalers by the name <lb/>of 'New Zealand Tom.' He is said to have been of <lb/>great size, conspicuously distinguished by a white <lb/>hump ; and famous for the havoc he had made amongst <lb/>the boats and gear of ships attempting his destruction. <lb/>A second example, of cimilar celebrity, was known to <lb/>whalers in the Straits of Timor. He had so often <lb/>succeeded in repelling the attacks of his foes as to be <lb/>considered invincible, but was at length despatched by <lb/>a whaler, who, forewarned of his combative temper, <lb/>adopted the expedient of floating a cask on the sea, to <lb/>withdraw his attention from the boats ; but notwith<lb break="no"/>standing this <hi rend="italic">ruse</hi>  the animal was not destroyed with<lb break="no"/>out much hard fighting, nor until the bow of one of <lb/>the boats had been nipped off by his jaws."</p>
