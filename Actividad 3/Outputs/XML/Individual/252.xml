                <p><pb/><hi rend="italic">South Australia.</hi> –The act of Parliament for found<lb break="no"/>ing this colony will now come into full operation ; the <lb/>Commissioners having complied with the conditions <lb/>precedent, by the sale of t35,000 worth of land, and <lb/>by raisingthe required loan for the government of the <lb/>colony. We may therefore expect shortly to see the <lb/>names of the various officers gazetted (some of them <lb/>have been long ago nominated) ; and we understand <lb/>that active preparations are making with a view to the <lb/>immediate departure of the officers and a small body <lb/>of emigrants. This first expedition will be placed un<lb break="no"/>der the command of Captain Hindmarsh, R.N., the <lb/>Governor ; who, with the assistance of the Surveyors <lb/>and other qualified persons, will carefully examine the <lb/>various harbours in the colony, the quality of the <lb/>neighbouring soil, the supply of water, &amp;c. ; and will <lb/>select that site which, all things considered, is most <lb/>desirable for the first town. We believe it is the in<lb break="no"/>tention of the Commissions not to send out the main <lb/>body of emigrants until the next spring, so as to allow <lb/>ample time for the necessary preparations for their re<lb break="no"/>ception.– <hi rend="italic">Spectator.</hi></p>
                <p>There have been 300 convents suppressed within <lb/>the last three years. The example was set by the <lb/>Emperor of Russia, who, was by an ukase, dated 31st <lb/>July 1832, abolished 187 convents of monks. This <lb/>was followed by the King of Prussia, who, by a royal <lb/>order, secularised all the convents in the Duchy of <lb/>Posen. In 1834, Don Pedro put down 300 convents, <lb/>and Spain has lately abolished 1800.</p>
