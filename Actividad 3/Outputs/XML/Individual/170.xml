                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Proposed New Monarchy in  <lb/>South America</hi></p>
                <p>Accounts have beenreceived from Buenos Ayres, <lb/>by the Blossom sloop of War, of a curious nature.– <lb/>They relate to a project said to have been in agitation for <lb/>placing a Prince of the House of Bourbon at the head <lb/>of an independent Sovereignty on the River Plate.– <lb/>The circumstance has been brought to light by the late <lb/>changes in the Government of Buenos Ayres. From <lb/>the documents now published, and received by the <lb/>Blossom, it appears that in June, 1819. Gomez the <lb/>Envoy from Buenos Ayres, at Paris, was invited to a <lb/>conference by M. De Cazes, then French Minister for <lb/>Foreign Affairs, the object of which was to communi<lb break="no"/>cate a project of the French Cabinet for the colonsolida<lb break="no"/>tion of the Independent Government of South Ame<lb break="no"/>rica.</p>
                <p>This project, the French Minister observed, would <lb/>meet with the decided approbation of the Continental <lb/>Powers, especially Russia and Austria. Great Britain <lb/>might not like it, but yet would not find any good pre<lb break="no"/>tence for resisting it ; and his Catholic Majesty would <lb/>yield to the influence of all Europe with the better <lb/>grace, as his former dependencies would be only trans<lb break="no"/>ferred to a branch of his own family. The King of <lb/>France would furnish assistance of every king, and em<lb break="no"/>ploy every means, even to the supply of troops, for car<lb break="no"/>rying the affair into execution.</p>
                <p>On the 26th of October last, when the statement of <lb/>his conference reached Buenos Ayres, Rondeau, then <lb/>Director <hi rend="italic">ad interim</hi>  made a secret communication to <lb/>the Congress, and transmitted to them the letter of the <lb/>Envoy, together with the French memorial ; on the <lb/>following day, and on the 3d of November, the matter <lb/>was discussed in secret meetings, and the result was an[?] <lb/>opinion, that the Constitution lately-sworn allowed <lb/>no alteration to be made in the form of Government <lb/>till after the meeting of the Chambers. That a branch <lb/>of the Bourbon family, so closely connected with the <lb/>reigning Monarch of Spain, was in itself an insuperable <lb/>objection, as also the consideration that the Prince <lb/>proposed and supported by the Powers of the Euro<lb break="no"/>pean Continent, would naturally more incline towards <lb/>the views of his protectors than towards those of South <lb/>America, which ought to avoid all connexion with Eu<lb break="no"/>ropean continental politics ; and that Great Britain was <lb/>the power from which South America had most to <lb/>fear, and most to expect.</p>
                <p>It was at the same time suggested, that the Envoys in <lb/>Europe shoud put the communications from Paris in<lb break="no"/>to the hands of the British Minstry, whose good opi<lb break="no"/>nion and protection South America is most anxious to <lb/>conciliate.</p>
                <p>Our Cabinet has always treated the South Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans with the greatest reserve, as if feating contamina<lb break="no"/>tion by simple contact–a delicacy towards Spanish in<lb break="no"/>terests and feelings which appears in itself commenda<lb break="no"/>ble, but, when measured by the standard of national <lb/>benefit, may not merit the same praise. As it is, it <lb/>would seem that the British interest is likely to gain <lb/>the ascendacy in the river Plate, rather through the <lb/>disposition of the inhabitants, than from any influence <lb/>exerted by our Ministers.</p>
                <p>We shall only add, that thought the negotiation was <lb/>carried on by the Duke de Cazes, the project did not <lb/>originate with him, and did not at first apply to the <lb/>Prince de Lucca. It was intended as an opening for <lb/>one more nearly allied to the reigning family in <lb/>France.</p>
