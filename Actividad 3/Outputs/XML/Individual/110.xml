                <p>By the Dunlop, Captain Abrams, arrived on Sun<lb break="no"/>day last, at Greenock, from Quebec, after a passage <lb/>of 36 days, papers and letters have been received from <lb/>Canada, to the 19th, which contain an amount of an <lb/>engagement between a detachment of the British <lb/>force under Lieut.-Col. Morrison, consisting of the <lb/>49th[?] and 89th regiments, with some companies of <lb/>the Canadian militia, and a body of American troops, <lb/>amounting to 4000 men, which ended in the defeat <lb/>of the latter, with great loss. This action was pro<lb break="no"/>duced by the attempt of the American General to <lb/>advance to Montreal, from which it appears, how<lb break="no"/>ever, he has now begun to measure back his steps, <lb/>having crossed to the American side of the river <lb/>where the action was fought, and being actively pur<lb break="no"/> <lb/>sued in his retreat by the British troops.</p>
                <p>The following information has been received by <lb/>the Alexander, Captain Henry, which arrived at Li<lb break="no"/>verpool on Tuesday:–</p>
                <p>"Quebec, Nov. 26. 1813 <lb/>"The enemy's whole force was about 8000 men, <lb/>under the command of General Wilkinson. The <lb/>division commanded by General Boyd, consisting of <lb/>about 3000 to 4000 infantry, cavalry &amp;c. was alone <lb/>engaged upon the 11th instant.</p>
                <p>"The enemy lost in the action, Brigadier Gen. <pb/>Conington and Colonel Preston, killed–probably <lb/>600 men killed, wounded, and taken.</p>
                <p>"The consequence was a precipitate retreat across <lb/>the St Lawrence at Cornwall on the 13th, and eva<lb break="no"/>cuating the province. General Wilkinson marched <lb/>his troops into the Straits, the route of Plattsburgh, <lb/>leaving all his boats, upwards of 300, in the Salmon <lb/>river, where they were frozen in on the 16th, and <lb/>2000 men to protect them."</p>
                <p>Colonel Plenderleath came home in the Alexander, <lb/>with dispatches.</p>
