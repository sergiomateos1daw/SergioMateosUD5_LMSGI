                <p><pb n="2"/> As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at <lb/>the opening of the Congress of the <lb/>United States at New York, Nov. 6, gives an <lb/>impartial account of the situation of that count<lb break="no"/>try, we are persuaded it will be found not un<lb break="no"/>entertaining to our readers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the  <lb/>House of Representatives, </hi><lb/>IT is some aba<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>of the satisfaction, with <lb/>which I meet you on the present occasion, <lb/>that in felicitating you on a continuance of the <lb/>national prosperity, generally, I am not able to <lb/>add to it information that Indian hostilities, <lb/>which have for some time past, distressed our <lb/>western frontier, have terminated.</p>
                <p>You will, I am persuaded, learn, with no less <lb/>concern than I communicate it, that reiterated <lb/>endeavours, towards effecting a pacification, have <lb/>hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs <lb/>of preserving hostility on the part of the tribes <lb/>with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire <lb/>to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop <lb/>the further effusion of blood–to arrest the pro<lb break="no"/>gress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of <lb/>the nation, for peace, has led to strenuous efforts, <lb/>through various channels, to accomplish these de<lb break="no"/>sirable puposes:–In making which efforts, I <lb/>consulted less my own anticipations of the events, <lb/>or the scruples which some considerations were <lb/>calculated to inspire, than the wish to find the ob<lb break="no"/>ject attainable; to ascertain, unequivocally, the <lb/>such is the case.</p>
                <p>A detail of the measures which have been pur<lb break="no"/>sued, and of their consequences, which will be <lb/>laid before you, while it will confirm to you the <lb/>want of success, thu s far, will, I trust, evince <lb/>that means, as proper and as efficacious, as could <lb/>have been devised, have been employed. The <lb/>issue of some of them, indeed, is still depending; <lb/>but a favourable one, though not to be despaired <lb/>of, is not promised by any thing that has yet hap<lb break="no"/>pened.</p>
                <p>In the course of the attempts which have been <lb/>made, some valuable citizens have fallen victims <lb/>to their zeal for the public service. A sanction <lb/>commonly respected, even among savages, has been <lb/>found, in this instance, insufficient to protect <lb/>from massacre, the emissaries of peace; it will I <cb/>presume, be duly considered, whether the occasion <lb/>does not call for an exercise of liberality towards <lb/>the families of the deceased.</p>
                <p>It must add to your concern, to be informed, <lb/>what besides the continuation of hostile appearances <lb/>among the tribes north of the Ohio, some threat<lb break="no"/>ening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it.</p>
                <p> A part of the Cherokees, known by the name <lb/>of Chickamagas, inhabiting five villages on the <lb/><supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> river, have long been in the practice of <lb/>committing depredations on the neighbouring <lb/>settlements.</p>
                <p> It was hoped that the treat of Holston, made <lb/>with the Cherokee nation, in July 1791, would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. <lb/>But the event has not answered this hope. The <lb/>Chickamagas, aided by some banditti of another <lb/>tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated <lb/>wanton and unproved hostilities, upon the ci<lb break="no"/>tizens of the United States in that quarter.</p>
                <p> I have reason to believe, that every predictable <lb/>exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision <lb/>by law for that purpose) to be prepared for <lb/>the alternative of a prosecution of the war, in the <lb/>event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large <lb/>proportion of the troops authorized to be raised, <lb/>have been recruited, though the number is still <lb/>incomplete. And pains have been taken to disci<lb break="no"/>pline, and put them in condition for the particu<lb break="no"/>lar kind of service to be performed. A delay of <lb/>operations (besides being dictated by the measures <lb/>which were pursuing towards a pacific termin<lb break="no"/>tion of the war) has been in itself deemed prefe<lb break="no"/>rable to immature efforts. A statement, from the <lb/>proper department, with regard to the number <lb/>of troops raised, and some other points which <lb/>have been suggested, will afford more precise in<lb break="no"/>formation as a guide to the legislative consultations <lb/>and, among other things, will enable Congress to <lb/>judge whether some additional stimulus to the re<lb break="no"/>cruiting service may not be advisable.</p>
                <p>In looking forward to the future expence of <lb/>the operations, which may be found inevitable, I <lb/>derive consolation from the information I receive <lb/>that the product of the revenues for the present <lb/>year, is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community, for the service of the ensuing year. This however, will be bet<lb break="no"/>ter ascertained in the course of the session; and it <lb/>is proper to add, that the information alluded to <lb/>proceeds from the supposition of no material ex<lb break="no"/>tention of the spirit of hostilities.</p>
                <p> I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs, without again recommending to your considera<lb break="no"/>tion the expediency of more adequate provision <lb/>for giving energy to the laws throughout our in<lb break="no"/>terior frontier; and for restraining the commission <lb/>of outrages upon the Indians; without which all <lb/><supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> plans must prove nugatory. To enable by <lb/><supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>ent rewards the employment of qualified <lb/><supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> persons to reside among them, as agents, <lb/>would also contribute to the preservation of peace <lb/>and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients, an eligible plan could be devised for <lb/>promoing civilization among the friendly tribes, <lb/>and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale <lb/>equal to their wants, and under regulation calc<lb break="no"/>tion, its influence in cementing their interest <lb/>with ours could not but be considerable.</p>
                <p> The prosperous state of our revenue had been <lb/>intimated–This would be still more the case, <lb/>were it not for the impediments which in some<cb/>places continue to embarrass the collection of<supplied reason="copy curved">???</supplied> <lb/>duties on spirits, distilled within the United States.</p>
                <p>These impediments have lessened, and are<supplied reason="copy warpped">?ess???d</supplied> <lb/>in local extent; and as applied to the community <lb/>at large, the contentment with the law<supplied reason="copy missing">app???</supplied> to be progressive.</p>
                <p> But symptoms of increased opposition have <lb/>lately manifested themselves in certain quarters; <lb/>I judged special interposition on my part, proper <lb/>and adviseable, and under this impression have <lb/>issued a proclamation, warning against all unlaw<lb break="no"/>ful combinations and proceedings, having for this <lb/>object, or tending to obstruct the operation of <lb/>the law in question, and announcing that all law<lb break="no"/>ful ways and means would be strictly put in ex<lb break="no"/>cution, for bring to justice the infractors there<lb break="no"/>of, and securing obedience thereto.</p>
                <p> Measures have also been taken for the prosecu<lb break="no"/>tion of offenders. And Congress may be assured, <lb/>that nothing within constitutional and legal limits <lb/>which may depend on me, shall be wanting<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied><lb break="no"/>sert and maintain the just authority of the law. <lb/>In fulfilling this trust, I shall count entirely upon <lb/>the full co-operation of the other departments of <lb/>the government, and upon the zealous support of <lb/>all good citizens.</p>
                <p>I cannot forbear to bring again into the view <lb/>of the legislature the subject of a revision of the <lb/>judiciary system. A representation from the jud<lb break="no"/>ges of the supreme court, which will be laid be<lb break="no"/>fore you, points out some of the inconveniences <lb/>that are being experienced. In the course of the execu<lb break="no"/>tion of the laws, considerations rise out of the <lb/>structure of that system, which some cases,<supplied reason="copy warpped">???</supplied> <lb/>to relax their efficacy. As connected with the <lb/>subject provisions to facilitate the raking of<supplied reason="copy warpped">???</supplied> <lb/>upon processes out of the Courts of the United <lb/>States, and supplementary definition of offence, <lb/>against the constitution and laws of the union,<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> <lb/>of the punishment for such offences, will, it is pre<lb break="no"/>sumed, be found worthy of particular attention.</p>
                <p> Observations on the value of peace with other <lb/>nations are unnecessary; I would be wise, how<lb break="no"/>ever, by timely provisions, to guard against those <lb/>acts of our own citizens which might tend to dis<lb break="no"/>turb it, and to put ourselves in a condition<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> <lb/>give that satisfaction to foreign nations, which<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> <lb/>may sometimes have occasion to require from them.</p>
                <p> I particularly recommend to your considerations <lb/>the means of preventing those aggressions by our <lb/>citizens, on the territory of other nations, as <lb/>other infractions of the law of nations, which <lb/>furnishes just subject of complaint, might endan<lb break="no"/>ger our own peace with them. And, in general the <lb/>maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign <lb/>powers will be presented to your attention<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> <lb/>expiration of the law for that purpose which taken <lb/>place, if not re<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>, at the close of the present <lb/>session.</p>
                <p> In execution of the authority given by the leg<lb break="no"/>islature, measures have been taken for engage<lb break="no"/>ment of our mint–others have been employed at <lb/>at home. Provision has been made of the requisite <lb/>buildings, and therefore now putting into proper <lb/>condition for the purpose of the establishment. <lb/>There has also been a small beginning in the coin<lb break="no"/>age of half-dollars; the want of small coins in cir<lb break="no"/>culation call<supplied reason="copy blur">ing</supplied> the first attention to them.</p>
                <p> The regulation of some provision in the <lb/>law, which establishes the Post Office, open to <lb/>in experiment, against the transmission of news<lb break="no"/>papers to distant parts of the country.–Should <lb/>that, upon the enquiry, be found to be the fact, <lb/>a full conviction of the importance of facilitating <lb/>the circulation of political intelligence and infor <lb/>mation, will, I doubt not, lead to the application <lb/>of a remedy.</p>
                <p> The adoption of a constitution for the state of <lb/>Kentucky, has been notified to me. The legis<lb break="no"/>lature will share with me in the satisfaction which <lb/>arises from an event interesting to the happiness <lb/>of the part of the nation to which it relates, and <lb/>conducive to the general order.</p>
                <p>It is proper likewise to inform you, that since <lb/>my last communication on the subject, and in <lb/>further execution of the acts, severally making <lb/>provision for the public debt, and for the reduc<lb break="no"/>tion thereof, three new loans have been effected, <lb/>each for three millions of florins,—one at Ant<lb break="no"/>werp, at the annual interest of four and one-half <lb/>per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in <lb/>lieu of all charages.–The rates of these loans, and <lb/>the circumstance under which they have been made, ar confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad.</p>
                <p> Among the objects to which these funds have <lb/>been directed to be applied, the payment of the <lb/>debts due to certain foreign officers, according to <lb/>the provision made during the last session, has <lb/>been embraced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Gentlemen of the House of Representatives</hi>, </hi><lb/>I entertain a strong hope, that the state of the <lb/>national finances is now sufficiently matured to <lb/>enable you to enter upon a systematic and effect<lb break="no"/>tual arrangement for the regular redemption and <lb/>discharge of the public debt, according to the <lb/>right which has been reserved to the government <lb/>–no measure can be more desirable, whether view<lb break="no"/>ed with an eye to its intrinsic importance, or to <lb/>the general sentiment and wish of the nation.</p>
                <p> Provision is likewise requisite for the reimburse<lb break="no"/>ment of the loan which has been made for the <lb/>Bank of the United States, pursuant to the sec<lb break="no"/>tion of the act by which it is incorporated. In <lb/>fulfilling the public stipulations, in this particular, <lb/>it is expected a valuable saving will be made.</p>
                <p> Appropriations for the current service of the en<lb break="no"/>suing year, and for such extraordinaries as may <lb/>require provision, will demand, and I doubt not, engage your early attention.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives </hi>, </hi><lb/>I content myself with recalling your attention, <lb/>generally to such objects, not particularized in <lb/>my present, as have been suggested in my former <lb/>communications to you.</p>
                <p> Various temporary laws will expire during the <lb/>present sesssion. Among these, that which regu<lb break="no"/>lates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, <lb/>will merit your particular notice.</p>
                <p> The results of your common deliberations hi<lb break="no"/>therto, will, I trust, be productive of solide and <lb/>durable advantages to our constituentes; such as <lb/>by conciliating more and more their ultimate suf<lb break="no"/>frage, will tend to strength and confirm their <lb/>attachment, upon which, under Divine Providence, <lb/>materially depend their union, their safety, and <lb/>their happiness.</p>
                <p>Still further to promote and secure these inesti<lb break="no"/>mable ends, there is nothing which can have a <lb/>more powerful tendency, than the careful culti<lb break="no"/>vatino of harmony, combined with a due regard <lb/>to stability in the public councils.</p>
