What duty have I to pay upon <lb/>them?" Mr. Sibbly smiled, and told him, <lb/>"That he could receive no such money without <lb/>the Chairman's permission." Pray then (said <lb/>the stranger) speak to him of it as soon as possi<lb break="no"/>ble. I am resolved to pay whatever the duty is. <lb/>The Company pays for the exclusive privilege <lb/>of bringing India goods to Europe; the man <lb/>that deprives them of any part of the advantages <lb/>they hope to reap from it, cannot, in my opinion, <lb/>look upon himself as a strictly honest man." <lb/>Since the stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly, the <lb/>Chairman had not had time to give him an an<lb break="no"/>swer ; the stranger notwithstanding, gave him a <lb/>letter, including a Bank note of 30l. The sum <lb/>Mr. Sibbly told him he should pay, if he paid <lb/>any thing.</p>
