                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Walter</hi>  moved, pursuant to notice, that "an hum<lb break="no"/>ble address be presented to his Majesty, praying that he will <lb/>be graciously pleased to issue his royal orders that a placard <lb/>entitled "Emigration to Van Diemen's Land," which the se<lb break="no"/>veral postmasters throughout the kingdom have been directed <lb/>to put in a conspicuous place in their several post-offices, and <lb/>to circulate among the clergy and the parochial authorities <lb/>be withdrawn." He had been assured y several gentlemen <lb/>who had returned from Van Diemen's land, that many of the <lb/>young females sent out by the Emigration committee had <lb/>been irrevocable consigned to prostitution, and that such as <lb/>obtained services found themselves placed among a very dif<lb break="no"/>ferent calss of persons to that which they had been accustom<lb break="no"/>ed to mix with in this country. The hon. member read an <lb/>extract from a Hobart Town paper, of the 19th of February <lb/>last, in which it was stated that some of the females "thus <lb/>launched into the world," were not more than twelve of thir<lb break="no"/>teen years old.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Wakley</hi>  seconded the motion. <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir G. Grey</hi>  adverted to the extraordinary object of the <lb/>address, when the information desired had in fact already <lb/>been given on a former day. He hoped, whatever informa<lb break="no"/>tion, correct or erroneous, might be circulated on the subject <lb/>of emigration, that the people of England would not adopt <lb/>their notions from anonymous paragraphs in Hobart Town <lb/>newspapers. According to the hon. member there was a sys<lb break="no"/>tem in operation by which people were driven out of the <lb/>country–actually turned out of it, as if they were so many <lb/>slaves. Now he could declare that there could be no more <lb/>unfounded statement than this. Though much good had ari<lb break="no"/>sen to the colonies and individuals, yet it could not be denied <lb/>that, in some instances, youn women had turned out badly <lb/>They had these facts upon authority–that many of those fe<lb break="no"/>males obtained respectable places. The names of the indivi<lb break="no"/>duals who obtained them, the dates of their arrival, the <lb/>mode of their meployment, were all to be found int he papers <lb/>on the table of the house. In conclusion, he begged of the <lb/>hon. member and others, when statements relative to emi<lb break="no"/>gration were made, to receive them with caution and reserve.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr C. Lushington</hi>  defended the proceedigs of the Emi<lb break="no"/> <lb/>gration Committee. he mainted that by their labours the <lb/>greatest posible good had been accomplished, hear, hear.) <lb/>He would then ask of any one to look at the names of the gentle<lb break="no"/>men who were on that committee–to look at their charac<lb break="no"/>ters; and could any one who did so believe that the members <lb/>of that committee would be guilty of the sin of sendng out, <lb/>day after day, young females to the colonies–of thus duping <lb/>those unprotected creatures to their destruction? (hear, hear.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Walter</hi>  replied. He had not relied for his state<lb break="no"/> <lb/>ments upon newspapers, but upon official documents.</p>
                <p>The motion was negatived without a division.</p>
