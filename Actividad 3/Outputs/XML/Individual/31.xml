                <p>That the present Revolution in France is a con<lb break="no"/>sequence of the Revolution in America, cannot <lb/>admit of a doubt. The American Revolution o<lb break="no"/>riginated in Adams, a very insignificant Bosto<lb break="no"/>nian. Not that this Adams had the least expec<lb break="no"/>tation of American independence, when he fo<lb break="no"/>mented the opposition to the stamp-act; indeed <lb/>no human wisdom could possibly have foreseen <lb/>the subsequent folly and imprudence of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish administration and its obsequious Parliament. <lb/>An Administration so totally destitute of common <lb/>sense, so totally ignorant of every princple of <lb/>sound policy, no nation ever beheld. Adams had <lb/>the sagacity to avail himself of such despicable <cb/>policies.–Fortunately for the American cause, <lb/>the Generals that were sent from England were <lb/>of congenial abilities with the Minister, and the <lb/>Americans themselves were surprised at the faci<lb break="no"/>lity with which they acquired their independence. <lb/>–Yet all the blunders of the British administra<lb break="no"/>tion, and the miserable conduct of the British <lb/>Generals, would hardly have been sufficient to <lb/>emancipate America, notwithstanding her ex<lb break="no"/>treme weakeness, without the assistance of France; <lb/>and this assistance depended entirely on Dr. <lb/>Franklin being driven to Paris by the fatal-phi<lb break="no"/>lippic of a certain great lawyer. Such, therefore, <lb/>is the chain of concurrent circumstances that hath <lb/>overturned the French monarch. If the British <lb/>minister had possessed common sagacity–if he <lb/>could have distinguished a general from a corpo<lb break="no"/>ral; if Franklin had been treated with common <lb/>civility, America would have remained a British <lb/>colony, and France an absolute monarch, for <lb/>ages yet to come.</p>
