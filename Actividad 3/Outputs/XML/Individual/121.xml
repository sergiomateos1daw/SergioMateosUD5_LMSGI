                <p>[ Extracted from No.15 of Cobbet's Register, published on <lb/>Saturday, 12th instant ].</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cobbett's arrival in America</hi>,&amp;c.</p>
                <p>On Wednesday evening, the 27th March, <lb/>we embarked on board the Importer, D. <lb/>Ogden, master, bound to New York, where we <lb/>arrived on the 5th of May, with about 40 steer<lb break="no"/>age passengers, farmers, and tradesmen, who <lb/>were fleeing from ruin and starvation. In all re<lb break="no"/>spects that can be named our passage disa<lb break="no"/>greeable, and upon one occasion very perilous, <lb/>from lightning, which struck the ship twice, <lb/>shivered two of the masts, killed a man, struck <lb/>several people slightly, between two of whom I <lb/>was sitting, without at all feeling the blow.</p>
                <p>Some of our fellow-passengers have found <lb/>great disappointment ; and, it is stated in some <lb/>of the public papers here, that many hundreds <lb/>have, during the last year, accepted of the offer <lb/>of our Consul at New York to go and settle in <lb/>Canada. You know that I have never advised any <lb/>body to emigrate. I have always said that it is <lb/>no place for manufacturers ; no place for men to <lb/>live without work ; no place for a farmer who <lb/>does not work himself ; no place in short, for <lb/>any one who is not able and willing to work <lb/>at the ordinary sorts of work ; but for such <lb/>men there is every where a plentiful, happy, <lb/>and easy life. None should come, however, <lb/>who have any views of idleness ; and even <lb/>for the industrious poor, I see no reason why <lb/>they should expend their last shilling, and under<lb break="no"/>go all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage, <lb/>in order to save those who eat the taxes the ex<lb break="no"/>pence of their share of poor-rates ; a man and <lb/>his wife and a child or two cannot come under <lb/>the expence of 35 guineas, at least. A single <lb/>man 20 guineas, before he gets into work again ; <lb/>and, as I always said, I never would, if I were <lb/>in the place of such a man, expend my earnings <lb/>on a sea voyage, and endure all its hardships, <lb/>in order to remove one eye sore out of the way <lb/>of corruption. Besides, there is the climate, <lb/>which is not so good as ours, though it is not <lb/>bad, and people often live to an old age. The <lb/>country is good, but it will easily be conceived, <lb/>that new face, an entire new scene, a separa<lb break="no"/>tion from every friend, work done in a quite dif<lb break="no"/>ferent way from it is in England ; it will <lb/>easily be conceived, that all this makes such a <lb/>dislocation in a man's mind as to make him very <lb/>unhappy for a while. Then, he cannot expect <lb/>to find work the first day. He must ask first, at <lb/>any rate. Englishmen are sheepish ; and, they <lb/>are sure to find rascals enough here to foster <lb/>their disgust, merely for the sake of serving the <lb/>cause of corruption at home. In short, I advice <lb/>nobody to emigrate, but I will truly describe <lb/>the country and the people. As to emigrating with <lb/>a view of settling and farming in the new countries, <lb/>it is neither more nor less than downright mad<lb break="no"/>ness. It is what our English farmers know no<lb break="no"/>thing at all about ; it is what they are not at all <lb/>fit for ; and the far greater part of all such spe<lb break="no"/> <lb/>culations end in disappointment, if not in ruin <lb/>and premature death. I hope that our beloved <lb/>country will shortly be fit for an honest and in<lb break="no"/>dustrious man to live in ; but if any farmers come <lb/>with money in their pockets, my advice is, not <lb/>to give way either to enthusiastic admiration, or <lb/>to instant disgust. But, to stop a little ; to look <lb/>about them ; to see not only after good land, but <lb/>a good market for its products. The western <lb/>romance writers tell us, that the land in the <lb/>Ohio is too good ; but Mr Mellish, in his valu<lb break="no"/>able book, tells us, that beef and pork sell for <lb/>three halfpence a pound. An excellent coun<lb break="no"/>try for people who want to do nothing but eat. – <lb/>Give me Long Island, where the land is not too <lb/>good ; but where beef and pork sell for about <lb/>eightpence a pound (I speak of English money); <lb/>where good hay sells for five pounts a ton ; and <lb/>where there is a ready market for every species of <lb/>produce. One thing above all ; if an English far<lb break="no"/>mer (I mean by English, people of the whole of <lb/>the United Kingdom) comes here, with money <lb/>in his pocket, let him resolve to keep it there for <lb/>a year, and then he will be sure to do well. – <lb/>All that I see around me here is well calculated to <lb/>attract the attention and to please the sight of one, <lb/>like myself, brought up in the country, always <lb/>greatly delighted with, and somewhat skilled in, <lb/>various pleasing and healthful pursuits. The <lb/>The people are engaged busily in planting their In<lb break="no"/>dian corn. The cherry trees, of which there are <lb/>multitudes, planted in long avenues or rows, or <lb/>round the fields, have dropped their blossom and <lb/>begin to show their loads of fruit. The apple <lb/>and pear orchards, in extent from one to twenty <lb/>acres on each farm, are in full and beautiful <lb/>bloom. The farms are small in extent ; no ap<lb break="no"/>pearance of want amongst the labourers, who re<lb break="no"/>ceive, in the country, about two shillings and <lb/>threepence (our money) a-day, with board and <lb/>lodging, and which board consists of plenty of <lb/>excellent meat and fish of all sorts, the best of <lb/>bread, butter, cheese, and eggs. That you may <lb/>form some idea as to prices of living, I will state <lb/>a few facts, which have already come within my <lb/>own knowledge. We are at present at an inn, <lb/>thirteen miles from New York. It is on the <lb/>road to that city. Scarcely an hour in the <lb/>day passes without a carriage of some sort offer<lb break="no"/>ing for going thither, and to go by the regular <lb/>stage costs three shillings. Mind, I shall al<lb break="no"/>ways speak in English money, when I do not <lb/>speak of dollars. We lodge and board in <lb/>this inn, have each a bed-room and good <lb/>bed, have a room to sit in ourselves ; <lb/>we eat by ourselves ; and it really is eating. <lb/>– We have smoked fish, chops, butter, and eggs, <lb/>for breakfast, with bread (the very finest I ever <lb/>sa), crackers, sweet cakes ; and when I say <lb/>that we have such and such things, I do not <lb/>mean that we get them for show, or just enough <lb/>to smell to ; but in loads. Not an egg, but a <lb/>dish full of eggs. Not a snip of meat or of fish ; <lb/>but a plateful. Lump sugar for our tea and cof<lb break="no"/>fee ; not broke into little bits the size of a hazle <lb/>nut, but in good thumping pieces. For dinner, <lb/>we have the finest of fish, bass, mackerel, lob<lb break="no"/>sters ; of meat, lamb, veal, ham &amp;c. ; aspara<lb break="no"/>gus in plenty ; apple pieces (through in the middle <lb/>of May). The supper is like the breakfast, with <lb/>preserved peaches and other things. And with <lb/>all this an excellent cyder to drink, with the <lb/>kindest and most obliging treatment, on the part <lb/>of the landlord and landlady, and their sons and <lb/>daughters, we pay no more than 22s. 6d. a week <lb/>each. In England the same food and drink and <lb/>lodging at an inn would cost us nearly the same <lb/>sum every day. But there are two things which <lb/>no money can purchase any where. The first is, <lb/>no grumbling on the part of the landlady, except <lb/>on account of our eating and drinking too little ; <lb/>and the other is, that Mr Wiggins has no fasten<lb break="no"/>ing but a bit of chip run in over the latch of the <lb/>door, to a house which is full of valuable things <lb/>of all sorts, and about which we leave all our things <lb/>much more carelessly than we should do in our <lb/>own house in any part of England. Here, then <lb/>are we able to live at an inn, one of the most <lb/>respectable in the whole country, at the rate of <lb/>fifty pounds a year, while the pay of a common <lb/>farming man is not much short of that sum.</p>
