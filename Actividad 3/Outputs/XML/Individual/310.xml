                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">New Zealand.</hi></p>
                <p>( <hi rend="italic">From the Morning Chronicle.</hi>.</p>
                <p>The dinner given on Saturday by the New Zea<lb break="no"/>land Company to Lord John Russell will serve to re<lb break="no"/>move all apprehensions, if any are yet entertained, <lb/>with regard to the relations between that colony and <lb/>the Government of the parent state. Many of the first <lb/>names in the country honoured this splendid banquet <lb/>by their presence ; and men of all parties, Tories, <lb/>Whigs, and Radicals, appeared to be actuated only <lb/>by one common feeling.</p>
                <p>The public are now tolerably familiar with the <lb/>natural advantages of New Zealand, which appears <lb/>destined to be in the Souther Ocean what Great <lb/>Britain is in the Northern. Lord Ashburton, with <lb/>must felicity, observed, " that the position of the New <lb/>Zealand islands on the map, their climate, fertility, <lb/>abundant harbours surrounded with the seas most <lb/>suited to the whale fisheries, and, above all, the <lb/>character to the native population, led him to antici<lb break="no"/>pate that these islands were likely to become the <lb/>great seat of wealth and naval power." Lord John <lb/>Russell was justly complimented, on all hands, for <lb/>adding these important islands to the great colonial <lb/>empire of this country.</p>
                <p>The speech of Lord John Russell was much and <lb/>deservedly applauded.</p>
                <p>"I believe," said his lordship, "that the foundation <lb/>of this colony of New Zealand will tend to the honour <lb/>and dignity of the Crow, and will tend to the pros<lb break="no"/>perity and future greatness of the nation (cheers). It <lb/>was on this ground, and for these reasons, that I lent <lb/>my humble efforts in support of those exertions that <lb/>had been made, and were about to be made, by the <lb/>New Zealand Company. Gentlemen, in so doing, I <lb/>should be unworthy of your approbation if I took <lb/>any extraordinary merit to myself ; for, in the <lb/>first place, the principle of colonization, the value of <lb/>colonies to this country, the means they afford of aug<lb break="no"/>menting her strength, of adding to her power, of pro<lb break="no"/>moting her wealth, and of increasing her prosperityâ€“ <lb/>all this has been ascertained and demonstrated by the <lb/>enlightened discussions of past years (hear, hear). With <lb/>regard to the best mode of colonization, likewise, we <lb/>have had the advantage and assistance of the most en<lb break="no"/>lightened opinions, and the most adverse discussion <lb/>I, therefore, can only take to myself the merit of not <lb/>being blind to the importance and value of those opi<lb break="no"/>nions and discussions (hear, and cheers)"</p>
                <p>But though his lordship speaks thus humbly of his <lb/>own merits, in recommending the adoption of these <lb/>islands by the Crown, it was perfectly well understood <lb/>by all present that, for his conduct with respect to <lb/>his colony, he has truly entitled himself to the grati<lb break="no"/>tude of his country. Lord Ashburton only paid him <lb/>a deserved tribute when he complimented him for the <lb/>sagacity with which he had appreciated the import<lb break="no"/>ance of these islands, so soon as he had entered on the <lb/>administration of colonial affairs, and for the judicious <lb/>measure of setting up the British flag in them.</p>
                <p>We may observe that the health of her Majesty's <lb/>Ministers, proposed by Mr Hutt, M.P., was received <lb/>with loud and universal cheering, and that Mr La<lb break="no"/>bouchere's speech, which was a very good one, was <lb/>well received. Upon the whole, Lord John's visit to <lb/>the City on this occasion is calculated to gain the <lb/>Government favour among the commercial classes. <lb/>His lordship may well be proud, that though New <lb/>Zealand was formally taken possession of in the name <lb/>of the Sovereign of this country many years ago, it <lb/>was reserved for him to make it a British colony.</p>
