                <p><pb n="7"/> We have this day received Quebec newspapers <lb/>down to the 24th May, from which the following <lb/>is extracted:–</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Quebec, May</hi>  20.</hi></p>
                <p>We hear late accounts from Niagara mention, <lb/>that the Indians in that quarter are much alarm<lb break="no"/>ed in consequence of a message said to be received <lb/>by them from the States, that they had now rais<lb break="no"/>ed an army to take their own for Niagara, and <lb/>that two thousand men of that army were now on <lb/>their way from New York–desiring the Indians <lb/>to lye still and look on, and that they would pu<lb break="no"/>nish those that should interfere.</p>
                <p>It was also said, that the people of New York <lb/>were determined of themselves to lay open the post <lb/>of Oswego, and that emissaries had been employ<lb break="no"/>ed to persuade the Indians they would be greatly <lb/>benefited by that event.</p>
                <p>We are rather inclined to believe the Indians <lb/>are too sensible of the great benefits already con<lb break="no"/>ferred upon them by our neighbours in buying <lb/>their lands from them, to think of accepting any <lb/>more from that quarter, and we would recom<lb break="no"/>mend it to the new-born Sovereignty on this side <lb/>the Atlantic, before they testify their impatience, <lb/>that national treaties, like private agreements, are <lb/>not to be infringed by one and performed by the <lb/>other party–Pay and you shall receive.</p>
                <p>[As to the Americans making an attempt up<lb break="no"/>on Niagara, they have long had it in contempla<lb break="no"/>tion to get possession of <hi rend="italic">our posts</hi>  upon the lakes <lb/>in Canada.]</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">May</hi>  24.</hi></p>
                <p>The concerned in the ship Columbia and sloop <lb/>Washington, have received letters from the Captain <lb/>Kendrick, dated at Nootka in July last; he in<lb break="no"/>forms them, that he passed the winter preceding <lb/>on the north-west coast of America; that he was <lb/>then bound on a voyage further northward, and <lb/>from thence intended to proceed to Canton.– <lb/>The letters were forwarded to Mexico by a Spa<lb break="no"/>nish fleet that had been at Nootka, and from thence <lb/>to the Spanish Charge des Affaires at New York. <lb/>They were covered to the President of the United <lb/>States of America.</p>
                <p>[From what appeared in our paper of Friday <lb/>last, <hi rend="italic">(see Glasgow Intelligence, p</hi>. 424 <hi rend="italic">)</hi>  and what is <lb/>mentioned above, it seems very probable that the <lb/>affair of <hi rend="italic">Nootka Sound</hi>  had been a preconcerted <lb/>scheme between the Americans and Spaniards, <lb/>as Capt. Kendrick addresses his dispatches for the <lb/>President of the States without making the least <lb/>mention (from what is made public) of any <hi rend="italic">Bri<lb break="no"/>tish ships</hi>  being then at Nootka Sound.]</p>
