Gorham and <lb/>Phelps–That they were met by Mr. Phelps <lb/>and the principal inhabitants of Conadoque, four <lb/>miles from that place, and conducted into town <lb/>–That they were highly gratified with the treat<lb break="no"/>ment they received, and with the manner in which <lb/>they had disposed of their lands.–The gentle<lb break="no"/>man further informs, that there is now about <lb/>3000 inhabitants in the above county, and that <lb/>the land is of a good quality.</p>
