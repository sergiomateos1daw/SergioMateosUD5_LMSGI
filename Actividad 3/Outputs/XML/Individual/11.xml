                <p><pb n="2"/>The old system of sending men of rank to go<lb break="no"/>vern Jamaica, seems to be revived, and laudably <lb/>too.</p>
                <p>This island is the most important possession we <lb/>hold in the West Indies, and is well entitled to <lb/>any mark of distinction which the parent country <lb/>can bestow upon it.</p>
                <p>The salary and emoluments annexed to the <lb/>government of Jamaica, render it the most valua<lb break="no"/>ble of any in the King's gift, except that of Ire<lb break="no"/>land.</p>
                <p>Soon after the Restoration, O'Brian, third <lb/>Earl of Inchiquin, was appointed Governor of <lb/>Jamaica, and died in his Government.</p>
                <p>Henry Bentinck, first Duke of Portland, was <lb/>made Governor of this island in the reign of <lb/>George I. His Grace died at Spanish Town, <lb/>July 4th, 1736, in the 45th year of his age.</p>
                <p>The death of these two Noblemen in their <lb/>government, gave so bad an impression of the cli<lb break="no"/>mate of Jamaica, and the insalubrity of its air, <lb/>that few persons of rank and fortune have been <lb/>ambitious of becoming governors of it, notwith <lb/>standing the brilliancy of the appointments an <lb/>nexd to the situation.</p>
