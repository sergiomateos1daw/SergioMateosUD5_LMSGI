                <p><pb/><hi rend="italic">The Machine Breakers.</hi> â€“A convict ship at Ports<lb break="no"/>mouth is on the point of sailing for Van Diemen's <lb/>Land, with between two and three hundred convicts on <lb/>board, who have been lately convicted for machine<lb break="no"/>breaking, extorting money, and other offences com<lb break="no"/>mitted in the disturbed counties. Another ship, with <lb/>convicts of the same description, will be dispatched for <lb/>New South Wales, in about a fortnight. These con<lb break="no"/>victs have been kept entirely separate from all other <lb/>prisoners, and an accurate report will be made to the <lb/>Governors of the Colonies, as to their former character, <lb/>their trades and employments, and the recommenda<lb break="no"/>tions which have been made in their favour subsequent<lb break="no"/>ly to their trials. The capital convicts whose lives <lb/>have been spared, are to be transported for life; and <lb/>the convicts, sentenced and recommended by the Judges <lb/>for transportation, are to be transported according to <lb/>their respective sentences.</p>
