It is not <lb/>long since a couple, who had imbided the tender pas<lb break="no"/>sion, were linked in the bonds of matrimony in it ; and <lb/>a like consumnation, most devoutly to be wished for <lb/>by another pair of inmates, would ere now have taken <lb/>place, did not envious bolts and bars intervene, for a <lb/>petition has been presented by two delinquents of dif<lb break="no"/>ferent sexes, both under sentence of transportation, to <lb/>the Magistrates, praying that they may be allowed to <lb/>marry before setting out for New South Wales. The <lb/>fond pair never saw each other till inclosed in the same <lb/>vehicle on their way to stand trial at last Perth Circuit, <lb/>for capital offences ; yet, in this situation, love–omni<lb break="no"/>potent love–took the captives captive, and rendered <lb/>them in its enjoyment, even in their perilous plight, <lb/>"o'er a' the ills o' life victorious." But, alas! " the <lb/>course of true love never did run smooth;" and no less <lb/>a personage than the Secretary of State for the Home <lb/>Department has in this case crossed the path of the hap<lb break="no"/>less couple, and doomed them to single blessedness for <lb/>many a year, by ordering the "fair penitent" to be re<lb break="no"/>moved to Penitentiary at Millbank for seven years, <lb/>instead of transportation for fourteen ; leaving the for<lb break="no"/>lorn lover to seek consolation in the charms of some <lb/><hi rend="italic">sterling</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">currency</hi>  damsel in the land of promise, to <lb/>which he must now wend his solitary way.– <hi rend="italic">Fife Hld.</hi></p>
