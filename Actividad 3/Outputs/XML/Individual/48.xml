                <p><pb/>The Minister is now said to be employed in <lb/>drawing up two plans, which will give rise to <lb/>very warm debates in Parliament : one is for set<lb break="no"/>tling a commercial arrangement between Great <lb/>Britain and Ireland ; the other for giving a con<lb break="no"/>stitution to Canada. In feeling the former, the <lb/>Minister will have to contend with strong com<lb break="no"/>mercial prejudices; in the latter, he will have to <lb/>encounter religious principles. The British <lb/>settlers in Canada are comparatively few in num<lb break="no"/>ber. The great bulk of the Canadians are the <lb/>descendants of French, and are Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lics. The former are Protestants.</p>
                <p>Fleaury in france, and Walpole in England, <lb/>were not fonder of peace than Mr. Pitt. Con<lb break="no"/>quests may be made by war, but consequence and <lb/>wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system, <lb/>if the first commercial nation in the world.</p>
                <p>Besides these considerations, the grand secret <lb/>has been discovered since the present Minister <lb/>came into power, that the best riddance England <lb/>ever had, was of her American Colonies ; because <lb/>by this means, she becomes thoroughly collected <lb/>at home, to oppose every foreign power, without <lb/>the expence and blood of supporting the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans, at the same time that they cannot do with<lb break="no"/>out BRitish manufactures in one line or another.</p>
                <p>Thus, they are under the necessity of protect<lb break="no"/>ing themselves, at the same time, that, like the <lb/>rest of Europe, they are obliged to resort to our <lb/>superior mercantile market.</p>
                <p>Application has been lately made to the Lords <lb/>of the Treasury for an order on the Bank to issue <lb/>some of the new silver coin, in aid of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent want of silver for circulation, the scarcity <lb/>of which is much felt by retail traders in par<lb break="no"/>ticular.</p>
