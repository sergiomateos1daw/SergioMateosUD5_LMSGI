Esq. to the <lb/>Chair.

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">York, Upper Canada, Feb. 6. </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Tex v. The Earl of Selkirk and others</hi></p>
                <p>A bill of indictment, for a conspiracy to ruin the <lb/>trade of the North West Company, and impoverish the <lb/>partnes thereof, was found by the Grand Jury, against <lb/>Thomas Douglas, Early of Selkirk ; J. B. Chevalier de <lb/>Lorimer, Captain in his Majesty's Indian Department ; <lb/>Captain Pratais D'Orsonnens, late of the De Meuron <lb/>Regiment ; Captain Frederick Matthey, ditto ; Lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant G. A. Fauche, ditto ; Lieutenant Frederick <lb/>Graffenrad, ditto ; Serjeant Jacob Vichie, ditto ; Cap<lb break="no"/>tain Miles Macdonnel, late of the Canadian Fecibles ; <lb/>Lieutenant Alexander Bridport Beecher, late of the <lb/>Royal Navy ; Doctor John Allen, John Spencer, Do<lb break="no"/>nald Macpherson, James Chatelain, John M'Nab, Ar<lb break="no"/>chibald Macdonald, and John P. Bourke.</p>
                <p>The indictment contains three counts ; and amongst <lb/>the numerous overt acts therein set forth, support<lb break="no"/>ed by documentary and oral evidence, the following <lb/>were particularly prominent :– The engaging and ar<lb break="no"/>mind a number of disbanded soldiers (foreigners) ; the <lb/>entry of them, by force of arms, into Fort William, <lb/>in August, 1816 ; retaining possession of the fort till <lb/>May 1817 ; sending off as prisoners the partners of <lb/>the North West Company found there ; getting rid of <lb/>the clerks, by subpoenas to appear at York at a period <lb/>when no courts are held there, without ever inquiring <lb/>whether they know anything of the matters to which <lb/>the subpoenas related, and without ever bringing them <lb/>forward afterwards ; stopping of the outfits from going <lb/>into the interior, and the returns from coming into <lb/>Montreal ; possessing themselves of all the books and <lb/>papers of the concern ; sending away the principal <lb/>clerk under a charge of felony, without examination, <lb/>and without having ever followed up the charge ; the <lb/>pretended sale, by Daniel Mackenzie, of the North <lb/>West property, obtained by his Lordship by means of <lb/>continued duress ; tampering with, and debauching the <lb/>North West Company's servants, and commanding <lb/>them in the King's name ; writing circular letters to <lb/>the partners and clerks in the interior country, advis<lb break="no"/>ing them to abandon their trust, alleging that the <lb/>North West Company were ruined, and to carry the <lb/>furs to Hudson's Bay ; taking possession of Fort Lake <lb/>La Pluie, and the property there, and stopping the na<lb break="no"/>vigation, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Upon this being returned a true bill the Attorney<lb break="no"/>General moved the process of the Court against the <lb/>parties ; and Dr Allen being present, was to be ar<lb break="no"/>raigned the following day.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Wm Smith v. The Earl of Selkirk</hi></p>
                <p>This was a civil action brough by Mr Wm Smith <lb/>against Lord Selkirk for false imprisonment.</p>
                <p>It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was under<lb break="no"/>sheriff of the Western District, and as such, the bear<lb break="no"/>er of a writ of restitution founded upon a verdict of a <lb/>special jury at Sandwich, in October 1816, and grant<lb break="no"/>ed by the Magistrate, ordering the restoration of Fort <lb/>William to the North West Company. He was also <lb/>the bearer of a warrant, for felony, issued against his <lb/>Lordship, Dr Allen, Captain Matthey, and others, u<lb break="no"/>pon an information upon oath before a justice of the <lb/>Peace. Mr Smith got to Fort William on the 19th of <lb/>March 1817, and produced his writ of restitution, <lb/>with which his Lordship refused to comply ; and when <lb/>the Earl and others were arrested by Mr Smith, upon <lb/>the warrant for felony, his Lordship laid hold of him <lb/>and pushed him out of doors ; and he was afterwards <lb/>kept in close custody in the fort under a military guard. <lb/>A circumstance which added much to the grievous na<lb break="no"/>ture of the offence, and which was particularly dwelt <lb/>upon by the Judge, in his charge to the Jury, was, that <lb/>whilst Mr Smith was kept in a rigorous confinement, <lb/>Charles de Reinhard, though under an accusation of <lb/>was at large and keeping a school, though no<lb break="no"/>minally under the surveillance of one or two of his for<lb break="no"/>mer comrades. The Chief Justice also remarked upon a<lb break="no"/>nother part of the evidence for the defence, by which <lb/>it appeared that the only option left to Mr Smith to ob<lb break="no"/>tain his liberty was that of abandoning his duty, and <lb/>breaking his oath of office, by a promise not to molest <lb/>Lord Selkirk. Mr Smith, however, notwithstanding <lb/>this proposal, persisted in doing his duty, and was not <lb/>liberated until the evacuation of Fort William by his <lb/>Lordship and his forces in May, 1818.</p>
                <p>The Jury after some deliberation, returned a verdict <lb/>in favour of the plaintiff.– Damages L.500 Halifax <lb/>currency.</p>
                <p>After narrating the military parages, &amp;c. at Rich<lb break="no"/>mond, in America, in honour of the 22d of February, <lb/>a journal says, " A melancholy catastrophe closed the <lb/>day. Colonel W. Tatham, so well known in England <lb/>and this country, for his acquaintance with civil engi<lb break="no"/>neering.–who has been residing in this city for two or <lb/>three years, but whose utility was considerably arrested <lb/>by an unfortunate habit to which he had become ad<lb break="no"/>dicted–was destined on that day to breathe his last.– <lb/>In a moment of intemperance, as he stood by the piece <lb/>of artillery which was firing the evening salute, he ex<lb break="no"/>claimed that he wished to die. As the second gun was <lb/>about to fire, and immediately after the commanding <lb/>had given the word " Fire!" Conolonel Tatham <lb/>presented himself in front of the muzzle of the piece, <lb/>and by its discharge his abdomen was almost literally <lb/>blown to pieces. His body was raised a few feet in the <lb/>air by the explosion, and he fell upon his face without <lb/>uttering one word that was heard by the byestanders.– <lb/>Colonel Tatham died without any family. Circum<lb break="no"/>stances had strip life of much of its attractions in his <lb/>eyes ; but it is impossible not to regard the manner of <lb/>his death with horroer, and to feel the deepest commi<lb break="no"/>seraton for his melancholy fate. He was a man of <lb/>great information, of great genius, and of great re<lb break="no"/>source of mine. But to this melancholy end he has <lb/>arrived."</p>
