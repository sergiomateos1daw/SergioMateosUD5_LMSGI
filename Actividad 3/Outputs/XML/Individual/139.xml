                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Leeds, </hi><hi rend="italic">April</hi>  19.–We have been somewhat alarmed here <lb/>to-day, though no bad consequences have followed, by a most <lb/>numerous assemblage of croppers, cloth-dressers, and other <lb/>artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep com<lb break="no"/> <lb/>ing in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley, Arm<lb break="no"/>ley, Holbeck, and all the neighbouring towns and villages <lb/>and it is computed that at one time there were full three <lb/>thousand of these distressed people assembled, chiefly in Brig<lb break="no"/>gate. As many of them marched into the town with great <lb/>sticks in their hands, they created some little alarm, but their <lb/>conduct was uniformly peaceable; their complaints were not <lb/>loud, though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and <lb/>Magistrates, with the whole of the Civil Power, were in rea<lb break="no"/> <lb/>diness to act as circumstances might require; but, fortunately, <lb/>there was not the slightest occasion for their interference. <lb/>By far the greater number of the assemblage dispersed by noon, <lb/>and returned to their respective homes. Several respectable <lb/>gentlemen went among them, to ascertain the motives of <lb/>their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it does not ap<lb break="no"/>pear that they have the least disposition to commit any breath <lb/>of the peace ; but in fact, the people know not what to do <lb/>in their present state of distress. I understand that an active <lb/>subscription is going, to enable a number of these poor <lb/>men to proceed to Canada; and others are said to have ex<lb break="no"/>pressed their wish to be sent to Botany Bay, provided they <lb/>can obtain the sanction of Government. The case of these <lb/>people is a very perplexing one ; for their numbers augment <lb/>daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chester, </hi><hi rend="italic">April</hi>  19.–John Bagguely, John Drummond <lb/>and Samuel Johnson, convicted of sedition on the 15th inst., <lb/>were this day, after an adrdress from the Chief-Justice (Mr <lb/>Serjeant Copley,) sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and <lb/>to find security for their good behaviour for two years, each <lb/>in L.500 himself with sureties in L.100 each.</p>
                <p>We are sorry to hear that great number of the agricultu<lb break="no"/>ral poor are out of employ in Monmouthshire, and that the <lb/>amount of wages diminishes as works get scarcer. Emigra<lb break="no"/>tion to America still continues; but it is, for the most part, of <lb/>a description of person who have afforded employ to others <lb/>rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some <lb/>property with them.</p>
                <p>Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States, there <lb/>are twenty six persons belonging to one family, (Quakers, of <lb/>the name of Thistlewaith,) lately residing in Meadow lane, <lb/>Leeds. These industrious and enterprising individuals are <lb/>gone with an intention of carrying on the woollen manufac<lb break="no"/>ture (in conjunction with others) on an extensive scale, ei<lb break="no"/>ther at Philadelphia or some other more eligible site in its <lb/>vicinity. Several other families are preparing to emigrate <lb/>from the same neighbourhood, as well as from Dewsbury, <lb/>Bradford, and other places in the vicinity. It is true these <lb/>extensive emigrations may, in some degree, contribute to re<lb break="no"/>lieve our overburdened population ; but they must likewise <lb/>tend, in an equal ratio, to impoverish the nation ; as every <lb/>individual and family who emigrate, setting aside the pecu<lb break="no"/>niary wealth they carry with them, take what is of far more <lb/>consequence to a commercial nation–their talents and in<lb break="no"/>dustry–articles, at present, of comparative small value in the <lb/>country.</p>
                <p>The very heavy impost which is at present levied upon au<lb break="no"/>thors and publishers, by being compelled, under the existing <lb/>Copyright Act to deliver eleven copies of every book publish<lb break="no"/>ed to certain public libraries, is likely to be repealed by a Bill <lb/>to be brought into Parliament in a few days. The body of <lb/>evidence taken before the Select Committe of the House of <lb/>Commons last year, forms a most interesting display of the <lb/>state of literary property in this country.</p>
                <p>Saturday last Mr Stuart and Mr Allsop were returned for <lb/>the Borough of Camelford.</p>
                <p>Yesterday, the Grand Jury for the County of Middlesex <lb/>found two Bills of Indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury <lb/>against five of the principal witnesses produced in behalf of <lb/>the petitioner, who were examined before the Select Com<lb break="no"/>mittee appointed to try the merits of the election fo Penrhyn.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Extraordinary Legacy.</hi> –A very singular cause is now de<lb break="no"/>pending before the Court of Session in Scotland, respecting a <lb/>legacy to the amount of upwards of <hi rend="italic">fifty thousand pounds,</hi> be<lb break="no"/>queathed by the late Earl of F. (who died at Berlin) to a fo<lb break="no"/>reigner, who was one of his domestic servants. The payment <lb/>of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the late Earl, <lb/>on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consi<lb break="no"/>deration ; and from its novelty the case is, of course, the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of much conversation in the Northern Metropolis. The <lb/>arguments and pleadings in this extraordinary suit, in which <lb/>the most eminent counsel of the Edinburgh Bar are engaged, <lb/>display much classical as well as legal learning ; but no judg<lb break="no"/>ement has yet been pronounced by the Court. From the mag<lb break="no"/>nitude of the sum in dispute, it will probably be finally de<lb break="no"/>termined by an appeal to the House of Lords.– <hi rend="italic">Morn. Chron.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Town Hall, Southwark.</hi> –Thomas Wing was brought up by <lb/>Reeve, the Marshalman, and examined before Sir John Earner[?], <lb/>the sitting Magistrate, charged on suspicion of robbing his em<lb break="no"/>ployers, Messrs Sentance and Flint, grocers, NO. 300. Borough, <lb/>High-street.</p>
                <p>The prisoner's detection was caused in the following singu<lb break="no"/>lar manner :–He was porter to the prosecutors, and was fre<lb break="no"/>quently about the shop ; a large house dog having seen him <lb/>take money from the till, which he tied in his pocket hand<lb break="no"/>kerchief, followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a <lb/>shed near the stables, and then he came into the shop and ap<lb break="no"/>peared quite restless, pulling every person by the skirt[?] and <lb/>apparently wishing them to follow him. At length Henry <lb/>Heydon, the apprentice, having occasion to go to the stable, <lb/>the dog followed him, and having drawn his attention to the <lb/>heap of rubbish, under which the money was buried, began to <lb/>scratch at it till he brought the booty to view ! The appren<lb break="no"/>tice brought it to his master, who counted, and found it to <lb/>contain 12s. in copper coin. After marking it he desired the <lb/>boy to place it in the same spot, which he did, and soon af<lb break="no"/>terwards, finding that it was removed, he asked the prisoner <lb/>some questions about it, but he declared his ignorance of the <lb/>whole transaction. Reeve, the Marshalman, was then sent <lb/>for, who, on searching the prisoner, found some of the marked <lb/>ballpence[?] in his pocket.–Remanded. <cb/><hi rend="italic">Bank Committee.</hi> –The Opposition Journals, last wek, as<lb break="no"/>serted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House of <lb/>Commons intend to report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of <lb/>paying in specie. That is, the Bank shall pay next January <lb/>in gold bars at the present price of gold, L.4 1s. per ounce, <lb/>any quanitity of notes not being less than sixty or a hundred <lb/>pounds' worth, and that in two years afterwards they shall <lb/>pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold, L.3, 17s. <lb/>10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's plan goes farther. It re<lb break="no"/>commends that the Bank shall never pay in coin, but in bars <lb/>of gold, at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall <lb/>at all times buy gold, when offered, at L.3, 17s. and sell it, <lb/>when demanded, at L.3, 17s. 10 1/2d.</p>
                <p>If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the <lb/>Restriction Committee intend to report in favour of payments <lb/>in bullion at the market price ; and should Parliament adopt <lb/>that plan ; then there will be a very great saving to the na<lb break="no"/>tion in the expense of coinage, the waste of, &amp;c. All <lb/>the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in fo<lb break="no"/>reign commerce, will be answered as well by payments in gold <lb/>bars as by payments in coins, and the danger of a domestic run <lb/>on the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic, as in 1797, <lb/>will be completely prevented. This is, indeed, at all times, <lb/>the only danger to which it is exposed. A run for coin on <lb/>the Country Banks would instantly fall on the Bank of England, <lb/>and would cramp, if not dry up,the currency throughout the <lb/>empire, producing the greatest confusion. Now, if the Op<lb break="no"/>position Journals be correct, the currency will be placed in <lb/>perfect security, at perfect ease. Nothing will be able to dis<lb break="no"/>order it. If persons will hoard specie, they must purchase <lb/>gold bars or foreign coin, or content themselves with silver.</p>
                <p>In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the <lb/>amount of L.800,000 each year, and then the value of gold <lb/>was rather below the standard price. In the year 1817 we <lb/>imported to the amount of six millions, and in the year 1818 <lb/>we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. Du<lb break="no"/>ring the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have <lb/>an abundant harvest or two, and little importation of corn <lb/>become necessary, gold will again fall very low. The Bank <lb/>will then be able to pay, to buy gold to the full extent of Mr <lb/>Ricardo's plan, and to place their notes on a firm, unques<lb break="no"/>tionable foundation. The finances of the continent, and of <lb/>the world, indeed–the sources and circulation of money will, <lb/>during peace, gradually become steadier and better known. <lb/>The East Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quan<lb break="no"/>tity of specie, while Spanish America, in consequence of her <lb/>troubles, yields far less than usual. It would be madness to <lb/>fly in the face of all these circumstances, by compelling the <lb/>Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may be desirable to li<lb break="no"/>mit the issue of bank notes to some certain, yet liberal amount. <lb/>We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the Committee ; <lb/>but, if some rumours be true, we augur favourably of it. It[?] <lb/>is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee, and stood alone in <lb/>voting against the Report. Thus, then, the Report cannot be <lb/>in favour of a very sudden or decided plan for the resumpion <lb/>of cash payments, or Mr Tierney would not have voted against <lb/>it ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable prospect of a rational <lb/>scheme for that resumption, or the other five or six Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion Members of the Committee would not have voted for it. <lb/>– <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Grand Pigeon Match</hi>, three Gentlemen of the Midgham <lb/>Club, against thrice of All England, took place on Monday on <lb/>Farnham Downs, at twenty-one birds, twenty-one yards dis<lb break="no"/>tance from the gun, for 150 guineas aside, charge unlimited. <lb/>Messrs Adams, Russel and Holt, were selected from the Crack <lb/>Club against Messrs King, Short and Keans. The sports were <lb/>as follows ; Mr Adams killed nineteen birds, and the remain<lb break="no"/>ing two were severely hit. Russel killed eighteen, but lost <lb/>one three yards out of bounds, and Mr Holt bagged sixteen, <lb/>making a grand total of fifty-two from sixty-three. The Club <lb/>was at first backed to win, but the England shots were now <lb/>backed freely at six to four, as they were considered safe <lb/><hi rend="italic">eighteen</hi>  bird men. Mr King killed twenty, but lost two out <lb/>of bounds. Short missed his first three, which brought bet<lb break="no"/>ting to two to one onn the Club, but he killed the next seven<lb break="no"/>teen, and missed the last bird. Mr Keans had seventeen to <lb/>tie, and eighteen to win, and he was back at five to four <lb/>and at two to one, after killing eleven birds in succession. <lb/>He, however, missed the seventeenth, and had to kill the o<lb break="no"/>ther four to win. He succeeded, and the prize was won by once <lb/>bird. It was altogether the most interesting match of this <lb/>sort known for years.</p>
                <p>Letters from Petersburgh, of the 15th ultimo, mention that <lb/>Prince Gustavus of Sweden, son of King Gustavus IV., has <lb/>obtained permission from the Emperor, his uncle, to proceed <lb/>to England, for the purpose of completing his studies at Ox<lb break="no"/>ford. Reports speak highly of the virtues and talents of this <lb/>unfortunate young Prince, who excites universal interest and <lb/>sympathy in the north of Europe. In these feelings we must <lb/>largely share, for we cannot easily forget the associations with <lb/>which the name of <hi rend="italic">Vasa</hi>  was connected, not the services ren<lb break="no"/>dered by two Sovereigns of that Illustrious House to the cause <lb/>of civil and religious liberty. It is said that a great Potentate, <lb/>whose generosity and magnanimity are proverbial, has settled <lb/>upon Prince Gustavus an allowance of L. 2,000 Sterling per <lb/>annum, during the residence of the latter in England, and that <lb/>on the return of his Royal Highness to the Continent he is <lb/>to espouse his cousin, a Princess of Hesse Cassel, who, if ru<lb break="no"/>mour be correct, has lately refused a matrimonial alliance <lb/>with the new Swedish dynasty.</p>
                <p>Papers arrivedon Saturday from New York and Boston to <lb/>the 15th ult. The National Intelligencer, in an article occu<lb break="no"/>pying five columns, under the head of "Strictures on Mr La<lb break="no"/>cock's Report on the Seminole War," defends the sanguinary <lb/>proceedings of General Jackson. This production is said to <lb/>have excited a great sensation throughout the United States, <lb/>being supposed to express the sentiments of the Executive. <lb/>The General had left Washington for his residence in Tenes<lb break="no"/>see. By an arrival from Aux Cayes, intelligence was stated <lb/>to be received that Sir G M'Gregor's troops had deserted <lb/>him, owing to the want of funds for their subsistence.</p>
