                <p><hi rend="italic">Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the  <lb/>House of Representatives,</hi></p>
                <p>Lay before Congress the copy of a letter, with its en<lb break="no"/>closure, from the Secretary of State to the Minister <lb/>Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty; it being an <lb/>answer to a letter from the Mnister to him; bearing <lb/>date the 22 ult. and already communicated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="right">GEO. WASHINGTON.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Philadelphia</hi>, <hi rend="italic">June</hi>  2, 1794.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">SIR</hi>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">If</hi>, the letter with which you honoured me on the 22d <lb/>ult. had not entered into a train of recrimination a<lb break="no"/>gainst the United States, I should not now trouble you <lb/>with a return to its unpleasant topics. Among the rea<lb break="no"/>sons, which would have induced me to add nothing to <lb/>my letter the 1st of lat month, its would have been <lb/>of some weight that by silence I should avoid the repeti<lb break="no"/>tion of a style and manner, which seem to have produced <lb/>a personal excitement.</p>
                <p> As you are willing to admit the authenticity of Lord <lb/>Dorcester's speech, we will, with your approbation, re<lb break="no"/>serve for a future discussion, on what occasion, and to <lb/>what degree, an explanation may be required by the go<lb break="no"/>vernment of the United States from a foreign minister.</p>
                <p>I selected only one passage of that speech, because in <lb/>it was concentrated the real object of the whole; which <lb/>was to declare an expectation, that Great Britain would <lb/>be at War with the united States in the course of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent year. and, if she were, to cause the warriors to draw <lb/>a line. this is the undisguised sense of the governor-ge<lb break="no"/>neral, unaffected by the preliminary words, which you <lb/>have thought proper to quote. It is your own interpre<lb break="no"/>tation. For so far are you from contradicting my asser<lb break="no"/>tion, that Lord Dorchester fostered and encouraged in <lb/>the Indians, hostile dispositions towards us, that you con<lb break="no"/>tinue the greater part of your remaining observations to <lb/>vindicate his persuasion and your own, that the principal <lb/>aggression, leading to hostility, proceeded from the United <lb/>States and to suggest many others of the same tendency, <lb/>upon which you would not dilate.</p>
                <p> I shall not shrink, Sir, from your charges.</p>
                <p>1st Notwithstanding the territory, upon which certain <lb/>inhabitants of Vermont are presented in your letter of the 5th of July, 1792, to have trespassed, belong to the <lb/>United States; yet on the 9th of the same month did <lb/>my predecessor give you, as is admitted, positive assur<lb break="no"/>ances of the determination to discourage and repress the <lb/>subject of your complaint. The necessary instructions <lb/>were accordingly forwarded to that state. On examining <lb/>your correspondence with my department, it does not ap<lb break="no"/>pear that from the 9th of July, 1792, to the 10th of <lb/>March, 1794 upwards of nineteen months, our govern<lb break="no"/>ment ever unrdestood from yourself, or any authority of<lb break="no"/>his Britannic Majesty, that the original dissatisfaction con<lb break="no"/>tinued. Nor was any discontent heard from that quar<lb break="no"/>ter through other channels, except what related to out<lb break="no"/>rages upon our own citizens by British subjects. Then, <lb/>indeed, thirty days after the hostile tribes of Indians had <lb/>been assembled by Lord Dorchester, at Quebec, you renew<lb break="no"/>your remonstrance. Although it cannot be by any means <lb/>believed, that this was written, in order to ausher in the intelligence, which soon after arrived on his speech; ye tit <lb/>is difficult to account for so long an interval under the <lb/>circumstances supposed. Nor ought my answer, although <lb/>delayed for fifty days, until the 19th of April, 1794, to be constured into an assent to any charge, since at the end <lb/>of that period, having been disappointed, as my letter shews, in one opportunity of information, and no other <lb/>presenting itself, we were not in a capacity of contradict<lb break="no"/>ing your assertions. However, Sir, the instructions, issued <lb/>in consequence of your application, conveyed positive or<lb break="no"/>ders for the correction of what, upon examination, should <lb/>be found irregular.</p>
                <p>2d, Among the points, to which you intimate that you <lb/>might have adverted, is enumerated the fitting out of two <lb/>privateers at Charleston, South Carolina. Whatever this <lb/>transaction might have been, it probably occurred at the <lb/>commencement of the war, and before the existence of <lb/>the war was communicated to our government, by any of <lb/>the powers engaged. Had such a transaction been known <lb/>to the President in time, you can well judge from his <lb/>actual conduct, what he would then have done. His pro<cb break="no"/>clamation on the 2nd of April, 1793, his call upon the <lb/>state governors on the 26th of the same months, to co-ope<lb break="no"/>rate with him in the work of impartiality and peace; the <lb/>system of rules which he established, and which were im<lb break="no"/>parted to you, are unerring indications of the spirit of <lb/>those measures, on which he had determined. He sup<lb break="no"/>pressed the consular courts, which attempted to pass sen<lb break="no"/>tences of condemnation on captures; he restored several <lb/>vessels to British owners; prosecutions have been institut<lb break="no"/>ed against the violaters of neutrality. In a word, Sir, <lb/>what has been required, under the sanction of the law of <lb/>nations, which had not been fulfilled? How many things<lb break="no"/>have been spontaneously done, to evince our impartiality? Let me request you to review my predecessor’s letters to you of April 22, May 15, June 5, August 7, 8, 25, Sep<lb break="no"/>tember 5 and 12, 1793: and to say if more could be well <lb/>expected from us? After such demonstrations, it might <lb/>have been hoped, that the equipment of these two priva<lb break="no"/>teers would not rise again in the shape of a charge. But <lb/>the letter of the 5th of June being conceived of itself to be <lb/>satisfactory, is here inserted.</p>
                <p>"In the letter which I had the honour of writing you <lb/>on the 15th of May, in answer to your several memorials <lb/>of the 8th of that month, I mentioned that the President, <lb/>reserved for further consideration, a part of the one which <lb/>related to the equioment of two privateers in the port of <lb/>Charleston. The part alluded to was that wherein you <lb/>express your confidence that the executive government of <lb/>the United States would pursue measures for represeeing <lb/>such practices in the future, and for restoring to their rightful <lb/>owners any captures which such privateers might be bring <lb/>into the ports of the United States."</p>
                <p>"The President,after a full investigation of this subject, <lb/>and the most mature consideration, has charged me to <lb/>communicate to you, that the first part of this application <lb/>is found to be jest, and that effectual measures are taken <lb/>for preventing repetitions of the act therin complained of; but that the latter part, desiring restitution of the prizes, <lb/>is understood to be inconsistent with the rules which go<lb break="no"/>vern such cafes, and would therefore be unjustifiable to<lb break="no"/>wards the other party</p>
                <p>"The principal agents in this transaction were French <lb/>citizens. Being within the United States, at the moment <lb/>a war broke out between their own and another country, <lb/>they determine to go in its defence; they purchase, arm, <lb/>and equip a vessel, with their own money, man it them<lb break="no"/>selves, receive a regular commission from their nation, de<lb break="no"/>part out of the United states, and then commence hosti<lb break="no"/>lities by capturing a vessel If, under these circumstance,<lb break="no"/>the commission of the captors was valid, the property, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the laws of war, was, by the capture, transfer<lb break="no"/>red to them; and it would be an aggression on their na<lb break="no"/>tion, for the United states to rescue it from them, whether <lb/>on the high seas, or on coming into their ports. If the <lb/>commission was not valid and consequently, the property <lb/>not transferred by the laws of war, to the capture, then <lb/>the case would have been cognizable in our courts of ad<lb break="no"/>miralty, and the owners might have gone thither for re<lb break="no"/>dress. So that on neither supposition, would the execu<lb break="no"/>tive be justifiable in interposing.</p>
                <p>With respect to the United States, the transaction can <lb/>in no wise be imputed to them. It was in the first mo<lb break="no"/>ment of the war,ߝin one of the their most distant port.ߝbefore measures could be provided by the government to <lb/>meet all the cases, which such a state of things was to produce, impossible to have known, and therefore <lb/>impossible to have been prevented by that government.</p>
                <p>"The moment it was known, the most energetic or<lb break="no"/>ders were sent to every state and port in the union to pre<lb break="no"/>vent a repetition of the accident. On a suggestion, that <lb/>citizens of the United States had taken part in the act, one <lb/>who was designated, was instantly committed to prison, <lb/>for prosecution; one or two others have been since named, <lb/>and committed in like manner; and should it appear, that <lb/>there were still others, no measures would be spared to <lb/>bring them to justice. The President had even gone far<lb break="no"/>ther; He has required, as a reparation of their breach of <lb/>respect to the United States, that the vessels so armed and <lb/>equipped, shall depart from our ports.</p>
                <p>"You will see, Sir, in these proceedings of the Presi<lb break="no"/>dent, unequivocal proofs of the line of strict right, which <lb/>he means to pursue. The measures now mentioned, are <lb/>taken in justice to the one part; the ulterior measure of <lb/>seizing and restoring the prizes, is declined in justice to <lb/>the other; and the evil, thus early arrested, will be of <lb/>very limited effects; perhaps, indeed, soon disappear altogether."</p>
                <p> As to the permission from the governor of South Caro<lb break="no"/>lina, <supplied reason="copy blur">??? ??? departures of ??? privateers ??? ???,</supplied> you <cb/> may assure yourself of a proper inquiry; and I take the <lb/>liberty of requesting any evidence which you may have <lb/>of it</p>
                <p> 3. With so many direct proofs in your hands, of the <lb/>opinion constantly maintained by our government against <lb/>the legality of captures in general made by illegal priva<lb break="no"/>teers, it is not easily explained, why the validity of those <lb/>before the 5th of June, 1793, should be argued, from a <lb/>refusal to restore them. The above received letter of that <lb/>date, neither a<supplied reason="copy blur">ffi</supplied>rms nor disa<supplied reason="copy blur">ffirms</supplied> their validity; but de<lb break="no"/>clines the granting of restitutions being inconsistent with <lb/>the rules which govern such cases. Those ruled are <lb/>That if the commission be good, the capture is good; if <lb/>the commission be bad, the capture is bad; but whether <lb/>it be good or bad, is not decided; it being enough to <lb/>prove, that the transaction, for the reasons assigned, can in <lb/>no wise be imputed to the united States. But if captures <lb/>of this kind, prior to the 5th of June, 1792, do really a<lb break="no"/>mount (as is conceived by some) to no very considerable <lb/>value, this would of itself, lessen the importance of the in<lb break="no"/>sinuation.</p>
                <p>4th. The secretary of war has undertaken to ascertain <lb/>the precise state of the privateers le Petit Democrate and <lb/>la Carmagnole, and the result will be communicated to you. <lb/>In the mean time, it is a matter of some surprise, that <lb/>vessels, whose single employment and profit, must consist <lb/>in cruizing on the ocean, should have remained in the port <lb/>of New-York during the whole winter, and probably up <lb/>to the date of your letter (May 22d, 1794) May it not <lb/>be presumed, that their activity has been checked by the <lb/>intervention of the government? But, sir, if they have <lb/>not been dismantled, your letter brings the first notice of <lb/>the omission.</p>
                <p> 5th. It is true, that the sale of prizes made by French <lb/>cruizers, has not been prohibited in the United States, and <lb/>that our treaty with France has been so interpreted, as not <lb/>to contemplate a freedom to sell. The next resort was to <lb/>the law of nations; which was scrupulously searched by the <lb/>executive, with the pure desire of discovering truth and <lb/>justice to all. Upon this, as on many other occasions, the <lb/>civilians differ; Vattel declaring, That a privateer may car<lb break="no"/>ry his prize into a neutral port, and there freely sell it; <lb/>Martens affirming the same doctrine, if it has not been o<lb break="no"/>therwise regulated by treaty; and others opposing it. in <lb/>this sxhism among the writers,it was resolved by the Pre<lb break="no"/>sident of the United States, to impose no restraint upon <lb/>those sales; and to refer them; as affairs of legislation, to congress, at the earliest moment of their session. Thus <lb/>much has been observed, not as my final anser, but mere<lb break="no"/>ly to introduce an assurance, that I will follow you in the <lb/>main discussion, whensoever you shall bring it forward in <lb/>detail.</p>
                <p>6th. Undoubtedly, sir, you have been misinformed, that <lb/>the vessels of France have been permitted to depart from <lb/>our ports, notwithstanding the embargo. As the history <lb/>of the executive proceedings is neither long, nor entangled, <lb/>it shall be frankly stated to you. As soon as the embar<lb break="no"/>go was laid, expresses and advice boats were dispatched, to <lb/>notify the officer of the customs and revenue cutters, and <lb/>all others concerned in its execution. The resolution im<lb break="no"/>posing it, involved all foreign nations; the instructions <lb/>from the United States, favoured no nation, directly or in<lb break="no"/>directly. A French snow, La Camille, which had descend<lb break="no"/>ed the river Delaware as low as New-Castle on her voy<lb break="no"/>age, was stopped by an officer of the United States; and <lb/>the President, adhering to perfect impartiality could not <lb/>think himself justified, to gratify the Minister of the French Republic with a passport. Passports being kept under the <lb/>special view of the President were issued only after his ex<lb break="no"/>aminatino of each case, and the total number of them does <lb/>not exceed twenty-six. Among them, was one to your<lb break="no"/>self; one to an agent who was sent to the West-Indies, <lb/>upon a business connected with the late captures and con<lb break="no"/>demnation in various British courts of admiralty; one to a <lb/>citizen whose vessel was under trial in Bermuda, and who <lb/>was anxious to forward the British instructions of the 8th <lb/>January, 1794, with a hope of rescuing her from confis<lb break="no"/>cation; one to the friends of Joshua Barney then in Jami<lb break="no"/>ca; twenty for the accomodation of several unfortunate in<lb break="no"/>habitants of St. Domingo, to some of whome our govern<lb break="no"/>ment was advancing money for their support, and who could <lb/>no longer endure their separation from home; one to some <lb/>other persons in peculiar circumstances, desirous of return<lb break="no"/>ing to the West-Indies; and in the last instance, one to the <lb/>Minister of the French Republic. If, therefore, by any o<lb break="no"/>ther passport, or permission; the embargo has been relaxed, <lb/>it was unauthorized by the President, and unlawful. The <lb/>distance of Hampton Road from this city, being more than <lb/>three hundred miles, the officers of government, resident <pb n="2"/> here, could not learn, at the moment, what was passing <lb/>there. No intelligence of an official nature of any real im<lb break="no"/>portance. No complaint from any other foreign minister, <lb/>or any othe rpseron, has since reached us. If, Sir, you <lb/>should happen to possess the information, I ask it as a favour, of you, to designate, who granted the permission, and <lb/>under what circumstances the French vessels left that <lb/>road? An investigation, however, has been, and shall be <lb/>pursued, on our part, without delay. If the law has been <lb/>violated, it shall be vindicated; but a violation of law, is <lb/>very remote from a permission of the government.</p>
                <p> 7th. The uniformly unfriendly treatment which the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish officers are said to have experienced in the United <lb/>States, cannot be answered, until it shall be more explicitly <lb/>defined. Did this treatment break forth in words or ac<lb break="no"/>tions, not cognizable by law? If so, no complaint can be <lb/>offered to government. Or in words or action, which <lb/>were so cognizable? Our courts are free to foreigners a<lb break="no"/>gainst citizens, and independent of influence. To yourself <lb/>let me appeal, that on the representations, which you thought <lb/>proper to lay before the President, in relation to the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish consul at Baltimore, the British consul at Norfolk, and <lb/>the commander of the DȰdalus frigate, the necessary mea<lb break="no"/>sures were promptly adopted; the result has been trans<lb break="no"/>mitted to you, and no objection has been returned. Nor <lb/>was the government backward in its interference in the <lb/>late affair of Philadelphia. And these eing the only oc<lb break="no"/>currences of the kind within my knowledge, i trust, that <lb/>no example can be produced of government refusing to ex<lb break="no"/>tend its protection on every seasonable occasion.</p>
                <p>8th. The events at Newport, in Rhode-Island are ac<lb break="no"/>curately detailed in the proceedings, which I have the ho<lb break="no"/>nour of enclosing to you. Within the limits of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent letter, I cannot do more; as it might be an useless talk <lb/>to detain you with remarks, when non of them might be <lb/>adapted to the animadversions which you mediate. It is <lb/>enough, therefore, for me to engage, that these animadver<lb break="no"/>sions, whenever they shall appear, shall receive particular <lb/>attention.</p>
                <p>Although, Sir, your charges against the United States <lb/>are sketched only; the impression, which may have been <lb/>intended, cannot be counteracted too soon, by such general <lb/>elucidations, as at a future day may be more minutely un<lb break="no"/>folded. But let these facts be as they will; are they indi<lb break="no"/>cative of a hostile disposition in the United States, and <lb/>ought they ultimately to produce a state of war? This is <lb/>not the place for us to retort our complaints. But com<lb break="no"/>pare them with the whole of your catalogue; and say, what <lb/>may our feeling be? Yet we prefer peace.</p>
                <p>9th. As Lord Dorchester's endeavour to stir up the In<lb break="no"/>dians against us, is without justification; so is the expedi<lb break="no"/>tion of Governor Simcoe without pretext.</p>
                <p>That you have received no intelligence of such an event <lb/>having actually occurred, leaves room to conjecture, that <lb/>you may not be without intelligence of it having been de<lb break="no"/>signed; and that it has therefore probably taken place. <lb/>But you insist that much will depend on the place intend<lb break="no"/>ed for the fort. Let the point allotted for it on the Mia<lb break="no"/>mi, be unknown; the place is for our immediate purpose <lb/>adequatley market out by eing on the river. A single <lb/>glance of the eye over the map, proves that its source is <lb/>within the limits of the United States. In its whole length <lb/>it is flanked on each side by our territory. Its very mouth <lb/>is to the Southward of our line, as recognised by our trea<lb break="no"/>ty with his Britannic Majesty. On no part therefore of <lb/>the rapids can a fort be built, but within out country.</p>
                <p>This being fixed, your argument is, that if the fort be <lb/>for the purpose of protecting subjects of his majesty, resid<lb break="no"/>ing in districts, dependent on the fort of Detroit, or of pre<lb break="no"/>venting that fortress from being straitened by the approach <lb/>of the American army; the principle of <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>, until the final arrangement of the point in discussion between the <lb/>two countries shall be concluded, will strictly apply.</p>
                <p>To change by hostile movements the condition of a thing, <lb/>concerning which a treaty is opened, not being consonant <lb/>with the spirit of adjustment, the principle of <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>  has <lb/>been generally adopted. The nearest point of the rapids <lb/>to Detroit cannot be less than fifty miles. They have <lb/>never been considered, they never could be considered, as <lb/>appending to Detroit. But you proceed and say, tha tthe <lb/>proposed assumption of territory may depend on districts, <lb/>which depend on Detroit. It is too obvious to dwell up<lb break="no"/>on the remark, that if Detroit which lies within the Unit<lb break="no"/>ed States, becomes the first station from which a district may be generated, one encroachment may beget another <lb/><hi rend="italic">ad  <lb/>infinitum</hi>. It will, however, be very acceptable to un<lb break="no"/>derstand with accuracy, how much of our territory towards <lb/>the Miami was actually possessed by the military establish<lb break="no"/>ment of Detroit at the time of peace. I mention the mi<lb break="no"/>litary establishment; because if any subjects of his Britain<lb break="no"/>nic majesty reside beyond the line of actual possess, they <lb/>are, as being within our limits, under our jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>To prevent the fortress of Detroit from being straitened <lb/>by the approach of the American army, is either a new <lb/>modification of the preceding idea, or founded upon a un<lb break="no"/>tenable suspicion. For the question must recur, are the <lb/>rapids an appendage to Detroit? Were they connected <lb/>with it at the peace? If convenience only were to be con<lb break="no"/>sulted, and a wide range of unsettled territory, by being <lb/>suitable to the momentary circumstances of one nation, is <lb/>to be transferred for that reason alone from another, <cb/> which is the true proprietor, we might even then contro<lb break="no"/>vert the conveniency of the rapids to Detroit. If right be <lb/>consulted, our right is complete. Is then our territory to <lb/>be thus seized? Nay, more sir, I am authorized to say to <lb/>you explicitly, that the American army has no instruc<lb break="no"/>tions to straiten or annoy that post; and that if the descent on the rapids was dictated by this consideration, it ought <lb/>to be discontinued without cause.</p>
