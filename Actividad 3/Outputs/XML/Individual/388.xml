                <p><pb n="6"/>"From some late communications it is evident, <lb/>that as much sugar may be made on the new lands <lb/>in the States of New-York and Pennsylvania as <lb/>will supply the whole United States, and perhaps <lb/>in a little time furnish an article of exportation. <lb/>The profits of the manufactory of sugar, when <lb/>made by private families, will be greater than <lb/>when made by large works. A boiler, which will <lb/>cost only 16s. will be the whole expence that will <lb/>be necessary to carry on this business, and the <lb/>sugar may be made at a season of the year when <lb/>no work can be done upon a farm. The price of <lb/>it, when sent to Philadelphia, will be twice as high <lb/>as the same quantity of wheat.  The sugar trees <lb/>may be made to yield their juice without being <lb/>injured, and when they decay, fresh ones may easily <lb/>be cultivated in the soil upon which they now <lb/>grow. When we consider the value of sugar, its <lb/>general and wholesome use in diet, and above all, <lb/>that it has hitherto been obtained at the price of <lb/>the lives and liberty of our African brethren, we <lb/>cannot help congratulating our fellow citizens <lb/>upon the prospect of manufactories of that article <lb/>being established among us, whereby immense sums <lb/>of money will be saved to our country, and, what <lb/>is more, our country freed from the guilt of en<lb break="no"/>couraging the detestable traffic in human crea<lb break="no"/>tures.</p>
                <p>"Several hundred sugar-kettles, we hear, are <lb/>now making in New Jersey, for the use of the <lb/>the New England settlers of the Susquehannahand Delaware."</p>
