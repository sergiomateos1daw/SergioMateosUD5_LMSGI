                <p><pb/><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Account of a singular Sect called </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Shaking Quak<lb break="no"/>ERS  </hi><hi rend="italic">in </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">America</hi>.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="enlarged-capital">I</hi> N the United States of America there are some <lb/>Jews, and various denomications of Christians, <lb/>–as Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, <lb/>Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers, Dunkers, <lb/>Moravians, Deists, Methodists, Newlights, San<lb break="no"/>dimanians, Universalists, and Shaking Quakers; <lb/>all of whom are allowed to perform religious wor<lb break="no"/>ship accoridng to the dictates of their consciences.</p>
                <p>The Shaking Quakers are a new sects, that <lb/>sprang up about the year 1769 : an old woman <lb/>called the Elect Lady, with twelve disciples, all <lb/>of which were said to be Europeans, were the <lb/>founders of this new mode of worship ; they drew <lb/>thousands of people after them, who pretended <lb/>they were visited with power from on high to <lb/>work miracles, heal the sick, raise the dead, cast <lb/>out devils, and speak in unknown languages.</p>
                <p>This Lady risided in the north-westerly part <lb/>of the State of New York, where she began to <lb/>instil her tenets into some of the people there:– <lb/>afterwards she rambled from place to place, pro<lb break="no"/>mulgating her religion, and gaining proselytes in <lb/>New England, and elsewhere:–she engrossed the <lb/>kingdom of heaven to herself and followers, to <lb/>the seculsion of all others.</p>
                <p>She pretended her mission was immediately from <lb/>heaven;–that she travelled in pain for her elect, <lb/>–could speak in seventry-two unknown languages, <lb/>in which she conversed with those that had de<lb break="no"/>parted this life,–that there had not been a true <lb/>church upon earth since the days of the Apostles, <lb/>until her's was erected,–that both the living and <lb/>the dead must be saved, in, by, and through her <lb/>–must confess their sins unto her, and procure <lb/>her parson, or they could not be saved;–that <lb/>that she gathered her church from both earth and <lb/>hell, as every person that had died since the time <lb/>of the Apostles, until her church was set up, was <lb/>damned, and that they were ocntinually making <lb/>intercession to her for salvation, which was the <lb/>occasion of her talking to them in those unknown <lb/>tongues.</p>
                <p>Those that entered into her church were ob<lb break="no"/>liged to confess their sins, and deliver up their <lb/>jewels, rings, necklaces, buckles, watches, &amp;c. to <lb/>be disposed of as she thought fit.</p>
                <p>It has been reported that some of these confes<lb break="no"/>sions proved very beneficial; for some of her <lb/>church members owned they had stolen things that <lb/>had been laid to innocent persons.</p>
                <p>When these people carry on their worship, they <lb/>pretend to praise the Lord by singing, dancing, <lb/>jumping, turning round, falling down, tumbling, <lb/>&amp;c. and in the mean time some will be trembling, <lb/>groaning, sighing, and sobbing: whilst others are <lb/>preaching, praying, exhorting, &amp;c. others will be <lb/>clapping their hands, shouting, hallowing, scream<lb break="no"/>ing, and making such a hideous noise, that it <lb/>may be heard at a great distance, and will often <lb/>affrighten the spectators.</p>
                <p>They often dance three hours without inter<lb break="no"/>mission, and when any of them are tired of prais<lb break="no"/>ing the Lord that way, they are whipped by o<lb break="no"/>thers, to make the worship go on briskly. <cb/>They dance till they are much emaciated ; the <lb/>young women grow pale, appear like ghosts or <lb/>apparitions, or like deserters from a church-yard, <lb/>–if I may use the sailor's phrase.</p>
                <p>They make no use of the Eucharist, or of wa<lb break="no"/>ter baptism in their churchs; are averse to wars, <lb/>fighting, and swearing ; they use the plain lan<lb break="no"/>guage, and cry– <hi rend="italic">yea</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">nay</hi>, instead of <hi rend="italic">yes</hi>  and <lb/><hi rend="italic">no</hi> : but the other Quakers do not approve of all <lb/>their tenets.</p>
                <p>At particular times they labour very hard at <lb/>their respective occupations, and are very careful <lb/>that no time is spent in idleness.</p>
                <p>They pretend they hold a correspondence with <lb/>the saints and angels, and that they frequently <lb/>see and converse with the spirits of their departed <lb/>friends.</p>
                <p>Many of them refuse to be with their wives, <lb/>because they suppose they are part of the hundred <lb/>and forty and four thousand mentioned in the <lb/>Revelations that were redeemed from the earth, <lb/>and were not defiled with women.</p>
                <p>They hold, that they have already been made <lb/>partakers of the first resurrection, and that on <lb/>them the second death will have no power.</p>
                <p>They do not allows the instrumental music in <lb/>their churches, because they suppose it was cere<lb break="no"/>monial, and is abolished;–but pretend that they <lb/>carry on their worship by the immediate power <lb/>and influence of the Holy Ghost, and that they <lb/>have scripture warrents for their practice, a[?]– <lb/>Sing unto God,–Praise the Lord in the dance; <lb/>–O clap your hands, all ye people;–Shout on <lb/>to God;–Make a joyful noise;–Fall down be<lb break="no"/>fore the Lords,&amp;c.</p>
