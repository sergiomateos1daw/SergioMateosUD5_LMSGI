                <p>Quebec, Sept. 10. <lb/>The Americans, to the number of 900 men, landed and at<lb break="no"/> <lb/>tacked Fort Michillimackinac, in Lake Huron, on the 4th <lb/>August. They were repulsed by the British garrison.</p>
                <p>The American fort la Prairie du Chiens has been taken <lb/>by the British. This place was considered as of great impor<lb break="no"/>tance to the enemy.</p>
                <p>Major General Conran, of the Royal, has had the misfor<lb break="no"/>tune to break his leg, by a fall from his horse. This officer <lb/>had just arrived to join the army on the Niagara frontier, <lb/>when he met with this accident.</p>
                <p>On the 31st August, the British troops broke their en<lb break="no"/>campment at Odell Town, near Lake Champlain, and pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded immediately to take possession of the position which <lb/>the American army had just abandoned at the village of <lb/>Champlain. This army was commanded by General Izard, <lb/>and are said to have proceeded partly to Plattsburgh, and part<lb break="no"/>ly to Sackett's Harbour, on Lake Ontario. The British <lb/>troops now at Champlain are commanded by Major Gene<lb break="no"/> <lb/>rals Brisbane, Power, and Robinson, and consist of the <lb/>13th, 49, 88th, Meuron's regiment, Canadian chasseurs, <lb/>&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The 79th[?] or [?] Glasgow Lowland regiment are now quarter<lb break="no"/>ed at Cornwall, in Upper Canada.</p>
                <p>The 4th[?] battalion of the 1st, or Royal Scots, are station<lb break="no"/>ed at Quebec.</p>
                <p>The 3rd[?], 104th flank[?] companies, 103d, 8th, or King's, <lb/>100th, regiment de Watteville, [?] battalion of 1st, or <lb/>Royal Scots, and 41st flank[?] companies are with the army <lb/>under Lieutenant General Drummon, on the Niagara fron<lb break="no"/>tier, Upper Canada.</p>
                <p>The 37th and 57th regiments are at Montreal.</p>
                <p>On the 15th of August, the British troops under Lieute<lb break="no"/>nant General Drummond assaulted Fort Erie. The attack <lb/>was made in three columns, under Colonel Scott of the 103d <lb/>regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Drummond 104th regiment, and <lb/>Lieutenant Colonel Fischer of de Watteville's. The two <lb/>former were directed to scale the fort, and the latter to get <lb/>possession of a small hill, named Snake-Hill, which the Ame<lb break="no"/>ricans had fortified, and being situated only about eight hun<lb break="no"/>dred yards from Fort Erie, was of consequence to us. This <lb/>latter column failed in their object ; but the two columns des<lb break="no"/>tined for the fort carried the same in a most gallant manner, <lb/>and obliged the enemy to retire into two stone block-houses <lb/>inside the fort, when their own guns were turned against <lb/>them. At this time a most unfortunate explosion took place, <lb/>which blew up the magazine and battery, and with them a <lb/>number of our brave soldiers ; and the consternation caused <lb/>by this was so great, and we were obliged to abandon our <lb/>conquest, and retreat to our original position, with great loss <lb/>of both officers and men.</p>
                <p>The large ship-building by the British at Kingston, on Lake <lb/>Ontario is to be launched the second week in September– <lb/>also will carry about 100 guns.</p>
                <p>The battalion of royal marines, commanded by Lieutenant<lb break="no"/>Colonel Williams, and which has been stationed lately at Isle <lb/>au Noix, and parts adjacent, have been broken up and distri<lb break="no"/>buted among the fleets on the Lakes. The Staff of the batta<lb break="no"/>lion proceed immediately to Halifax from Quebec, in the Cey<lb break="no"/>long armed-en [?] ship.</p>
                <p>The Junon frigate, Captain Upton, has arrived from Hali<lb break="no"/>fax at Quebec, with money for Government. The crew of <lb/>this vessel is to be employed on the Lakes.</p>
                <p>A brig, which sailed from Cork, under convoy of the An<lb break="no"/>telope, of 50 guns, has arrived at Quebec.–The Antelope, <lb/>and the ships under convoy, are hourly expected. It is <lb/>said that there are on board the ships of the latter about <lb/>4000 troops, chiefly detachments and reinforcements for the <lb/>regimentsin Canada.</p>
                <p>Captain Dowale, of the royal navy, now commands the <lb/>fleet on Lake Champlain.</p>
