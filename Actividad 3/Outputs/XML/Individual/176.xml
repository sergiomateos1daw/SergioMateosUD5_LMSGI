                <p>Sierra Leone Gazettes to the 16th of December have <lb/>been received. It is satisafactory to learn that some <lb/>more effectual measures, than any before adopted by <lb/>the French Government, to prevent slave trading are <lb/>now in a course of execution. The French brig of <lb/>war, Le Huron, of 22 guns, Commodore Du Pres<lb break="no"/>sit, is employed in cruizing for that purpose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Earthquake at Zante</hi>, Jan. 8.–The last week <lb/>has been a scene of horror and destruction at Zante.– <lb/>At four o'clock, on the morning of the 29th of Dec. <lb/>we had a violent shock of an earthquake, which lasted <lb/>nearly half a minute ; this was followed by eight other <lb/>shocks, between four and six o'clock, which threw <lb/>down one thousand three hundred houses. Providen<lb break="no"/>tially, the first shock did not throw down many, so <lb/>that the inhabitants had time to escape before succeed<lb break="no"/>ing shocks, otherwise theloss would have been dread<lb break="no"/>ful. Only ten lives have been lost, but not a house <lb/>in the town has escaped without some injury. The <lb/>town is still in a complete state of confusion ; one <lb/>thousand give hundred houses more, being so much in<lb break="no"/>jured as to be marked in order to be pulled down ; all <lb/>the steeples in the place must be taken down. The <lb/>streets are almost impassable from the fallen houses ; <lb/>and great caution is required, in walking, to avoid the <lb/>ruins that are still falling.</p>
