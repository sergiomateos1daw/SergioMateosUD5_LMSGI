                <p>We arrived safe at this place<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> beginning of <lb/>April from Pittsburgh, and a<supplied reason="copy folded">dre</supplied>adful passage <lb/>we had of it. The waters of<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> river Ohio, <lb/>which had risen rapidly since M<supplied reason="copy folded">arc</supplied>h, now pour<lb break="no"/>ed down in a perfect torrent;<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> we were in as <lb/>much danger of foundering at<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> rapids, as we <lb/>would have been in the middle<supplied reason="copy folded">t</supplied>he Atlantic in <lb/>a severe gale. We were frequen<supplied reason="copy folded">tl</supplied>y too, in the <lb/>most imminent danger of our li<supplied reason="copy folded">fe</supplied> from the limbs <lb/>of trees hanging just above the<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied>; and through <lb/>which we were often hurried<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> rate of seven <lb/>miles an hour, but the impetuo<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> of the stream. <lb/>If any of the canoes had been tangled among <lb/>these branches (which in many<supplied reason="copy folded">pl</supplied>aces hang very <lb/>thick over the river), they<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> inevitably have <lb/>been overturned, and<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied><supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> buried in the <lb/><supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> of the Ohio; fortunately<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> accident <lb/>happened to us.</p>
                <p>Our apprehensions of drowning were equalled <lb/>by those of an attack from the<supplied reason="copy folded">In</supplied>dians, who in<lb break="no"/>fest the river, and who inhabit<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> banks: Some <lb/>time ago they killed a Mr. W<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> Browne, and a <lb/>Mr. Allison, who were return<supplied reason="copy folded">ing</supplied> to Lexington <lb/>from Miami. The barbaritie<supplied reason="copy folded">s th</supplied>ey commit are <lb/>wanton and inhuman to the l<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> degree. On the <lb/>3d ult. they attacked a boat<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> few miles from <lb/>Limestone, and killed three<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied>sons, two men <lb/>and a woman; a few days af<supplied reason="copy folded">ter</supplied> this they killed <lb/>two men on Licking river, a<supplied reason="copy folded">nd</supplied> took a boy pri<lb break="no"/>soner, and on their return at<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied>ed a boat below <lb/>the Scioto, as it came to sh<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> and killed four <lb/>men, and took one man and t<supplied reason="copy folded">wo</supplied> women prisoners. <lb/>About three weeks ago they<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied>ed on a boat and <lb/>a canoe, above the Scioto,<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> both sides of the <lb/>river at the same time, by<supplied reason="copy folded">wh</supplied>ich means they <lb/>killed two men; and in sho<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> to such a degree <lb/>have they carried these inh<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> practices, that <lb/>it is dangerous to stir from<supplied reason="copy folded">ho</supplied>me, but in large <lb/>parties, and properly prepar<supplied reason="copy folded">???</supplied> to receive them.</p>
