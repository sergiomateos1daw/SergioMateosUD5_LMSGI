                <p><pb n="5"/> The Indian Chiefs lately arrived in town are six <lb/>in number. They have been indiscriminately styl<lb break="no"/>ed Cherokees, but three of them only are of that <lb/>nation, and three are Creek Indians.â€“They are <lb/>all handsome men, not exceeding in age twenty - <lb/>five or twenty-six. These six Chiefs have 20,000 <lb/>warriors ready to take the field, and have the <lb/>strongest wish to act in conjunction with the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish. They travelled 3000 miles before the reach<lb break="no"/>ed Halifax, and were near 12 months in perform<lb break="no"/>ing the journey. From Halifax they went in an <lb/>English frigate to Quebec to Lord Dorchester, <lb/>by whom they were sent over to England to con<lb break="no"/>cert their plans in person with the Ministry.</p>
                <p>The object of their coming to this country may <lb/>be easily guessed at. They long to make an at<lb break="no"/>tack upon the Spanish settlements. One of them <lb/>was heard last night in the playhouse to say, he <lb/>hoped in six months from this time to be in the <lb/>heart of Mexico.</p>
