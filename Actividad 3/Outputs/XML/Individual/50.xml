                <p><pb/>The following philosophical facts lead us to <lb/>presume that the winter now setting in, will prove <lb/>a mild one : It has been constantly remarked, that <lb/>when this season commences early, and with se<lb break="no"/>verity, in Newfoundland, and the more northern <lb/>part of North America, it becomes extremely ri<lb break="no"/>gorous, and of a proportionate continuance there. <lb/>When, in the above climate, the winters have <lb/>been severe, they have invariably been mild with <lb/>us, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>. Now, the ships which sailed <lb/>from Newfoundland the beginning of October <lb/><hi rend="italic">last</hi>, saw the hills already covered with snow. <lb/>There is still another argument in favour of a mild <lb/>winter with us. Previously to the setting in of a <lb/>severe one, nature, in her bounty, has been always <lb/>observed to have provided an uncommon store of <lb/>wild briar fruits, as a nourishment to the smaller <lb/>birds, who would otherwise perish, a vast carpet <lb/>of snow spreading itself over the ground, so as to <lb/>prevent their coming at the worms, &amp;c. on which <lb/>they are accustomed to feed. The present sea<lb break="no"/>son, the store of these wild fruits is extremely mo<lb break="no"/>derate.</p>
