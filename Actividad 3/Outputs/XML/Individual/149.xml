                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Intended Colony at the Cape of  <lb/>Good Hope.</hi></p>
                <p>The following letter explains, in detail, the degree <lb/>of co-operation which Government proposes to afford to <lb/>those persons who may wish to emigrate from this <lb/>country.</p>
                <p>( <hi rend="smallcaps">Official Circular</hi>.)</p>
                <p>"Downing-street. London, 1819. <lb/>"The sufferings to which many individuals have <lb/>been exposed, who have emigrated to his Majesty's <lb/>foreign possessions, unconnected, and unprovided with <lb/>any capital, or even the means of support, having been <lb/>very afflicting to themselves, and equally burdensome <lb/>to the colonies to which they have proceeded, the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment have determined to confine the application <lb/>of the money recently voted by Address in the House <lb/>of Commons, to those persons who, possessing the <lb/>means, will engage to carry out, at the least, ten able<lb break="no"/>bodied individuals above 18 years of age, with or with<lb break="no"/>out families, the Government always reserving to it<lb break="no"/>self the right of selecting, from the several offers made <lb/>to them, those which may prove, upon examination, to <lb/>be most eligible.</p>
                <p>"In order to give some security to the Government, <lb/>that the persons undertaking to make these establish<lb break="no"/>ments have the means of doing so, every person engag<lb break="no"/>ing to take out the above-mentioned number of per<lb break="no"/>sons or families, shall deposit, at the rate of 10l. (to be <lb/>repaid as hereinafter mentioned) for every family so <lb/>taken out, provided that the family does not consist of <lb/>more than one man, one woman, and two children un<lb break="no"/>der 14 years of age. All children ahove the number <lb/>of two must be paid for, in addition to the deposit <lb/>above-mentioned, in the proportion of 5l. for every per<lb break="no"/>son between the ages of 14 and 18.</p>
                <p>"In consideration of this deposit, a passage shall be <lb/>provided at the expence of Government for the settlers, <lb/>who shall be victualled from the time of their em<lb break="no"/>barkation until the time of their landing in the Colony.</p>
                <p>"A grant of land, under the conditions hereafter spe<lb break="no"/>cified, shall be made to him, at the rate of 100 acres <lb/>for every such person or family whom he so takes out ; <lb/>one-third of the sum advanced to Government on the <lb/>outset, shall be repaid on landing, when the victuall<lb break="no"/>ing at the expense of the Government shall cease. A fur<lb break="no"/>ther proportion of one-third shall be repaid, as soon as <lb/>it shall be certified to the Governor of the Colony that <lb/>the settlers, under the direction of the person taking <lb/>them out, are actually located upon the lands assigned to <lb/>them ; and the remainder at the expiration of three <lb/>months from the date of their location.</p>
                <p>"If any parishes in which there may be a redun<lb break="no"/>dancy of population, shall unite in selecting an intelli<lb break="no"/>gent individual to proceed to the Cape, with settlers <lb/>under his direction, not less in number and of the des<lb break="no"/>cription above-mentioned, and shall advance money in <lb/>the proportion above-mentioned, the Government will <lb/>grant land to such an individual at the rate of 100 <lb/>acres for every head of a family, leaving the parish at <lb/>liberty to make such conditions with the individual, <lb/>or the settlers, as may be calculated to prevent the pa<lb break="no"/>rish becoming again chargeable with the maintenance <lb/>of such settlers, in the event of their return to this <lb/>country.</p>
                <p>"But no offers of this kind will be accepted, unless <lb/>it shall be clear that the persons proposing to become <lb/>settlers shall have distinctly given their consent, and <lb/>that the head of each family is not infirm or incapable of <lb/>work.</p>
                <p>"It is further proposed, that in any case in which <lb/>one hundred families proceed together, and apply for <lb/>leave to carry out with them a minister of their own <lb/>persuasion, Government will, upon their being actually <lb/>located, assign a salary to the minister whom they may <lb/>have selected to accompany them, if he shall be ap<lb break="no"/>proved by the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>"The lands will be granted at a quit rent, to be fix<lb break="no"/>ed, which rent, however, will be remitted for the first <lb/>10 years ; and at the expiration of three years (during <lb/>which the party, and a number of families, in the pro<lb break="no"/>portion of 1 for every 100 acres, must have resided on <lb/>the estate) the land shall be measured at the expense <lb/>of Government and the holder shall obtain, without <lb/>fee, his title thereto, on a perpetual quit rent, not ex<lb break="no"/>ceeding[?] in any case of 2l. sterling for every 100 acres <lb/>subject, however to this clause[?] beyond the usual re<lb break="no"/>servations*â€“that the land shall become forfeited to <lb/>Government, in case the party shall abandone the es<lb break="no"/>tate, or not bring it into the cultivator within a given <lb/>number of years. I am, <lb/>"Your most obedient servant."</p>
                <p>* The usual reservations are the right of the Crown <lb/>to mines of precious stones, of gold and silver, and to <lb/>make such roads as may be necessary for the conveni<lb break="no"/>ence of the Colony.</p>
                <p>There are already three extensive settlements on the <lb/>South East Coast of Africa, where the finest wheat is <lb/>produced, with little labour, namely Algoa Bay, St. <lb/>Catherine's Bay, and the new settlement on the Kny<lb break="no"/>sua, a considerable river, which is navigable for large <lb/>vessels to the Northward. There are also extensive <lb/>and fertile lands towards Saldanha Bay. As the pro<lb break="no"/>duce from the new colonists will consist of grain and <lb/>as the markets of the Cape of Good Hope, the Isle of <lb/>France, Brazils &amp;c. will in all probability be soon <lb/>overstocked, the settlers will look to the mother coun<lb break="no"/>try for a market, when an unfavourable harvest renders <lb/>the import necessary ; and in anticipation of this event, <lb/>the merchants interested in the Cape trade intend, we <lb/>understand, to make an application to Government <lb/>respecting the Corn Laws, to put the corn from the <lb/>Cape of Good Hope on the same footing as grain from <lb/>the British North American colonies.</p>
