                <p><hi rend="italic">October</hi>  31. We are informed by very respec<lb break="no"/>table authority, that Mr. M'Gillvry has written <lb/>to the President of the United States, a full and <lb/>sensible account of the rise and progress of the <lb/>disputes subsisting between the Georgians; from <lb/>which statement he expected to prove, to a de<lb break="no"/>monstration, that he has not acted the inconsistent <lb/>part which some have alleged, neither has there <lb/>been such cruelties committed by the Indians.</p>
                <p>From Mr. M'Gillevry's abilities, and consi<lb break="no"/>dering he was educated in Europe, being the son <lb/>of a Scotchman and Indian women, we have no <lb/>reason to expect any savage cruelties from an of <lb/>his people; but, on the contrary, it is rather to <lb/>be presumed that his proposals, which are contain<lb break="no"/>ed in his letter to the President, are of a rational <lb/>nature, and many probably bring about a final and <lb/>an advantageous treaty with the United States.</p>
