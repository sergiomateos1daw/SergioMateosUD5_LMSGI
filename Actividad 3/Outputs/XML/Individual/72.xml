                <p><pb/>A <hi rend="italic">Transfer of </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Conjugal Love.</hi></p>
                <p>On Monday last was married at Stockport, an <lb/>inhabitant of Macclesfield, to a female on whom <lb/>he had fixed his <hi rend="italic">affections</hi>. It is to be observed, <lb/>that he did not toil through the tedious forms of <lb/>courtship, but at once got a wife, as others some<lb break="no"/>times get good places, by <hi rend="italic">purchase</hi> –and, as we <lb/>are informed, the lady was valued at eight guineas <lb/>and thirty yards of Irish cloth, at 2s. 6d. per <lb/>yard–which property he deposited in exchange <lb/>for <hi rend="italic">earthly treasure.</hi> –Whether a wife may be <lb/>cheap or dear at that price, time will shew. Her <lb/>former husband, having seen military service, was <lb/>not to be discomposed at <hi rend="italic">trifles</hi>, and his <hi rend="italic">philosophy </hi><lb/>probably being strengthened on the occasion, he <lb/>attended the happy pair to church, and saw the <lb/>marriage ceremony ; after which they spent the <lb/>evening at the bridegroom's house, where all was <lb/>gaity. The first husband parted with an help<lb break="no"/>mate had <hi rend="italic">borne his sorrows twelve years ;</hi>  and <lb/>the second husband received a <hi rend="italic">partner of his joys, </hi><lb/>after having buried a former one <hi rend="italic">just a week.</hi></p>
