                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">House of Commons.–June 19.</hi></p>
                <p>The Speaker took the Chair at a few minutes before <lb/>four o'clock, and was shortly afterwards summoned by <lb/>the Deputy Usher of the Black Rod, to attend the <lb/>House of Lords.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Speaker</hi>  stated, on his return, that the Royal <lb/>Assent had been given by Commission to several public <lb/>and private bills.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">C. Dundas</hi>  presented a petition from Newbury, <lb/>in the county of Berks, praying for the abolition of sla<lb break="no"/>very in the West Indies.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Planta</hi>  moved for a new writ for the election of <lb/>a member to serve in Parliament, in the room of Lord <lb/>Leveson Gower, who had accepted the office of Chief<lb break="no"/>Secretary for Ireland.–Ordered.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ale-House Licensing Bill.</hi></p>
                <p>On the motion of Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Estcourt</hi>, the house resolved <lb/>itself into a committee on this bill.</p>
                <p>On the clause that no brewer who should himself sup<lb break="no"/>ply public houses with beer, should be allowed to act or <lb/>assist as a Magistrate at any meeting or session for the <lb/>granting of licenses,</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Bernal</hi>  moved that this clause be struck out <lb/>altogether.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">R. Gordon</hi>  supported the clause.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Monck</hi>  thought this the most valuable clause <lb/>in the bill, and that it was no infringemnt, but a sa<lb break="no"/>lutary interference with the jurisdiction of borough <lb/>magistrates.</p>
                <p>Strangers were ordered to withdraw, and the com<lb break="no"/>mittee divided, when there were–Ayes 46–Noes 53– <lb/>Majority against the clause 7.</p>
                <p>Several amendments, verbal and otherwise, were then <lb/>agreed to, amongst which was the omission of the <lb/>words " Cinque Ports," thus excluding that class of <lb/>places from the operation of the bill. <cb/>On the clause being proposed relative to the hours <lb/>during which public houses should be kept open on <lb/>Sundays.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Estcourt</hi>  said, the original clause was to the <lb/>effect that public-houses should be closed during the <lb/>hours of morning and afternoon's divine service, but he <lb/>thought it would be better not to permit publicans to <lb/>allow drinking or tippling on their premises till after <lb/>the usual hour of the conclusion of morning service <lb/>(one o'clock.)</p>
                <p>After a conversation, in which several hon. members <lb/>participated, the clause was agreed to.</p>
                <p>Several other clauses having been then read and agreed <lb/>to, the house resumed ; the report was brought up, or<lb break="no"/>dered to be taken into further consideration on Monday <lb/>next, and printed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Usury Laws.</hi></p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">P. Thompson</hi>  moved the second reading of the <lb/>usury laws amendment bill.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Davenport</hi>  said he should oppose the bill, as <lb/>he considered it to be highly injurious both to the land<lb break="no"/>ed and commercial interests. The hon. members moved <lb/>an amendment, that the bill be read a second time that <lb/>day three months.</p>
                <p>The question on th amendment having been put,</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Chancellor</hi>  of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Exchequer</hi>  suggested <lb/>the propriety of postponing this bill until the next ses<lb break="no"/>sion of parliament. He made this suggestion from no <lb/>unfriendly feeling towards the bill, but merely because <lb/>this was not, he conceived, the most convenient time to <lb/>consider it. The subject ought to be fully considered, <lb/>with a view to get rid of evils that existed, without in<lb break="no"/>terfering with long-continued prejudices. If the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion were postponed he would give the subject the <lb/>best attention in his, ( <hi rend="italic">hear</hi>.)</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Heathcote</hi>  approved of the suggestion of the <lb/>right hon. gentleman, and wished the discussion on the <lb/>question to be postponed till the next session of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps"> L. Foster</hi>  thought that, between the total repeal, <lb/>or the continued existence of the Usury Laws, in their <lb/>present shape, a middle course might be steered. Of <lb/>the bill before the house he thought that, under the <lb/>guise of a simple enactment, it covered one of the great<lb break="no"/>est illusion ever held forth to Parliament or the coun<lb break="no"/>try, for he was convinced that it would effect as com<lb break="no"/>plete and as practicable a repeal of the usury laws as <lb/>could be proposed. It became necessary, therefore, to <lb/>consider the probable operation of that repeal upon all <lb/>the great interest of the country. The bill might give <lb/>relief to few, but would bring injury to many.</p>
                <p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston</hi>  thought the house indebted to <lb/>the hon. member for Dover for bringing in the bill. It <lb/>might be possible to form a bill better than that of the <lb/>hon. member, but his bill was better than the present <lb/>law, and as such he should vote for it.</p>
                <p>The gallery was then cleared, and the house divided, <lb/>when there appeared for the second reading,–Ayes, 52; <lb/>Noes, 40 : majority in favour of the second reading, 12.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Voters' Registration Bill.</hi></p>
                <p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Nugent</hi>  moved the second reading of the <lb/>voters' registration bill, and said that his object in car<lb break="no"/>rying it through the present stage was, that the bill <lb/>might be committed <hi rend="italic">pro forma,</hi>  for the purpose of hav<lb break="no"/>ing certain amendment introduced into it. It would <lb/>then be printed with its amendments, in order that the <lb/>house and the country might have the opportunity of <lb/>considering its details between this and the next session <lb/>of Parliament.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">R. Wilson</hi>  moved, as an amendment, that the <lb/>bill might be read a second time that day six months.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">H. Gurney</hi>  seconded the amendment.</p>
                <p>The question was then put on the amendment, which <lb/>was agreed to, and the bill was ordered to be read a se<lb break="no"/>cond time this day six months.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Salmon Fisheries Preservation Bill.</hi></p>
                <p>On the motion of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chancellor</hi>  of <hi rend="smallcaps">Exche- </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">quer</hi>, the house resolved itself into a committee on the <lb/>salmon fisheries preservation bill.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Ferguson</hi>  proposed the insertion of a clause, <lb/>exempting from the operation of the bill the salmon <lb/>fisheries in the River and Bay of Thurso, in the county <lb/>of Caithness, which are the exclusive property of Sir <lb/>John Sinclair.</p>
                <p>After some conversation the gallery was cleared, and <lb/>the committee divided, when the clause was lost.</p>
                <p>The bill having passed through the committee, the <lb/>report was ordered to be received this day.</p>
                <p>The other orders were then disposed of, and the house <lb/>adjourned at half-past two o'clock.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Friday, </hi><hi rend="italic">June</hi>  20.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">G. Murray</hi>  took the oaths and his seat, on his <lb/>re-election for the county of Perth.</p>
                <p>A number of petitions were presented against the <lb/>continuance of Negreo Slavery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Irish Currency.</hi></p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">G. Hill</hi>  presented a petition from the Chamber <lb/>of Commerce of the city of Londonderry, praying that <lb/>the bill for amending the laws relating to Banks in Ire<lb break="no"/>land might not be allowed to make further progress for <lb/>the present. The petition was laid on the table.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">A. Chichester</hi>  presented a petition from Bel<lb break="no"/>fast, praying a reduction of the duty on coals in Ire<lb break="no"/>land, which was laid upon the table.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scotch Gaols' Bill.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord Advocate</hi>, in moving that this bill be <lb/>read a second time and printed, observed, that it was <lb/>not his intention to press it further during the present <lb/>Session. No man could, however, deny that the <lb/>object of the Bill was of great importance, and he <lb/>proposed, therefore, to have its provisions made <lb/>generally known throughout the country, in order that <lb/>it might be again presented to the house in as perfect a <lb/>shape as possible.</p>
                <p>The bill was then read a second time, and ordered to <lb/>be printed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Committee of Supply.</hi></p>
                <p>In the committee of supply, a number of grants of mi<lb break="no"/>nor importance were agreed to.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">H. Hardinge</hi>  said, he had another resolution to <lb/>propose, but it was in which he expected that a re<lb break="no"/>duction would be made next year. It was, that a sum <lb/>of L283,199, 8s 1d be granted for the expenses of the <lb/>disembodied[?] militia of the united kingdom.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Spring Rice</hi>  said, that within the last twelve <lb/>years there had been two millions and a half expended <lb/>on this body, and that the subject was one which few <lb/>gentlemen took the trouble to look at. He begged to say <lb/>a word upon the Irish militia. There the whole of the <lb/>staff, which was larger than that of England, was with<lb break="no"/>out a private man. Nothing could a more outra<lb break="no"/>geous job than that of the milita in Ireland. The co<lb break="no"/>lonels kept the whole patronage of the regiment, and <lb/>kept up the bands for the amusemen of themselves and <lb/>friends. The militia might have been of service at one <lb/>time in Ireland ; but since that time the present effec<lb break="no"/>tive police had been established, and quite superseded <lb/>it. He trusted Ministers would not suffer this to remain <lb/>if they really wished to be economical, and curtail, if <lb/>not abolish it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Chancellor</hi>  of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Exchequer</hi>  begged to <lb/>assure his hon. friend that he wanted no prompting to <lb/>make any economical reduction. When, however, a <lb/>plan for the reduction of the staff was ready, and it was <lb/>in contemplation, it would be laid before Parliament, <lb/>and he should then be the friend of the definite and li<lb break="no"/>mited powers to which he had alluded.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Hume</hi>  said, the militia had been defended as <lb/>though the country were in hourly danger of invasion <cb/>–as if the country could be taken by surprise. If that <lb/>were so, he would gladly learn of what use were the <lb/>spies, who cost us L450,000 a-year. We had ambas<lb break="no"/>sadors–they were very little better than spies–at an <lb/>expense of L450,00a-year ; and if their cautious ob<lb break="no"/>servance were not sufficient to save the country from <lb/>sudden invasion, he knew no better means, and he cer<lb break="no"/>tainly knew no other advantage which ambassadors and <lb/>consuls could be of.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">New South Wales Bill–Committee.</hi></p>
                <p>On the order of the day having been read for the <lb/>house resolving itself into committee on the New South <lb/>Wales bill.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Huskisson</hi>  moved that the Speaker do leave <lb/>the chair.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">J. Mackintosh</hi>  said, the object of his present <lb/>motion, of which he had previously given notice, was, <lb/>to propose two instruction to the committee on the bill <lb/>which the right hon. gentleman (Mr Huskisson) had <lb/>introduced–first, to the effect that the committee should <lb/>recommend the introduction of a clause for the esta<lb break="no"/>blishment of a trial by jury in New South Wales and <lb/>Van Diemen's Land; and secondly, that it should re<lb break="no"/>commend that a clause be introduced, providing for the <lb/>election of one-third of the Legislative Council from <lb/>among persons enjoying an income of L100 a year, and <lb/>having been free inhabitants of the colonies for the space[?] <lb/>of three years. The best local authories in fa<lb break="no"/>vour of his proposition. Among these he might men<lb break="no"/>tion the names of Governor Hunter, Governor Bligh, <lb/>Mr Bent, the Judge Advocate, Governor Macquarrie, <lb/>and his successor Sir Thomas Brisbane, who had gone <lb/>out to the colony prejudiced against the introduction in<lb break="no"/>to it of these institutions ; but, after two years careful <lb/>investigation of the subject, wrote home in Oct. 1825, <lb/>stating, that there was now no longer any doubt <lb/>about its perfect ripeness for them.–( <hi rend="italic">Hear, hear.)– </hi><lb/>The partial introduction of English institutions into <lb/>immediate practise was the only pledge of a real inten<lb break="no"/>tion on the part of government to introduce them more <lb/>completely in the end. The right hon. gent. concluded <lb/>by moving that instruction be given to the committee <lb/>to recommend the introduction of Trial by Jury into the <lb/>colony, and to allow the inhabitants a voice in the le<lb break="no"/>gislative councils.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Huskisson</hi>  said, in the bill which he had intro<lb break="no"/>duced, it was intended to extend the privilege to the <lb/>government of the country of granting trial by jury <lb/>in all civil cases. His right hon. friend would find, if <lb/>he examined, that the foundation would be laid of grant<lb break="no"/>ing the inhabitants of that colony a share in managing <lb/>their own concerns. At present the legislature propos<lb break="no"/>ed, by way of a first step, to appoint a legislative com<lb break="no"/>mittee for the purpose of watching and controuling <lb/>every measure of the state. All trials should be public, <lb/>under the inspection of a free press, and a population <lb/>jealous of their rights. They should now be prepared <lb/>in the course of a few years for the regular introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of a legislative assembly ; not had he any fears <lb/>when such a change should take place, that it would <lb/>lead to any political convulsion.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Hume</hi>  had every reason to believe, that if, in<lb break="no"/>stead of inflicting a military governemtn, they would <lb/>introduce a portion of representation and the privileges <lb/>of British subjects into New South Wales, it would be <lb/>the most flourishing of the colonies.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Horace Twiss</hi>  said, the knowledge of one fact <lb/>might obviate the necessity for one at least of the <lb/>right hon. gent.'s propsitions, namely, that the gover<lb break="no"/>nor of the colony had the power of extending to the co<lb break="no"/>lonists the right of trial by jury if he should deem it ex<lb break="no"/>pedient.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">James Mackintosh</hi>  here intimated that he <lb/>should not press his amendments. They were accord<lb break="no"/>ingly negatived.</p>
                <p>The house then resolved itself into the Committee <lb/>when several verbal amendments were proposed and <lb/>agreed to.</p>
                <p>The bill then went through the committee, and the <lb/>report, with the amendments, was ordered to be brought <lb/>up on Monday.</p>
                <p>The other orders of the day were then disposed of, <lb/>and the house adjourned at half-past two o'clock.</p>
