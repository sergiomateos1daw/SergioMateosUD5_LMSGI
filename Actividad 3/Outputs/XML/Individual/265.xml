                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">South Australia</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi>  have received the first annual Report of <lb/>new colony of South Australia, a Parliamentary paper <lb/>presented in June last. The site selected for the <lb/>colony is a part of the south coast of New Holland, <lb/>extending two or three hundred miles on each side of <lb/>Spencer's Gulf, and about 600 miles into the interior. <lb/>It was anticipated that the best central station would <lb/>be Port Lincoln at the entrance of Spencer's Gulf, on <lb/>the west side, or Nepean Bay, on the north coast of <lb/>Kangaroo Isle. Port Lincoln is in latitude 35, and <lb/>east longitude 136, about 700 miles right west from <lb/>Sydney, the same distance north-west from Van Die<lb break="no"/>men's Land, and about 1000 miles eastward of the co<lb break="no"/>lony at King George's Sound. Nepean Bay is about <lb/>100 miles east from Port Lincoln. The colony is <lb/>established under Parliamentary Commissioners, as <lb/>an experiment, we believe, to try whether it may not <lb/>be possible to execute an extensive plan of emigration <lb/>without any charge to the country, by selling lots of <lb/>land at such a price as would defray the expense of <lb/>conveying the emigrants from England. The plan <lb/>adopted is, to send out preferably young married per<lb break="no"/>sons under thirty, and to admit no slaves or convicts <lb/>into the colony. A company has embarked t35,000 <lb/>in the enterprise. A surveying vessel was sent out in <lb/>March to examine the coast carefully, that the <lb/>best site might be chosen at first, and the ne<lb break="no"/>cessity of removal avoided. Six vessels altogether <lb/>had sailed down to the 1st May, carrying out 152 male <lb/>labourers with 37 females, and 26 male and 10 fe<lb break="no"/>males of a superior class. These numbers include 26 <lb/>children. The Commissioners attempted at first to <lb/>get 20s. per acre for the land ; but finding it impos<lb break="no"/>sible, they reduced the price to 12s. By selling at <lb/>this price 437 lots, consisting each of a country sec<lb break="no"/>tion of 134 acres, and a town section of one acre, they <lb/>had raised the t35,000 required by the act of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment as the condition of the grant of land. We give <lb/>these few details to put our readers in a condition to <lb/>understand the notices which appear from time to <lb/>time in the papers respecting the colony. We hope <lb/>the Commissioners or the adventurers will give the <lb/>country a distinctive name. The title of "South <lb/>Australia" is bad any way, and even positively ab<lb break="no"/>surd ; since Australia ( <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi>  Australasia,) originally <lb/>intended for New Holland, has already begun to be <lb/>monopolised by Van Diemen's Land. The district <lb/>at Spencer's Gulf, if it is to participated in the general <lb/>denomination, should be termed "North" rather than <lb/>"South" Australia. By the way, most of our colonies <lb/>in that quarter of the world have ridiculous names, as <lb/>is instantly perceived when we coin a nationa term for <lb/>the people out of them. What can be worse than a <lb/>"Van Diemen-lander ;" a "New South-Wales-ian ;" <lb/>a "Swan River-ite ;" or a "King-George's Sound<lb break="no"/>ian ! !"</p>
