                <p>"Our Friend Mr – arrived in town from New <lb/>York a few days ago. On his way he passed three <lb/>days at Plattsburgh, the head-quarters of the Ame<lb break="no"/>rican army, which, from ocular observation, he states <lb/>to consist of 8 or 10,000 men, under the command <lb/>of General Bloomfield, Mooar, and Petit. This <lb/>force is composed of 3 or 4000 regulars, about the <lb/>same number of militia, and some volunteers from the <lb/>southward. The militia is almost all from the state <lb/>of New York, for the Yankees still refuse to march. <lb/>with this force no doubt is entertained here but they <pb/>will make an attack ; and if they mean to make it <lb/>this season, they must be prompt in their movements, <lb/>for the weather is getting cold, and they are not well <lb/>clothed or appointed. Mr –, indeed, states <lb/>half of them to be without shoes or stockings, <lb/>which will never do for a winter campaign in this <lb/>country. To repel the threatened attack, we are <lb/>making every preparation in our power, and the Ca<lb break="no"/>nadians seem well disposed to second the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Sir George Prevost has established a cordon, <lb/>the left of which is at Chambly, and extending to <lb/>Chateaguny ; the main encampment is half way be<lb break="no"/>tween St John's and La Prairie. Colonel Murray <lb/>is at St John's with a battalion ; and the Isle-au<lb break="no"/>Noix is strongly fortified, with a boom and a chain <lb/>secured across the river. This line of defence is <lb/>composed of four regiments of the line, and 2000 <lb/>drafted militia, with a corps of about 400 Canadian <lb/>voltigeurs, raised last spring. The Royals, a very <lb/>strong battalion, lately arrived from the West Indies, <lb/>are now marching to join the camp. The citizens, <lb/>both here and at Quebec, mount guard, and do <lb/>garrison : indeed there are in this island <lb/>(Montreal) five battalions of militia, say 3 to <lb/>4000 men, pretty well disciplined, and who on an <lb/>alarm could march to this cordon in half a day.– <lb/>A new regiment of embodied militia has late<lb break="no"/>ly been formed by drafts from the different regi<lb break="no"/>ments of inrolled militia in this island, and old Major <lb/>Murray is appointed Lieutenant-Colonel. The gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen of the North-west Company army are forming <lb/>a corps of their voyageurs, who will be most useful <lb/>troops to act in advance with the Indians. The <lb/>number originally proposed was 200, but the men <lb/>have come forward so handsomely, that they are to <lb/>consist of 500. Mr M'Gillivray is Lieutenant-Co<lb break="no"/>lonel Commandant of this corps, Mr Shaw, Major, <lb/>and the other partners of the Company are Captains <lb/>and subalterns ; so that the men being commanded <lb/>by those whom they have accustomed to obey, may <lb/>be considered as already disciplined, at least in point <lb/>of subordination.</p>
                <p>"Sir George confines his operations to mere de<lb break="no"/>fence. La Motte, with about 70 Indians, advanced <lb/>through the woods, about ten days ago, within hear<lb break="no"/>ing of this redoubtable army, and set up a war whoop, <lb/>which so completely terrified them that though they <lb/>could see no enemy, they lay on their arms for two <lb/>two successive nights, in no expectation of an attack–to <lb/>prevent which, they cut down their best bridge, and <lb/>destroyed all the roads by which I suppose they mean <lb/>to invade us. Mr –, who was several days at <lb/>their headquarters, and who was offered the rank of <lb/>Lieutenant-Colonel in the army, has, it is said, pro<lb break="no"/>posed to Sir George to destroy their camp with 500 <lb/>men ; and Sir George is said to have replied, that his <lb/>plan was fixed, not to make any attack nor to send a <lb/>man across the line.</p>
                <p>"This forebearance, which the Yankees impute to <lb/>fear or weakness, tends only to increase their insolent <lb/>swaggering, and their enmity is to inveterate to be <lb/>allayed by any thing but hard knocks."</p>
