                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Meeting on Emigration in Dublin.</hi> â€“One of <lb/>the largest and msot influential meetings that we ever <lb/>remember, says the <hi rend="italic">Dublin Monitor</hi>  of Thursday, took <lb/>place on Wednesday, at the Rotunda, to form an As<lb break="no"/>sociation for the Promotion of Emigration to South <lb/>Australia. In rank and numbers it was not surpassed. <lb/>There could not be less than two thousand persons in <lb/>the room. Colonel Torrens dwelt at considerable <lb/>length on the causes of Irish misery, and proved fully, <lb/>at least to our satisfaction, that a powerful and effi<lb break="no"/>cacious remedy was applicable in the objects of the <lb/>meeting. The subject seemed to tell powerfully on <lb/>the meeting ; the speakers were heard with great at<lb break="no"/>tention, and the applauses they received told that the <lb/>public feeling was deeply identified with the future <lb/>colony of New Ireland.</p>
