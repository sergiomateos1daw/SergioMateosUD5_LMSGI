                <p><pb n="4"/><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Message from </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">General Washington </hi><hi rend="italic">to Congress,  <lb/>May </hi>21.</hi></p>
                <p>"Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House <lb/>of Representatives,</p>
                <p>"I lay before you certain information, where<lb break="no"/>by it would appear that some encroachment as <lb/>about to be made on our territory, by an Officer <lb/>and party of British troops. Proceeding upon a <lb/>supposition of the authenticity of this information, <lb/>although of a private nature, I have caused the <lb/>representation to be made to the British Mini<lb break="no"/>ster, a copy of which accompanies this Message.</p>
                <p>"It cannot be necessary to comment upon the <lb/>very serious nature of such an encroachment, nor <lb/>to urge that this new state of things suggests the <lb/>propriety of placing the united States in a posture <lb/>of effectual preparation for an event, which, not<lb break="no"/>withstanding the endeavours making to avert it, <lb/>may, y circumstances beyond our controul, be for<lb break="no"/>ced upon us. <hi rend="flush-right"><hi rend="smallcaps">G. Washington</hi>."</hi></p>
                <p>By a letter from Mr. Randolph, the American <lb/>Secretary of State, to Mr Hammond, the informa<lb break="no"/>tion alluded to we find to be, "That Governor <lb/>Simcoe had gone to the foot of the Rapids of teh <lb/>Miami, followed by three companies of a British <lb/>regiment, in order to build a fort there"ﬂùWhich <lb/>Mr. Hammond, in his answer, rather qualifies than <lb/>denies.</p>
                <p> In the debate in Congress, on taking off the em<lb break="no"/>bargo, several members said they had voted for the <lb/>embargo, merely as a part of a general plan of re<lb break="no"/>taliation upon Great Britain; but that as the more <lb/>effential parts of that plan, particularly the prohi<lb break="no"/>biting of all commercial intercourse between Ame<lb break="no"/>rica and Great Britain had been over-ruled, the <lb/>embargo was injurious only to the subjects of teh <lb/>United States, and therefore ought to be taken off.</p>
                <p>In Philadelphia and several other ports, the mas<lb break="no"/>ters and mates of American ships held meetings, <lb/>and published resolutions, declaring that they would <lb/>not put to sea, until they could be assured that their <lb/>flag would be respected, and their persons <lb/>protected from such indignities as many of them had lately experienced. This they did after the <lb/>embargo was at an end.</p>
