                <p><pb n="2"/> When hostilities are once commenced, a for<lb break="no"/> <lb/>fidable armament will unquestionable be sent a<lb break="no"/>gainst the Spanish South American colonies. Of <lb/>its success there cannot be a doubt, when we shall <lb/>be aided by an army of 20,000 Indian warriors, <lb/>beside the active support of those Mexicans now <lb/><supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> under the tyranous yoke of Spain.</p>
                <p><pb n="3"/> So determined are the Cherokees, the Creeks, <lb/>and other nations of Indians in the Southern parts <lb/>of America, to strip the Spaniards of their pos<lb break="no"/>sessions on that Continent, that they will unque<lb break="no"/>stionably attempt the glorious achievement, even <lb/>though the policy of this country should prevent <lb/>us from lending them effectual assistance.</p>
                <p>The rich silver mines at Potosi, in Peru, were <lb/>accidentally discovered in 1545, by an Indian, as <lb/>he was clambering up the mountain, in pursuit <lb/>of a Lama, which had strayed from his flock. <lb/>Soon after, the mines, of Sacotecas, in New <lb/>Spain, little inferior to the other in value, were <lb/>opened. From that time successive discoveries <lb/>have been made in both colonies, and silver mines <lb/>are now so numerous that the working of them, <lb/>and of some few mines of gold in the provinces <lb/>of Terra Firm, and the new Kingdom of Gre<lb break="no"/>nada, has become the capital occupation of the <lb/>Spaniards, and is reduced into the system no less <lb/>complicated than interesting.</p>
