                <p><pb n="2"/><hi rend="smallcaps">Court of Chancery. </hi><lb/><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">The </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">King</hi>, <hi rend="italic">at the relation of the </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Bishop </hi><hi rend="italic">of </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Lon<lb break="no"/>don </hi>, <hi rend="italic">versus </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Anderson </hi><hi rend="italic">and </hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Gipps</hi>.</hi></p>
                <p>On the 18th of June, 1692, the Hon. Mr. <lb/>Boyle left by will the sum of 5400l. to be laid <lb/>out in lands in Yorkshire, out of the rents of which <lb/>the sum of 90l. was to be paid annually to the <lb/>College of William and Mary, in New England, <lb/>to be applied for the purpose of propagating the <lb/>Christian religion amongst the Indians in the back <lb/>settlements in North America ; and likewise a <lb/>further sum of 45l. to be paid to the same College, <lb/>for the support of two missionaries to preach the <lb/>gospel. The city of London were left trustees, <lb/>and the management under the trust was, by the <lb/>will, committed to the care of the Bishop of Lon<lb break="no"/>don. The present Bishop instituted this suit, in <lb/>which the city, and a great number of other per<lb break="no"/>sons, were parties, for the single, and indeed novel <lb/>purpose of knowing, whether (as the teststor had <lb/>originally devised the several sums <hi rend="italic">for the use of </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">British subjects,</hi>  and the Americans having ceased <lb/>to be in that situations <hi rend="italic">since</hi>  their independence), <lb/>the annuity ought not to revert to this kingdom, <lb/>or to some other of his Majesty's colonies, to be <lb/>applied to similar purposes. This being the first <lb/>determination of that nature since the American <lb/>Revolution, the Lord Chancellor decided it with <lb/>that superior dignity of sentiment that always at<lb break="no"/>tends his decrees. Two phrases are sufficient– <lb/>"all charitable devices are to be held sacred– <lb/>we cannot rake up the ashes of the dead, in search <lb/>of latent intentions. The annuities and arrears <lb/>must be paid, and Messrs. Anderson and Gipps, <lb/>and likewise the city of London, must be paid <lb/>their costs."</p>
