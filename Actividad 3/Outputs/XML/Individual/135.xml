                <p><pb/>Colonial Intelligence <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">York</hi>, (U.C.) Nov, 4.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lord Selkirk vs. North West Company</hi>.</p>
                <p>On Friday, the 30th of October, the Court of Oyer <lb/>and Terminer proceeded to try the gentlemen accused <lb/>as necessaries to the murder of Robert Semple, Esq. <lb/>and others at Red River, on the 19th of June, 1816 <lb/>and the trial was rendered extremely interesting by the <lb/>disclousure which took place of many extraordinary cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances connected with the Hudson's Bya and <lb/>North West Companies, which for some time past has <lb/>excited so much of the public attention in this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince. The gentlemen tried on this occasion were, <lb/>Messrs. Alexander Mackenzie, <lb/>Hugh M'Gillis, <lb/>Simon Fraser, <lb/>John Macdonald, and <lb/>John M'Laughlin <lb/>} accused as accessories <lb/>after the fact. <lb/>and Mr John Severlight, accused as an accessory <hi rend="italic">before </hi><lb/>and <hi rend="italic">after</hi>  the fact.</p>
                <p>It appeared in evidence that the North West Com<lb break="no"/>pany had been upwards of thirty years in possession <lb/>of trading posts called <hi rend="italic">forts</hi>  at different points on the <lb/>Red River in the Indian Territories, and it is well <lb/>known that for a century before the North West Com<lb break="no"/>pany, the Canadian for traders had been in the con<lb break="no"/>stant practise of resorting to that country which was <lb/>visited for the first time by traders of the Hudson's <lb/>Bay Company about twenty-five years ago. It was <lb/>put in evidence that for many years afterwards both <lb/>companies carried on their trade to Red River without <lb/>interference in each others pursuits, and without any <lb/>disturbance in the country ; and it was explained that <lb/>the principal object of the trade being to collect pro<lb break="no"/>visions, (enlisting chiefly of the dried flesh of the buf<lb break="no"/>falo, which abound in the plains) and the country pro<lb break="no"/>ducing abundance for the supply of both parties, the <lb/>same causes of dissention did not exist as at trading <lb/>stations where the fine furs are obtained in small quan<lb break="no"/>tities, and where rival traders would at all times be <lb/>likely to dispute about the divisions of them. The Red <lb/>River country therefore remained quiet and undisturb<lb break="no"/>ed until the arrival of the Earl of Selkirk's Colonists <lb/>and Servants, and the attempts made by their leaders <lb/>to prevent the usual supplies of provisions from being <lb/>obtained by the traders.</p>
                <p>The proclamation of Miles Macdonnell the soi-dis<lb break="no"/>ant <hi rend="italic">Governor of Ossinibour</hi>, prohibiting the exporta<lb break="no"/>tion of provisions from Red River, was the first docu<lb break="no"/>ment produced for the defence at the recent trials. It <lb/>was proved that, under this assumed authority, several <lb/>acts of violence were committed by Mr Macdonnell and <lb/>his followers. Trading posts and buildings were for<lb break="no"/>cibly entered, depots of provisions seized, the river (the <lb/>only outlet from the country) blockaded by batteries <lb/>mounted with cannon, and the trade of the North <lb/>West Company wholly interdicted, before any acts of <lb/>retaliation were attempted on their part, and even be<lb break="no"/>fore they took any precautions for their own defence <lb/>or for ensuring the safety of their provisions, on which <lb/>depended the existence of their trade, and the lives of <lb/>their people.</p>
                <p>Mutual and continual acts of aggression and ret<lb break="no"/>aliation appeared to have exasperated the minds of both <lb/>parties, and to have rendered them so suspicious of the <lb/>designs of each other as to be always on their guard <lb/>and prepared for defence. In short it appeared in <lb/>evidence that the country remained in a state of pri<lb break="no"/>vate war, which at length ended in the <hi rend="italic">battle</hi>  of the <lb/>loch of Jane, 1816. The particulars of this unfort<lb break="no"/>unate affray were fully investigated in the trial of Bouche <lb/>and Brown for murder, as <hi rend="italic">principals</hi>. The state<lb break="no"/>ments on both sides are already before the public, and <lb/>the acquittal of the prisoners shows sufficiently that the <lb/>jury considered Mr Semple and his party to have been <lb/>the assailants. On the trial of the alleged accessories <lb/>the cirumstances which led to the meeting of the hos<lb break="no"/>tile parties were made out in the evidence to the following <lb/>effect, viz : –</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">March</hi>, 1816, Mr Colin Robertson, with an <lb/>armed party, acting under the orders of <hi rend="italic">Governor </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">Semple</hi>, who had succeeded <hi rend="italic">Governor</hi>  Miles Macdonnell <lb/>at Red River, captured by surprise the North West <lb/>trading post at the forks of the river, called <hi rend="italic">Fort </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">Gibraltar</hi>, and took possession of all the stores and <lb/>provisions. In the latter part of the following month <lb/>of May, Governor Semple caused the buildings (which <lb/>were of wood) to be taken to pieces, and the materials <lb/>were floated fown the river in rafts, to be used in con<lb break="no"/>structing his new fort, which he called <hi rend="italic">Fort Douglas </hi><lb/>and where, (following the examples of his predecessors) <lb/>he mounted cannon to command the passage of the <lb/>river, built an armed schooner, or gun-boat, to com<lb break="no"/> <lb/>plete the blockage, and effectually to intercept the pro<lb break="no"/>visions and trade of the North West Company. Mr. <lb/>Alexander Macdonnell, a partner of the North West <lb/>Company, who had charge of their provisions at Ri<lb break="no"/>viere Qui Appele, one of the branches of the Red River, <lb/>became alarmed at these measures of hostility, and as<lb break="no"/>sembled as many people as he could (half breeds and <lb/>others) for the protection of the property under his care, <lb/>with which, at the usual time, he proceeded down the <lb/>river till he arrived within sixty miles of Governor <lb/>Semple's fort. He then landed his provisions, made <lb/>dispositions to defend them, if attacked, and sent a <lb/>party of his people, with a temporary supply to meet <lb/>the canoes from below, apprise them of the blockages, <lb/>and concert with them the means of eluding or re<lb break="no"/>moving it. This party, under the direction of Cuth<lb break="no"/>bert Grant (a half breed, and a clerk of the N. West <lb/>Company) was ordered to land above Fort Douglas <lb/>in order to keep out of the reach of the cannon, and <lb/>to carry these provisions in carts, at as great a distance <lb/>as possible from the fort, so as to avoid being seen.– <lb/>This it was fully proved they did ; but a swamp in the <lb/>rear of the fort compelled them to pass within about <lb/>two miles of it, and being deserted and pursued from <lb/>then, the conflict ensued in which Mr Semple, and <lb/>most of his party, were killed.</p>
                <p>It was further made out in evidence that in the <lb/>Spring of the year 1816, the agent of the North West <lb/>Company at Montreal were still in need of more than <lb/>the usual supply of provisions from the Red River, be<lb break="no"/>cause there had not yet been time to replace the ves<lb break="no"/>sels on the lakes, and the other means of transport <lb/>which the Americans had destroyed during the war, <lb/>nor to replenish their stores at Fort William, with the <lb/>usual quantity of provisions from Canada. Having <lb/>also heard of the seizure of one of their posts at Red <lb/>River in the fall of the year 1815, and apprehending <lb/>further aggressions in the spring, Mr M'Leod, one of <lb/>the agents, with all the partners and clerks who could <lb/>be spared from Montreal, proceeded up the country <lb/>early in the Spring, and on arriving at Fort William, <lb/>received intelligence of the capture of Fort Gibraltar <lb/>and the blockade of Red River, towards which place <lb/>he immediately proceeded with as many of the part<lb break="no"/>ners, clerks, and servants of the Company as he could <lb/>collect by the way, in order to rescue the intercepted <lb/>provisions, in the defence of which, or in their own <lb/>defence, if fired on by Semple's blockading battery, it <lb/>was their avowed purpose to use force if necessary, but <lb/>it was distinctly proved that their intentions and orders <lb/>issued to their cannonmen, were, to pass Fort Douglas <lb/>singing, and to proceed up the river for their provi<lb break="no"/>sions, without landing or molesting any one unless <lb/>they should be attacked.–They arrived at Red River <lb/>three days after the battle, and Mr M'Leod, who was <lb/>a Magistrate, being of opinion that Mr Semple's party <lb/>had been the assailants, and that the half breeds had <lb/>only acted in self defence, did not adopt any measures <lb/>against them, (the half breeds) but, on the contrary, <lb/>expressed approbation for their having defended their <lb/>provisions, and gave them the supplies of clothing, &amp;c. <lb/>usually given to all the servants of the North West <lb/>Company, while, at the same time, he arrest some <lb/>of the survivors of Mr Semple's party, and served sub<lb break="no"/>poenas upon others to give evidence of these transactions <lb/>in the Courts of Lower Canada. <cb/>This was the whole of the evidence, and the only <lb/>circumstances which appeared relative to the prisoners, <lb/>were that Mr Sevewright (the alleged accessory before <lb/>the fact) was with Mr Alexander Macdonnell when he <lb/>sent off Grant and his party to escort the provisions <lb/>past Fort Douglas, and that the alleged accessaries <lb/>after the fact arrived at Red River with Mr M'Leod, <lb/>after the battle was over, and appeared to consider it, <lb/>as it is now found to have been, an affray in which the <lb/>unsuccessful party were to blame, and in which the <lb/>successful party <hi rend="italic">were not murderers</hi> –The Judge who <lb/>presided at the trial, declared in his charge to the jury <lb/>that there was not a <hi rend="italic">scintilla</hi>  of evidence " against any <lb/>one of these gentlemen," and the jury accordinagly re<lb break="no"/>turned a verdict of <hi rend="italic">Not Guilty</hi>.</p>
                <p>It will be recollected that these gentlemen were ar<lb break="no"/>rested by the Earl of Selkirk, at Fort William, in Aug <lb/>1815, on the charges of High Treason and Conspi<lb break="no"/>racy, as well as Murder–and that the buildings and <lb/>property of the North West Company at that place <lb/>were forcibly seized and subsequently retained by an <lb/>armed force under his Lordship's command. The <lb/>North West Company represented at the time that these <lb/>accusations were merely a pretext set up to palliate the <lb/>preconcerted plunder of their property, and destruction <lb/>of their trade, while, on the part of Lord Selkirk, it <lb/>was alleged that the crimes committed by the partners <lb/>of the North West Company were so atrocious, as to <lb/>justify his Lordship's proceedings against them ; and <lb/>for some time the public opinion remained in suspense <lb/>as to the real merits of the case. So far as regarded <lb/>the seizure of property and the interruption of trade, <lb/>the point was decided by the Prince Regent's Procla<lb break="no"/>mation of the 3rd of May, 1817, in consequence of <lb/>which the North West Company recovered possession <lb/>of their property, and re-established their trade ; but <lb/>that proclamation left the rights of parties, and the <lb/>crimes alleged against the individuals, to be investigated <lb/>and decided upon by the law – and until such investi<lb break="no"/>gation could take place, much uncertainty necessarily <lb/>prevailed from the contradictory statements and affida<lb break="no"/>vits which had been laid before the public.</p>
                <p>The recent trials at York however decided the <lb/>point as to the alleged <hi rend="italic">murders</hi>, and the charge of <lb/><hi rend="italic">High Treason</hi>  has never been followed up, nor ever <lb/>mentioned, since it served the desired purpose, by <lb/>figuring in Lord Selkirk's Warrant as a pretext for <lb/>seizing and examining the books and private papers of <lb/>of the North West Company.</p>
