                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to the Cape of Good  <lb/>Hope.  <lb/>(From Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.)</hi></p>
                <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has submitted to <lb/>Parliament the expediency of voting t50,000 towards <lb/>the encouragement of emigration to the Cape of Good <lb/>Hope. Let it be remembered, once for all, that it is <lb/>not because that colony is too thin of inhabitants, but <lb/>that the mother country is too full, that this plan is sug<lb break="no"/>gested. The question is not how you maintain <lb/>a surplus peasantry in the land that gave them birth, <lb/>but, whether you will stop emigration to the frozen <lb/>shores of Canada, and to the United States, or divert <lb/>and encourage it to the finest colony in the world – <lb/>We surely have learnt enough of North America to <lb/>convince us of the degraded and miserable conditions of <lb/>its people. South African, on the other hand, has every <lb/>advantage to repay the sacrifice of quitting the land of <lb/>our forefathers.</p>
                <p>The more fully to understand and appreciate these <lb/>advantages, we shall set before our readers a short view <lb/>of the conditions and facilities of the colony in ques<lb break="no"/>tion.</p>
                <p>The spring, from September to December, is the <lb/>most agreedable season. The summer, from December <lb/>to March, is often intensely hot. The autumn, from <lb/>March to June, is generally fine and pleasant. The <lb/>winter is rainy and stormy, and for the most part so <lb/>cold as to make fires very comfortable during the <lb/>months of July, August, and September. Most of the <lb/>diseases that appear among the natives proceed rather <lb/>from their gross and indolent modes of living, than the <lb/>unheathliness of the climate. The scarcity of water in <lb/>summer is unfavourable to cultivation ; and for want <lb/>of industry or materials this defect is not remedied, as <lb/>it is in India, by artificial tanks or reservoirs. When<lb break="no"/>ever, however, irrigation can be employed, either from <lb/>wells or rivers, the most abundant vegetation ensues. <lb/>Good and abundant water has always been found by <lb/>digging wells in Cape Town and the vicinity. In the <lb/>whole colony there is scarcely a river that can be called <lb/>navigable. Though swollen into torrents during the <lb/>winter, most of them dry up during the summer. All <lb/>the rivers are well stocked with perch, eels and small <lb/>turtle ; and with a certain distance from the coast <lb/>they abound with the several fish peculiar to these seas.</p>
                <p>There is general want of wood in South Africa – <lb/>At the distance, however, of 1.5 miles from Algoa bay <lb/>there is a large forest of a many thousand acres. Some <lb/>of these trees (taxus elongatus) grow to the amazing <lb/>size of 10 feet in diameter, and to the height of 30 or <lb/>40 feet of trunk clear of branches. The wood is use<lb break="no"/>ful for many purposes, but will not bear exposure to <lb/>weather. The iron-wood grows to the size of 3 feet <lb/>in diameter and the trunk straight and very high – <lb/>The Hassayni wood is a beautiful tree...</p>
                <p>The Constantia wine is known throughout Europe, <lb/>and to what perfection the other wines of the colony <lb/>are capable of being brought, may very fairly be au<lb break="no"/>gured for the great improvement that has already ta<lb break="no"/>ken place in its manufacture. Heretofore, the Dutch <lb/>farmer and the merchant have regarded more the quan<lb break="no"/>tity than the quality of their wine. And when a car<lb break="no"/>go was once shipped, it mattered little to them, whe<lb break="no"/>ther sound or sour it reached its destination. Little <lb/>care was taken in the growth of the vine ; the branches <lb/>were permitted to rest upon the groun ; while decay<lb break="no"/>ed and unripe grapes, stalks and leaves, were all pro<lb break="no"/>miscuously thrown in the wine-press. The mode <lb/>also of seasoning the casks with brimstone, and the <lb/>want of good brandy to fit it for foreign markets, have <lb/>all contributed to deteriorate the character and confine <lb/>the sale of Cape Madeira. These defects have lately <lb/>been in a great measure remedied. Proper persons <lb/>have been sent out from Madeira and this country, and <lb/>every care seems now taken to meet and secure the <lb/>growing demand in European markets. The trifling <lb/>duty affixed to Cape Madeira in this country, has been <lb/>the means of introducing it into many families, which <lb/>have hitherto used home-made wines. And though the <lb/>merchants at Madeira have made many remonstrances <lb/>on this preference, it surely is but equitable that en<lb break="no"/>couragement should be given to the stape export of a <lb/>colony, now decidely, and we must trust unalterably, Eng<lb break="no"/>lish. But in addition to wines there are other articles <lb/>of colonial growth, exported to the East Indies, Eu<lb break="no"/>rope, and America. Grain, wool, bides, and skins, <cb/>whale oil and bone, dried fruits, salt provisions, soap <lb/>and candles, aloes, tobacco. Such are the articles of <lb/>commerce that might be turned to the best account. – <lb/>But neither trade nor prosperit of any kind will con<lb break="no"/>tinue to thrive in this colony, under the present mode <lb/>of administering its government and laws. It has been <lb/>said, that despotism would be the best of governments <lb/>were the despot virtuous. This may be ; but conti<lb break="no"/>tuted as human nature is, we fear that the purest a<lb break="no"/>mongst us needs some control. Control, however, <lb/>there is none over the governor at the Cape. He makes <lb/>and annuls laws at pleasure. He inserts a proclama<lb break="no"/>tion in the Cape Gazette, and from that moment <hi rend="italic">his </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">fiat</hi>  becomes the law of the land. He has indeed an <lb/>adviser in the colonial secretary, whose influence does <lb/>not extend beyond that of mere advice. Strange to <lb/>add, the laws at the Cape are at this moment Dutch <lb/>laws, rescinded and obscured by all the edicts of the <lb/>different governors of the colony. All pleadings are <lb/>in writing, and were, till laterly, carried on, <hi rend="italic">foribus </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">clausis</hi>. In 1797 a court of appeal for criminal and <lb/>civil cases was established, over both of which the go<lb break="no"/>vernor presides. In India, in the West Indies, and in <lb/>Canada, there is a governor and a council. These act <lb/>as checks upon each other. But at the Cape there is <lb/>no appeal beyond the governor.</p>
                <p>The taxes, however, at the Cape, under which we <lb/>groan so painfully in this country, are comparatively <lb/>trifling. European luxuries very justly pay a heavy <lb/>import duty, but their purchase is matter of choice.– <lb/>This falls not upon the poor, not consequently will it <lb/>fall upon those most likely to emigrate under the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the Parliamentary grant.</p>
                <p>Noting indeed can be framed with greater care and <lb/>precautions, than the encouragement bedd out in Mr <lb/>Vansittuart's proposal. A small deposit, L. 10. is to be <lb/>made at the colonial office in Downing Street, by each <lb/>individual. A free passage is to be granted, and on <lb/>reaching the Cape, this deposit is to be returned to the <lb/>settler by the local government. And such is the li<lb break="no"/>berality that has guided the proposed plans, it is more<lb break="no"/>over stipulated, that if 100 families should agree to <lb/>emigrate, and their minister with them, not only <lb/>permission will be granted them so to do, but provi<lb break="no"/>sion will be made for him. The separation from coun<lb break="no"/>try and from kindred is thus softened, and it will allay <lb/>many a sorrowing regret and painful recollection that <lb/>in distant lands, and amongst a strange people, the <lb/>settler may still listen to the voice and instruction of a <lb/>pastor, to whom custom, veneration, and affection, have <lb/>all united to attach him.</p>
                <p>It appears that the experiment of a settlement of Eng<lb break="no"/>lish, has already been made upon a limited plan at <lb/>Saldanha Bay (the finest harbour in South Africa) : <lb/>and with such success as to give the best encourage<lb break="no"/>ment to a more extensive emigration. Indeed, from <lb/>what we have outselves seen of the colony and its great <lb/>facilities, we have no doubt whatever of the benefits <lb/>that must arise to the sober, steady exertions of the in<lb break="no"/>dustrious. At the Cape, or elsewhere, poverty and <lb/>misery will attend the vicious and indolent, but <lb/>certain we are, that there is no country under heaven, <lb/>where the poor may find a safer asylum, and where ac<lb break="no"/>tivity, economy and good conduct, will meet with so <lb/>certain and full a reward.</p>
                <p>During the stay of the 93rd regiment of foot (a <lb/>Scotch regiment) at the Cape, many of the privates <lb/>were known to save the whole of their pay, and were <lb/>thus enabled to return to England with a very hand <lb/>some little fortune. English servants of all descrip<lb break="no"/>tions are in great request, and 1.5 sterling a month are <lb/>no uncommon wages for a tolerable cook. It is never<lb break="no"/>theless to beremember, that clothes of all kinds are <lb/>expensive at the Cape, as no manufactory is permitted, <lb/>lest it should injure the trade of this country. Still <lb/>farmers in the country dress very coarsely and cheaply ; <lb/>and their wives and daughters, except on Sunday, are <lb/>humbly clad as themselves. Indeed, in so soft a <lb/>climate as the Cape, there is that occasion for mul<lb break="no"/>tiplicity and warmth of apparel which colder regions <lb/>require. For three-fourths of the year, the best bed is <lb/>a hard mattress with a single coverlet.</p>
                <p>There is point which we cannot pass over ; as <lb/>we think it very intimately connected with the virtue <lb/>and happiness of the settlers. And that is, the educa<lb break="no"/>tion of their children. Nothing is more neglected than <lb/>this in Southern Africa. The boors, (farmers) are <lb/>ignorant to a degree passing credence. With the mi<lb break="no"/>nister that is to accompany 100 families, it would be <lb/>highly expedient to send a few sober intelligent men as <lb/>schoolmasters. Attempts have been lately made to in<lb break="no"/>troduce into the colony the Madras system of instruc<lb break="no"/>tion, and a free school upon that plan has been esta<lb break="no"/>blished at Cape Town, with considerable success. Still <lb/>the natives are stubbornly averse to instruction. Their <lb/>luxurious and bountiful climate supplies them with all <lb/>the necessaries of human life, and beyond this they <lb/>have neither wish nor ambition. But if knowledge has <lb/>its fruits, ignorance has its weeds. The savage and <lb/>unparalleled cruelties that have heretofore been ex<lb break="no"/>ercised towards their slaves and the Hottentot servants <lb/>by these Dutch boors may very fairly be traced to want <lb/>of education, as a main cause. The unjust limits <lb/>shown by the Dutch laws to the <hi rend="italic">white</hi>  man's barbari<lb break="no"/>ties have doubtless encouraged their perpetration – <lb/>Cruelty is not the character of Englishmen, and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, too much care cannot be taken to guard the fa<lb break="no"/>milies of the new settlers against the contagion of the <lb/>inhumanities that they must see practised around them, <lb/>and how far an early and thorough acquaintance with <lb/>our duty to God and man will counteract this influence <lb/>aided a knowledge of common school attainments, <lb/>we need not say. The</p>
                <p>We have thrown these remarks together more as <lb/>loose hints for the consideration of our readers, than <lb/>with any idea of furnishing a complete view of so wide <lb/>and important a subject. We may be induced here<lb break="no"/>after to review the question more in detail. The plan <lb/>itself, as confessed by the Chanceller of the Exchequer, <lb/>has at present assumed a very imperfect shape. Ame<lb break="no"/>rice we have not seen, and can only speak from the <lb/>reports of other. Those reports are sufficiently dis<lb break="no"/>couraging. On the contrary, all who have seen and <lb/>described the Cape, have united in praising it. Food <lb/>is cheap and abundant, the price of labour is exceed<lb break="no"/>ingly high, trade is important and increasing, many <lb/>parts of the colony are beautiful, and its climate is <lb/>mild and healthy. There are few countries upon earth <lb/>where so many components of happiness will be found <lb/>to concentrate.</p>
