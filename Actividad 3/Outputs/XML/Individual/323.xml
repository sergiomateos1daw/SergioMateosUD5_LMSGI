                <p><pb n="3"/><hi rend="italic">Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Muskingum  <lb/>to his Friend in the City of Norwich, (Connecti<lb break="no"/>cut,) dated Nov</hi>. 24, 1790.</p>
                <p>"The prospect of peace from our frontiers, <lb/>seems to me to be vanished for the present; the <lb/>troops from this garrison have this morning re<lb break="no"/>turned, and the best account I can collect of the <lb/>expedition is as follows: viz. the troops amount<lb break="no"/>ing to about 1200 militia, and about 300 regulars, <lb/>after seventeen days march from Miami, reached <lb/>the great Miami village, about 170 miles, with<lb break="no"/>out any molestation, except having a number of <lb/>their pack-horse stole.–On their arrival they <lb/>found the village deserted, and all the valua<lb break="no"/>ble builder a short tarry, they proceeded to neigh<lb break="no"/>ings set on flames by the Indians. Af<lb break="no"/>bouring villages, without molestation, and def<lb break="no"/>troyed five of them, and a quantity of corn, com<lb break="no"/>puted at fifteen thousand bushels, which they <lb/>found buried in different places, and very large <lb/>quantities of vegetables of every kind. The fir<supplied reason="copy blur">st</supplied> <lb/>opposition that was met with, a party of about <lb/>150 Kentucky militia, and thirty regular troops, <lb/>all under the command of Col. Hardin, of Ken<lb break="no"/>tucky, were detached from the main body, lying <lb/>in the great Miami village, to pursue the track <lb/>of a party of Indians which had the day before <lb/>been discovered. After a pursuit of about six <lb/>miles, they came up with, and were attacked by <lb/>surprise, by a body of Indians, who were con<lb break="no"/>cealed in the thickets on every side of a large <lb/>plain; and on the first onset the militia, without <lb/>exchanging a single fire, made a most precipitate <lb/>retreat, and left the regular troops to stand the <lb/>whole charge of the Indians; the conflict was <lb/>short and bloody; the troops were soon overpower<lb break="no"/>ed by numbers, and all fell, except the two offi<lb break="no"/>ers and two or three privates, after defending <lb/>themselves at their bayonet points with the great<lb break="no"/>est possible obstinacy. Ensign Hartshorn, of <lb/>Franklin, was one of the four that escaped, and <lb/>his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly <lb/>circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat, <lb/>and by that means screening himself from the eye <lb/>of his pursuers, that from any other circumstance. <lb/>Captain Armstrong, who commanded the party, <lb/>likewise made his escape, by plunging himself in<lb break="no"/>to a pond or swamp, up to his neck, within two <lb/>hundred yards of the field of action, where he re<lb break="no"/>mained the whole night, as a spectator of the hor<lb break="no"/>rid scene of the War Dance, performed over the <lb/>dead and wounded bodies of the poor soldiers that <lb/>had fallen the preceding day, where their shrieks, <lb/>mixed with the horrid yells of the savages, ren<lb break="no"/>dered his situation shocking. After this, some <lb/>few skirmishes succeeded, but nothing material, <lb/>until the second capital action, which happened <lb/>two days after the army left the Miami village. <lb/>At ten miles distance from the town, the Gene<lb break="no"/>ral ordered a halt, and detached from four to five <lb/>hundred militia, and about sixty regular soldiers, <lb/>commanded by Major Wylls, all under the com<lb break="no"/>mand of Col. Harden, with orders to march back <lb/>to the town. On their first entrance into the <lb/>town, there appeared a small body of Indians, <lb/>who immediately fled at the first onset, and by <lb/>that means decoyed the whole body of militia, by <lb/>making their flight into different directions, and <lb/>encouraging the militia to pursue; by this means <lb/>the regular troops were left alone, and the Indi<lb break="no"/>ans had effected their design; for the moment <lb/>they found the small handful of regular troops de<lb break="no"/>tached from the main body of militia, they com<lb break="no"/>menced the attack with their whole force, except<lb break="no"/>ing the flying parties that had diverted the mili<lb break="no"/>tia; and although they soon found some part of <lb/>the militia returning on their back, pursued their <lb/>object of routing and destroying the troops; as <cb/>the only sure plan of success; which, after the bloody <lb/>conflict on each side, they effect. The regular <lb/>troops, all to nine, including two commissioned <lb/>officers, were killed and disabled, and a total de<lb break="no"/>feat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls, <lb/>of Hartford, and Lieut. Frothingham, of Mid<lb break="no"/>dletown. Of the militia, it is said, about an hun<lb break="no"/>dred were killed, among whom were a number <lb/>of brave and valuable characters. The Indians, <lb/>it appears, from some cause, did not think it pru<lb break="no"/>dent to pursue their successes from the field of ac<lb break="no"/>tion, for most of the troops that were not killed, <lb/>or sorely wounded, made their escape, which they <lb/>never could have done had the Indians pursued <lb/>with their usual fury.</p>
                <p>"Nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the <lb/>Indians on this occasion; the militia they appear<lb break="no"/>ed to despise, and with all the undautedness <lb/>conceivable, threw down their guns, and rushed <lb/>upon the bayonets of the regular soldiers; a great <lb/>number of them fell; but being so far superior in <lb/>numbers soon overpowered them, for while the <lb/>poor soldier had his bayonet in one Indiaman, <lb/>two more would sink their tomahawks in his head. <lb/>The defeat of our troops was complete, the dead <lb/>and wounded were left on the field in possession <lb/>of the savages.</p>
                <p>"No damage, of any consequence, has been <lb/>sustained in this part of the country from the In<lb break="no"/>dians; but what effect the expedition may have <lb/>on us, as relates to our frontier, it uncertain.– <lb/>If the Western Indians have any idea of treating <lb/>for peace, we shall be safe; if not, we are much <lb/>exposed."</p>
