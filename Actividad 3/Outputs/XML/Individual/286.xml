                <p>The woodland wild ! – wilt thou go with me, <lb/>Where the squirrel is perchen on his oaken tree,– <lb/>where the yellow fern doth wave its head,– <lb/>Where the hands of night the dew hath laid,– <lb/>And the winds, that wander to and fro, <lb/>Kiss the brown leaflets as they go,– <lb/>Where the morning sun peeps in, so mild, <lb/>To the dark green nooks of the woodland wild ? <lb/>The woodland wild ! –where the dun deer roam, <lb/>And the song-birds build them a happy home,– <lb/>Where the grass is green, and the turf so sweet, <lb/>Seems shorn by the tread of fairy feet,– <lb/>Where the daylight comes, so richly dim, <lb/>And the cushat's coo seems a hermit's hymn, <lb/>The care-worn heart might be self-beguiled <lb/>To forget its woes in the woodland wild ! <lb/>The woodland wild ! –where the hazels grow, <lb/>Where the ladye-broom doth its branches throw,– <lb/>Where the God-built sky is in patches seen <lb/>Through the roof of leaves. There aye hath been <lb/>The home of those wild and fairy flowers <lb/>That gladden all Nature's life and ours, <lb/>As they bloom by the stream,–that prattling child, <lb/>That wanders along through the woodland wild ! <lb/>The woodland wild !–If thy heart be pure, <lb/>If thy faith in the right be firm and sure, <lb/>Go, wander the woodlands parth within, <lb/>And the love of Nature woo and win; <lb/>Drink of the cup of beauty there, <lb/>Where the breath of Omnipotence scents the air; <lb/>For the Father of beauty in love hath smiled <lb/>On the sweet green bowers of the woodland wild <lb/>The woodlan wild !–long, long ago, <lb/>I have buried myself its leaves below, <lb/>And dreamed of its beauteous tenants all,– <lb/>'Tis the linnet's home and fairies' hall! <lb/>'Tis the spot where the wondrous monk of old, <lb/>His hermitage reared in the pleasant wold; <lb/>By its door a crystal springlet boiled, <lb/>For the pilgrim to drink, in the woodlan wild! <lb/>The woodland wild !–what pleasant stories <lb/>Make sunlight over its olden glories,– <lb/>Of Robin Hood and his bowmen bold, <lb/>The raids they made, and the tales they told ! <lb/>In winter, in spring, and in summer time, <lb/>The glorious forests are aye in prime ; <lb/>For glad thoughts forever are round them piled, <lb/>Those grassy glades in the woodland wild! <lb/>The woodland wild!–make haste.–make haste! <lb/>Away with me, and its gladness taste; <lb/>We will wander beside each gushing stream, <lb/>Where flowers in the water reflected gleam; <lb/>We will follow its paths and pluck its flowers, <lb/>And lie on its grass in the evening hours, <lb/>Till the dying sunlight, soft and mild, <lb/>Warns us away from the woodland wild ! <lb/><hi rend="italic">Tail's Magazine</hi></p>
