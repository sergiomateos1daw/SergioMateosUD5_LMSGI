                <p>"The seizure, trial, and execution of two <lb/>men, said to be British subjects, by our military <lb/>folks, who lately invaded, the Spanish Territory, <lb/>seems to be confirmed by accounts from the <lb/>south, with a lament added thereto, that another <lb/>of the same nation had not been catched and <lb/>killed. If these accounts should prove true, I <lb/>think the President will as good reason for <lb/>recommending to Congress, at the next session, <lb/>the abolition of the army, as he had at the last, <lb/>for doing away the naval forces on the lakes– <lb/>because it was more likely to involve us in war, <lb/>than to give us security and peace. A little <lb/>while ago we made quite a bluster and noise be<lb break="no"/>cause the King of Spain had imprisoned one of <lb/>our citizens at Cadiz; but the nation seems to <lb/>rest very easy at present with the above named <lb/>executions. Why?–because the wrong is com<lb break="no"/>mitted by us, not against us."</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter, dated Washington city, <lb/>June 2. 1818:–" The British Consul-General, <lb/>A. St. John Baker, is about to depart for Eu<lb break="no"/>rope; the ostensible cause of his departure is the <lb/>recovery of his health, but it is sufficient to look <lb/>in his face to see that it is only a common diplo<lb break="no"/>matic disease, which may be aggravated or cured <lb/>at discretion ; the real object is diplomatic ; the <lb/>English Cabinet has expressed some hesitation <lb/>in regard to certain subjects in Mr Bagot's dis<lb break="no"/>patches ; the speculation carrying on between the <lb/>Spanish agents and some persons in this place <lb/>opens a field of corruption so wide and compre<lb break="no"/>hensive. Mr Baker goes prepared to state the facts, <lb/>from his immediate knowledge ; for no man is <lb/>better acquainted with men and things here.– <lb/>The Chevalier Colonel Sarmiento is also prepar<lb break="no"/>ing to visit Madrid, but his business appears to <lb/>relate to mercantile affairs of some Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans on the west coast ; he received 27,000 dol<lb break="no"/>lars for one service of this king, but the object <lb/>for which he received the douceur failed, and he <lb/>will not refund."</p>

                <p>Washington, May 25, 1818. <lb/>SIR–The act of Congress, "concerning navigation," hereto <lb/>annexed, which is to take effect the first day of October <lb/>next, so materially changes the commerce of the United <lb/>States with the colonies and territories of Britannic Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty, thata due regard to the convenience and interest of <lb/>those engaged in it requires that the construction of the act <lb/>should at this time be determined.</p>
                <p>According to the term used un ther the first section of the <lb/>act, every port or place in the British colonies and territories <lb/>in the West Indies, and on the continent of America, must <lb/>be considered as closed against vessels of the United States, <lb/>to which they are not by act of Parliament permitted to carry <lb/>on the same trade, both in exports and imports, which is <lb/>now, or shall be, carried on in British vessels between the <lb/>ports of the United States and the ports of any British colony <lb/>or territory.</p>
                <p>The permissions by act of Parliament to vessels of the <lb/>United States to go in ballast to Turk's Island, and bring <lb/>away salt, or to carry certain articles to one or more of the <lb/>Bahama Islands, and bring away salt, and a few other ar<lb break="no"/>ticles, cannot be considered as opening the ports of those <lb/>islands to the vessels of the United States, according to the <lb/>intention of the act of Congress, whilst British vessels are <lb/>permitted to carry on the same trade in articles prohibited to <lb/>vessels of the United States.</p>
                <p>It may be proper to observe, that the prohibition in the <lb/>first section applies equally to vessels whether in ballast or <lb/>with cargoes.</p>
                <p>The form of the bond required by the second section of <lb/>the act is hereunto annexed. It is expected that proper cir<lb break="no"/>cumspection will be exercised in requiring a security, as much <lb/>of the efficacy of the act will depend upon the judicious dis<lb break="no"/>charge of this part of your duty.</p>
                <p>I am, very respectfully, Sir, your most obedient servant, <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Wm. H. Crawford. </hi><lb/>Collector of the Port of Alexandria, D.C.</p>

                <p>Extract of a Letter, dated Laguira, May 11. <lb/>"General Morillo has obtained a victory at <lb/>Coxeder, eleven leagues from St Carlos, over <lb/>Paez, who had under his command about 1500 <lb/>cavalry, and 600 or 800 infantry, out of which <lb/>1000 men were killed, and 400 horses and three <lb/>stand of colours taken. The Spaniards lost 100 <lb/>in killed and wounded. This took place on the <lb/>2d instant."</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter, dated from St Thomas, 26th May. <lb/>"We have the official news here from Carac<lb break="no"/>cas, that another battle had been fought on the <lb/>11th instant, about 20 leagues west from San <lb/>Carlos, in which both parties seem to have fought <lb/>with desperation. The Spaniards say that the <lb/>Patriots are totally defeated, but acknowledge <lb/>the loss of many first rate officers. The Com<lb break="no"/>mander in Chief of the Royal army engaged (De <lb/>La Torre) is severely wounded, and his Aid-de<lb break="no"/>Camp (Colonel Villars), and about 20 officers <lb/>killed and wounded.
