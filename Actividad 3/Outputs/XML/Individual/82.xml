                <p>"The drafts at Cork yesterday received the a<lb break="no"/>greeable orders to return to their respective regi<lb break="no"/>ments immediately.</p>
                <p>"The officers appointed to raise independent <lb/>companies in Ireland, have received orders to re<lb break="no"/>pair forthwith to England, with whatever com<lb break="no"/>plement of men already entered, but not to <lb/>proceed with the completion of their number : <lb/>in conference to this order, they are preparing <lb/>for their immediate departure.</p>
                <p>"Last Tuesday two eminent merchants of <lb/>this city received orders, by way of a vessel ar<lb break="no"/>rived at Cork, from Mess de Fouseca Olivarez <lb/>and Co. at Seville, for the immediate exportation <lb/>of cotton, white linen, and mixed goods, to a <lb/>very large amount.</p>
                <p>"Monday evening the Elizabeth and Mary, <lb/>Mark Purcell, master, arrived at Waterford from <lb/>Annapolis, in Maryland, after a long and dan<lb break="no"/>gerous passage, of 52 days, in which they had <lb/>nearly exhausted the whole of their provisions, <lb/>having been a very short allowance of half a <lb/>naggin of rum, diluted with one pint of bad wa<lb break="no"/>ter, for twenty-four hours. She is heavy laden, <lb/>having on board six hundread hogsheads of tobac<lb break="no"/>co, a large quantity of pipe staves, barrel hoops, <lb/>&amp;c. and has been expected more than two months. <lb/>Eight per cent was offered as insurance on ship <lb/>and cargo, but refused, on account of the then <lb/>probability of a war."</p>
