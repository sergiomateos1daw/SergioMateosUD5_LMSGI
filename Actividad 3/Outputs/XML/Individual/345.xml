                <p><pb n="4"/><hi rend="italic">NOOTKA SOUND.</hi></p>
                <p>The circumstances of thetrade and situation <lb/>of this part of North America being a matter of <lb/>such general conversation and great public mo<lb break="no"/>ment, we are particularly happy in being enabled <lb/>to give some further account of the transactions, <lb/>that have happened at Nootka Sounds, as well as <lb/>to point out the advantages that were likely to <lb/>be extended to other places by the means of this <lb/>trade.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to remark that the skin of the <lb/>sea otter is worn only in the Northern regions of <lb/>China. Its fur, though beautiful and magnifi<lb break="no"/>cent, is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of <lb/>the Southern Provinces.</p>
                <p>Pekin is, therefore, the proper mart for this <lb/>valuable commodity, and in this immense city, <lb/>the consumption is so great, that the produce of <lb/>the voyage meets and immediate sale.</p>
                <p>The Mandarins of the Court, and even the <lb/>Emperor himself, are fond of wearing this costly <lb/>fur. To a citizen of common rank, a sea otter's <lb/>collar to his vestment is a luxury.</p>
                <p>The natives of the North West Coast of Ame<lb break="no"/>erica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds, <lb/>that all the blankets, cloths, hats, and stockings, <lb/>that could be procured in China, if English ma<lb break="no"/>nufacture, were sold to the Indians, with whose <lb/>Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed.</p>
                <p>An act of cruelty committed by an officer of <lb/>the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to <lb/>be recorded.</p>
                <p>The Spaniards discovering that Callicum, a <lb/>Chief, second in authority at Nootka Sound, was <lb/>in alliance with the English, he was shot through <lb/>the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife <lb/>of Callicum, with an infant child, escaped, but <lb/>not till wounded.</p>
                <p>Macquilla, the Chief, first in command, re<lb break="no"/>tired at the head of the allies of England, from <lb/>Nootka Sound, and to avoid the cruelty of the <lb/>Spaniards, they fled to distant parts. Such of <lb/>the natives as they could seize, the Spaniards <lb/>condemned to work as slaves on their fortifica<lb break="no"/>tions.</p>
                <p>At this period it was in the contemplation of <lb/>the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands, with <lb/>a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. <lb/>And we further add, on authority that amounts <lb/>nearly to demonstration, that on the very lands <lb/>purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain <lb/>Mears, the Spaniards have already opened valuable <lb/>mines.</p>
                <p>Another object of this enterprise wasto sup<lb break="no"/>ply the markets of Kamschatka, and other ports <lb/>belonging to the Russians, with the teas and other <lb/>produce of China. This promised to be an in<lb break="no"/>valuable channel of commerce, as the Chinese <lb/>have shut their ports against the Russians, who <lb/></p>
                <p>On this voyage of discovery and experiment, <lb/>one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo, <lb/>but was unfortunately lost on her return to China.</p>
                <p>To these curious particulars we add, with a <lb/>patriot joy, that the consumption of the glorious <lb/>staple of England, her broad cloths, is astonish<lb break="no"/>ingly great in Japan and China: British hard<lb break="no"/> <lb/>ware, &amp;c. is also in great request.</p>
                <p>From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears, <lb/>ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may <lb/>depend on the utmost attention and civility. <lb/>This Prince is six feet 4 1/2 inches high, of propor<lb break="no"/>tionate bulk.</p>
