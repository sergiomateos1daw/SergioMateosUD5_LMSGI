                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration</hi>.</p>
                <p>The increased population of this country, as <lb/>well as the great difficult to which the mid<lb break="no"/>dling classes of society are exposed in their ef<lb break="no"/>forts to procure the ordinary means of suste<lb break="no"/>nance, has given rise to the formation of little <lb/>copartnerships, or joint stock companies of in<lb break="no"/>dividuals, who, being unable to command capi<lb break="no"/>tal enough singly, to encounter the expences of <lb/>a new settlement, have put their little funds to<lb break="no"/>gether, with a determination to sail for America, <lb/>and there jointly to labour for the general good <lb/>of the whole, until fortune shall so far favour <lb/>their efforts as to enable them to become inde<lb break="no"/>pendent of each other. By this means much less <lb/>than the hundred pounds stipulated by Mr Birk<lb break="no"/>beck as the proper stock for an emigrant to be<lb break="no"/>gin with, will be sufficient ; and thus a new im<lb break="no"/>petus will be given to that tide of huma beings <lb/>which is constantly flowing towards the new <lb/>world. Would it not be policy to give encou<lb break="no"/>ragement to these industrious swarms to settle in <lb/>our own colonies? We have heard with some <lb/>pleasure in rumour that several parishes have <lb/>taken into their serious consideration the pru<lb break="no"/>dence of establishing a fund for the encourage<lb break="no"/>ment of those poor persons who may be dispo<lb break="no"/>ed to seek a means of occupation in Canada ; <lb/>in furtherance of which laudable design, an ap<lb break="no"/>plication is to be made to Government for grants <lb/>of land in desirable siutations, especially in Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada, where the climate is described to be <lb/>of the finest description. There is no doubt that <lb/>many who are now pining in workhouses would <lb/>gladly accept of such an alternative, and who, <lb/>instead of being, as at present, a burthen to them<lb break="no"/>selves and to society, would, by their exertions, <lb/>be adding to the importance and stability of our <lb/>possessions in that quarter, as well as open<lb break="no"/>ing a new source for the consumption of our ma<lb break="no"/>nufactures.</p>
