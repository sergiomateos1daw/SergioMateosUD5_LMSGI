                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">The SPEECH of </hi><hi rend="smallcaps"> George Washington </hi><hi rend="italic">, Esq;</hi></hi> <lb/><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">President of the Congress, on<supplied reason="copy blur">??? the ???</supplied> </hi></hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">House of Representatives,</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="enlarged-capital">I</hi> N meeting you again, I feel much satisfac<lb break="no"/> <lb/>tion on being able to repeat my congratulations <lb/>on the favourable prospects which continue to di<lb break="no"/>tinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits <lb/>of another year have blessed our country with plen<lb break="no"/>ty, and with the means of flourishing commerce. <lb/>The progress of the public credit is witnessed by <lb/>a considerable rise of American stock abroad, as <lb/>well as at home; and the revenues allotted for <lb/>this and other national purposes, have been pro<lb break="no"/>ductive beyond the calculation by which they were <lb/>regulated. This latter circumstance is the more <lb/>pleasing, as it is not only a proof the fertility of <lb/>our resources, but as it assures us of a further in<lb break="no"/>crease of the national respectability and credit; <lb/>and let me add, as it bears an honourable testi<lb break="no"/>mony to the patriotism and integrity of the ma<lb break="no"/>rine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the <lb/>former in discharging their engagements has <lb/>been exemplary.</p>
                <p>"In conforming to the power vested in me <lb/>by acts of the last session, a loan of 3,000,,000 of <lb/>florins, towards which some provisional measures <lb/>had previously taken place, has been completed <lb/>in Holland.–As well the<supplied reason="copy blur">exchange</supplied> with which it <lb/>has been filled, as the nature of the terms (consi<lb break="no"/>dering the more than ordinary demand for bor<lb break="no"/>rowing, created by the situation of Europe) give <lb/>a reasonable hope that the further execution of <lb/>those powers, may proceed with advantage and <lb/>success. The secretary of the treasure has my <lb/>direction to communicate such further particu<lb break="no"/>lars as may be requisite for more precise infor<lb break="no"/>mation.</p>
                <p>"Since your last sessions, I have received commu<lb break="no"/>nication, by which it appears, that the district <lb/>of Kentucke, at present a part of Virginia, has <lb/>concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state, in consequence of which the dis<lb break="no"/>trict is to become a distinct number of the Uni<lb break="no"/>on; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be <lb/>added. For this sanction application is now made. <lb/>I shall cause the papers on this very important <lb/>transaction to be laid before you. The liberality <lb/>and harmony with which it has been conducted, <lb/>will be found to do great honour to both the par<lb break="no"/> <cb/>ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of <lb/>the Union and its present Government, expres<lb break="no"/>sed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke, cannot <lb/>fail to add an affectionate concern for their par<lb break="no"/>ticular welfare, to the great national impressions <lb/>under which you will declare on the case sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to you.</p>
                <p>"It has been heretofore known to Congress <lb/>that frequent incursions have been made on our <lb/>frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians <lb/>from the north west side of the Ohio. These, <lb/>with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the <lb/>Wabash, have of late been particularly active in <lb/>their depredations; and, being emboldened by <lb/>the impunity of their crimes, and aided by such <lb/>parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be se<lb break="no"/>duced to join in their hostilities, or afford them <lb/>a retreat for their prisoners, and plunder, they <lb/>have, instead of listening to the humane invitati<lb break="no"/>ons and overtures made on the part of the Unit<lb break="no"/>ed States, renewed their violence with fresh ala<lb break="no"/>crity and greater effect–The lives of a number of <lb/>valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed, and <lb/>some of them under circumstances peculiarly <lb/>shocking, whilst others have been carried into a <lb/>deplorable captivity.</p>
                <p>"These aggravated provocations rendered it es<lb break="no"/>sential to the safety of the western settlements, <lb/>that the aggressors should be made sensible that the <lb/>government of the Union is not less capable of <lb/>punishing their crimes, than it is disposed to <lb/>respect their rights and rewards their attachments. <lb/>As this object could not be effected by defensive <lb/>measures, it became necessary to put in force the <lb/>act which empowers the President to call out the <lb/>militia for the protection of the frontiers; and <lb/>I have accordingly authorised an expedition, in <lb/>which the regular troops in that quarter are com<lb break="no"/>bined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. <lb/>The event of the measure is yet unknown to me, <lb/>The Secretary at War is directed to lay before <lb/>you a statement of the information on which it <lb/>is founded, as well as an estimate of the expence <lb/>with which it will be attended.</p>
                <p>The disturbed situation of Europe, and parti<lb break="no"/>cularly the critical posture of the great maritime <lb/>powers, whilst it ought to make us more thank<lb break="no"/>ful for the general peace and security enjoyed by <lb/>the United States, reminds us at the same time <lb/>of the circumspection with which it becomes us <lb/>to preserve these blessings. It requires also that <lb/>we should not overlook the tendency of a war, <lb/>and even of preparations for war among the na<lb break="no"/>tions most concerned in active commerce with <lb/>this country, to abridge in means, and there <lb/>by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable <lb/>productions to their proper markets. I recom<lb break="no"/>mend it to your serious reflections, how far and <lb/>in what mode it may be expedient to guard a<lb break="no"/>gainst embarrassments from these contingencies, <lb/>by such encouragements to ur own navigation <lb/>as will render our commerce andagriculture less <lb/>dependant of foreign bottoms, which may fail us <lb/>in the moments most interesting to both of these <lb/>great objects. Our fisheries and the transporta<lb break="no"/>tion of our own produce, offers us abundant means <lb/>for guarding ourselves against this evil.</p>
                <p>"Your attention seems to be not less due to <lb/>that particular branch of our trade which belongs <lb/>to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances <lb/>unite in rendering the present state of it destres<lb break="no"/>ful to us, that you will not think any deliberations <lb/>misemployed which may lead to its relief and <lb/>protection.</p>
                <p>"The laws you have already passed for the esta<lb break="no"/>blishment of a judiciary system, have opened the <lb/>doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. <lb/>You will consider in your wisdom, whether im<lb break="no"/>provement of a judicatory system, have opened <lb/>the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. <lb/>Yu will consider in your wisdom, whether im<lb break="no"/><pb n="3"/> provements in that system may yet be made, and <lb/>particularly whether<supplied reason="copy blur">??? ???</supplied>process of exe<lb break="no"/>cution on sentences issuing from the Federal <lb/>Courts, be not desirable through all the States.</p>
                <p>"The patronage of our commerce, of our <lb/>merchants and seamen, has called for the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems <lb/>expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that <lb/>jurisdiction and those functions which are permit<lb break="no"/>ted them, either by express convention, or by a <lb/>friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. <lb/>The Consular Convention too, with his most <lb/>Christian Majesty, has stipulated in certain cases, <lb/>the aid of the National authority to his Consuls <lb/>established here. Some legislative provision is re<lb break="no"/>quisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.</p>
                <p>"The establishment of the Militia, of a Mint, <lb/>of Standards of Weights and Measures, of the <lb/>Post Office and Post Roads, are subjects which <lb/>(I presume) you will resume of course, and which <lb/>are abundantly urged by their own importance.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen of the House of Representatives</hi>, <lb/>"The sufficiency of the revenues you have es<lb break="no"/>tablished for the objects to which they are appro<lb break="no"/>priated, leaves no doubt that the residuary provi<lb break="no"/>sions will be commensurate to the other objects <lb/>for which the public faith stands now pledged. <lb/>Allow me moreover to hope, that it will be a <lb/>favourite policy with you, not merely to secure a <lb/>payment of the interest of the debt founded, but <lb/>as far and as fast as the growing resources of the <lb/>country will permit, to exonerate it of the prin<lb break="no"/>cipal itself. The appropriation you have made <lb/>of the western lands explain your dispositions on <lb/>this subject, and I am persuaded the sooner that <lb/>valuable fund can be made to contribute, along <lb/>with other means, to the actual reduction of the <lb/>public debt, the more salutary will the measure <lb/>be toe very public interest, as well as be more <lb/>satisfactory to our constituents.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen of the Senate, and House of Re<lb break="no"/>presentatives</hi>.</p>
                <p>"In perusing the various and weighty busi<lb break="no"/>ness of the present session, I indulge the fullest <lb/>persuasion that your consultations will be equally <lb/>marked with wisdom, and animated by the love <lb/>of your country. In whatever belongs to my <lb/>duty, you shall have all the co-operation which <lb/>an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It <lb/>will be happy for us both, and our best reward, <lb/>if by a successful administration of our respective <lb/>trusts, we can make the established government <lb/>more and more instrumental in promoting the <lb/>good of our fellow citizens, and more and more <lb/>the object of their attachment and confidence. <lb/><hi rend="center">(Signed) GEORGE WASHINGTON." </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">United States, Dec</hi>. 8 1790.</p>
