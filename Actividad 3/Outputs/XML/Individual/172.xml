                <p>(Extract of a Letter, <hi rend="italic">dated off Madeira</hi> ) <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Aurora Transport Ship, Feb 19.</hi></p>
                <p>"An opportunity having offered for transmitting <lb/>a hasty account of the Aurora and Brilliant transports, <lb/>proceeding with settlers to the Cape of Good Hope, I <lb/>feel happy in availing myself of that circumstance, <lb/>with a view as well to gratify our friends in England, <lb/>as to add another confirmation of the liberality of Go<lb break="no"/>vernment in our important undertaking. First, it will <lb/>be necessary to state, that the two ships sail in compa<lb break="no"/>ny, and are every day within hail of each other ; the <lb/>former commanded by Captain Pearson, and the latter <lb/>by Captain Bothwell, who is accompanied by Lieute<lb break="no"/>nant Pritchard, as agent to both vessels.</p>
                <p>"We sailed from Gravesend on. Our <lb/>course down Channel was most favourable, and the <lb/>weather has hitherto been propitious. No death, <lb/>disease, or serious accident has occurred in either ship <lb/>and blooming health and vigour now rapidly succeed the <lb/>langour produced by a sudden transition to a new ele<lb break="no"/>ment. Provisions, consisting of flour, currants, suet[?] <lb/>oatmeal, peas, butter, cheese, tea, sugar, biscuit, salt <lb/>pork, and beef, of excellent quality, are liberally sup<lb break="no"/>plied, together with a proper allowance of rum, vine<lb break="no"/>gar, mustard and spices. The ships are fitted up in <lb/>every respect comfortably and commodiously, and the <lb/>most perfect harmony prevails, if we except bickerings <lb/>amongst the old women about fractured teapots and <lb/>mislaid culinary articles. The attention paid to the <lb/>comfort of the passengers, and more especially to that <lb/>of the women and children, by the Captains, and the <lb/>agent (Mr Pritchard), is highly creditable to the in<lb break="no"/>structions received from Government.</p>
                <p>"Although I do not sail in the same ship Cap<lb break="no"/>tain Bothwell. I have had ample proofs of the kind<lb break="no"/>ness and humane liberality which he shews to the pas<lb break="no"/>sengers in the Brilliant. Captain Pearson is an active, <lb/>intelligent officer, who has been 23 years in the Tran<lb break="no"/>sport Service under Government : he has sailed to al<lb break="no"/>most every part of the world, and Algoa Bay, our <lb/>place of destination, is quite familiar to him.</p>
                <p>"It may be egotism to speak of myself; but I trust <lb/>I may be excused in boasting, that of the crew and <lb/>240 passengers, not one is seriously indisposed at present, <lb/>and wishing, with heartfelt sincerity, to my friends in <lb/>England, happiness, peace, and tranquility, in as good <lb/>health as I now enjoy, long may they live, long live the <lb/>Constitution: and while on Fish River or Orange Ri<lb break="no"/>ver we encounter the difficulties incident to new colo<lb break="no"/>nists, may England and South Africa be ever united <lb/>by the ties of mutual friendshipâ€“the one affording her <lb/>parental arms, and the other mindful of her filial duty. <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">P. Campbell</hi>., Surgeon.</p>
