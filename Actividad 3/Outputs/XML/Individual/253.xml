                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration.</hi> –It will be observed, from an adver<lb break="no"/>tisement in to-day's paper, that Government are fitting <lb/>another ship for the <hi rend="italic">free</hi>  conveyance of single females <lb/>from London to Van Dieman's Land ; and from the <lb/>great demand for agricultural labourers, and mecha<lb break="no"/>nics of every description, in that colony, it has been <lb/>resolved to grant a passage to that class, at a cost not <lb/>above what is paid to America–Government paying <lb/>the remainder of the sum as a bounty, amounting to <lb/>t30, which may certainly be looked upon as a great <lb/>boon, both by individuals and the colony at large. In <lb/>all the colonies there appears to be a scarcity of work<lb break="no"/>ing people, as from an official document in our posses<lb break="no"/>sion, it is asserted, on authority, that in Upper Canada <lb/>agricultural labourers, domestic servants, and trades<lb break="no"/>men of every description, will be for some years in <lb/>great request. Farm labourers readily obtain from <lb/>t25 to t30 per annum, with board, lodging, and <lb/>washing, and day-labourers from 3s. to 4s. per day, <lb/>with provisions. The government agent for emigra<lb break="no"/>tion for the Canadas asserts he could find imme<lb break="no"/>diate employment for 20,000 working people, as pub<lb break="no"/>lic improvements are much retarded for want of hands. <lb/>As this is the best season, we would advise all those <lb/>intending to emigrate to apply to the government <lb/>agent for emigration at the Custom House, Leith, <lb/>who will give gratuitous information regarding the <lb/>colonies, and advise as to the best method of putting <lb/>their plans into execution. The rate of wages for <lb/>every description of mechanics may be likewise seen <lb/>there.</p>
