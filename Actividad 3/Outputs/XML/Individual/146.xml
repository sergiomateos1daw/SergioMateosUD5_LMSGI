                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Letter from Mr Morris Birkbeck</hi></p>
                <p>"English Prairie, (Illinoia,) Nov.25. 1818.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>  – Your favour of 15th June is before me. <lb/>Presuming you retain a copy of the queries, I <lb/>proceed to answer then in order: – Respecting <lb/>domestic servants ; what may be the condition of <lb/>our colony in two years it is impossible to foresee, <lb/>but should it be in your power to bring with you <lb/>female domestics, it would be well to do so ; also <lb/>a carpenter or two and a few labourers ; if with <lb/>families, so much the better. Written engage<lb break="no"/>ments for a term, or indentures, are not binding, <lb/>unless renewed on this side of the Atlantic. I <lb/>have not seen any of these documents, and can <lb/>therefore give you no precise directions for them : <lb/>perhaps a simple engagement from the parties, <lb/>acknowledging as a debt the expence incurred <lb/>in bringing our, might be a sufficient security, <lb/>leaving their wages to be determined here ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the current rates, yet to be establish<lb break="no"/>ed by the proportion of supply to the demand, <lb/>which, as I remarked above, it is now impossible <lb/>to ascertain. As to the number of labourers, or <lb/>female domestics, you would need perhaps six of <lb/>the former and two of the latter would a safe <lb/>adventure, looking to the colony for an ad<lb break="no"/>dition, should you need it, after you are set<lb break="no"/>tled – before that you will find a greater num<lb break="no"/>ber an incumbrance : this is, I think, all I <lb/>can say to your first, third, fourth, and fifth <lb/>queries. All expence of transfer of your fami<lb break="no"/>ly and luggage, supposing the latter to weigh <lb/>ten thousand pounds, I should estimate under <lb/>L.1000 sterling. On this particular subject Mr R. Flower <lb/>would give you most particular information – <lb/>The luggage would cost about ten dollars per <lb/>100 lbs. So much for your query. To the se<lb break="no"/>venth query – I think L.200 would assist your <lb/>family in plenty for a year, exclusive of wages <lb/>and clothing. Eighth query – L.3000 would be <lb/>a good capital for a section, or 640 acres, and I <lb/>question your wishing to hold in cultivation a <lb/>larger tract. Ninth query – I consider our si<lb break="no"/>tuation not liable to future disturbance from In<lb break="no"/>dians, in the event of a war between Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain and the United States, being covered by in<lb break="no"/>creasing settlements to the west, north-west, and <lb/>north. Tenth query – The earthquakes men<lb break="no"/>tioned by Bradbury I have heard of from many <lb/>persons ; but I have not discovered that it has <lb/>left any impression on the public mind ; on this <lb/>score, for my own part, I feel no anxiety about <lb/>the matter ; Great Britain, I suppose, in propor<lb break="no"/>tion to its dimensions, is equally liable to earth<lb break="no"/>quakes. Elenventh query, – The route by New Or<lb break="no"/>leans will, I have no doubt, be preferable to that <lb/>by the eastern cities. When due precaution <lb/>against the diseases of the climate are observed, <lb/>I have never failed to recommend it. Twelfth <lb/>query – The health of my family has not suffered <lb/>from the climate. One of my sons has been <lb/>affected with ague. This summer has been <lb/>more sickly in these parts than any season for <lb/>seven years past, and has afforded me a most en<lb break="no"/>couraging confirmation of the temperature and <lb/>salubrity of our settlement, and has also afforded <lb/>immeasurable proofs of those facts regarding the <lb/>sufferings of new settlers, to which I have so <lb/>anxiously invited the attention of the readers of <lb/>my journal. On the whole, provided common <lb/>sense should be seconded by common industry, <lb/>in the inclosure and cultivation of our colony, I <lb/>think we shall not be visisted by more than our <lb/>due share of physical calamity. I deferred no<lb break="no"/>ticing your second query, the subject being con<lb break="no"/>nected with the proposal respecting land, at the <lb/>conclusion of your letter. I would strongly re<lb break="no"/>commend your deferring the purchase of land <lb/>until your arrival. It would be difficult to con<lb break="no"/>vey to you the reasons, but you would feel the <lb/>propriety of my advice, should you come. I <lb/>think you would have as good a choice two <lb/>years hence as now, because excellent siutations, <lb/>as yet unsurveyed, will then be on sale. I have <lb/>no eligible offer to make you beyond a section. <lb/>You inquire concerning venomous reptiles ; they <lb/>are no source of injury or alarm to us. Insects, <lb/>in new countries, often abound to an astonishing <lb/>degree, and are sufficiently teazing to man and <lb/>beast. Many species yield instantly to cultiva<lb break="no"/>tion, and are heard of no more as plagues ; <lb/>others will continue until conquered by order <lb/>and industry. The thermometer ranges from <lb/>13 below zero to 89 above ; the extremes are, of <lb/>course, of rare occurence, and short duration. <lb/>At Philadelphia, I understand, it rose this sum<lb break="no"/>mer 97, and in this neighbourhood, in the low <lb/>river bottoms, I believe it might reach that de<lb break="no"/>gree. On our praire I think it never reached <lb/>89. The smaller streams are rapid and soon <lb/>dry ; the larger sluggish in the extreme – cat<lb break="no"/>fish, perch, sturgeons abound, and many others <lb/>I believe. I think 1000 dollars would build a <lb/>comfortable plain dwelling. – Your obedient ser<lb break="no"/>vant, <hi rend="smallcaps">M. Birkbeck</hi>."</p>
