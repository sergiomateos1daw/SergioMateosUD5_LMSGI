                <p><pb/>Papers from Madras to the 17th of January have <lb/>been received. Accounts had arrived through Singa<lb break="no"/>pore, from the ship Mangles, stating that when pass<lb break="no"/>ing through Torres Straits she touched at Murray's <lb/>Island, where they discovered eight Europeans, part <lb/>of the crew of the long-missing bark, Charles Eaton, <lb/>in a state of slavery, but the natives would not deliver <lb/>up the men. The Charles Eaton was supposed to <lb/>have been lost on the Barrier Reef, in Torres Straits, <lb/>in 1833, in prosecution of her voyage from New South <lb/>Wales to Madras, but no precise intelligence of her <lb/>fate was previously known. The ironworks which <lb/>had been erected at Porto Novo were proceeding with <lb/>activity, and some railing had been made there, quite <lb/>equal, it is stated to anything og the kind manufac<lb break="no"/>tured in England.</p>
