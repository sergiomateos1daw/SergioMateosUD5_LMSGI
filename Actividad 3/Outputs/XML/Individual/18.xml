                <p><pb/><hi rend="italic">A short</hi>  DESCRIPTION <hi rend="italic">of, and</hi>  REMARKS <hi rend="italic">upon </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">a new State called</hi>  THE WESTERN TERRITORY, <lb/><hi rend="italic">being one of four settled by the Americans since </hi><lb/>1774.</p>
                <p><hi rend="enlarged-capital">T</hi> HAT no nation can serve the Americans <lb/>with goods equal in quality and price to <lb/>Britain, is wha the whole world knows, and from <lb/>experience the most obstinate rebel American dare <lb/>not deny: It is with pleasure, therefore, we inform <lb/>our readers, that the United States are paying <lb/>more attention to agriculture than to manufac<lb break="no"/>tures–They have already laid out four new <lb/>States since the beginning of their rebellion, viz. <lb/><hi rend="italic">Vermont, Kentucky, Indiana,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">The Western Ter<lb break="no"/>ritory.</hi></p>
                <p>About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wil<lb break="no"/>derness; they only began to settle it about the <lb/>year 1774. Kentucky, ten years ago lay in fo<lb break="no"/>rest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid <lb/>has been the population, that there are not less <lb/>than one hundred thousand inhabitants, already, <lb/>in each of these states. The State of Indiana <lb/>was only laid off this present year in 1789, and con<lb break="no"/>tains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From <lb/>a description of these four States, published in <lb/>America in May last, we give our readers a <lb/>short abridged description of the last of them, <lb/>called <hi rend="italic">The Western Territory</hi> ; and it must re<lb break="no"/>rejoice the heart of every Briton to read it, and <lb/>think, that the settling of these countries, though <lb/>the Americans double their numbers every 15 or <lb/>20 years, will long keep them from manufactur<lb break="no"/>ing, and is every day opening a field for new cus<lb break="no"/>tomers to Great Britain; for who will work as a <lb/>tradesman, even though wages are very high, <lb/>when he can, for twenty pounds, purchase a thou<lb break="no"/>sand acres of land, that being the present price <lb/>fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western <lb/>Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufac<lb break="no"/>tures will continually increase with the increasing <lb/>population of America.–Desponding politicians <lb/>may derive comfort from the prospect, that new <lb/>channels of commerce will be opened, and the in<lb break="no"/>land parts of the Continent will require an increas<lb break="no"/>ing supply.–British manufactures will for ages <lb/>ascend the great rivers of that Continent, and by <lb/>means of a most extraordinary inland navigation, <lb/>will be diffused through a country more fertile, <lb/>more extensive, than all the Thirteen United <lb/>States.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">The Western Territory</hi></hi> <lb/>Is the name given to this new State by Congress. <lb/>It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river <lb/>–north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania? <lb/>south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains, <lb/>according to Mr. Hutchins, Geographer General <lb/>to the Congress, 411,000 square miles, equal to <lb/>two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres, <lb/>from which he deducts forth-three millions of <lb/>acres for water; there will then remain two hun<lb break="no"/>dred and twenty millions of acres belonging to <lb/>the fed–ral government, which is to be sold for <lb/>the discharge of the debt owing to the United <lb/>States. But a very small proportion of these <cb/>lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and <lb/>disposed of by Congress*.</p>
                <p>On the lands which have been purchased by <lb/>Congress from the Indians two settlements are <lb/>already commenced–one at Marietta, the other <lb/>at Miami.</p>
                <p>This State was only laid out by Congress in <lb/>the end of the year 1787, and already contains <lb/>above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are <lb/>the Mississippi, Ohio, Muskingham, Hockhock<lb break="no"/>ing, Sioto, Miami, Wobash,&amp;c–Coal and iron <lb/>mines, and salt pits, abound in this State; the <lb/>soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined, and <lb/>may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little <lb/>or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy, pleasant, <lb/>and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth <lb/>known to the Europeans or Americans–exceed<lb break="no"/>ing the soil of any of the United States. The <lb/>timber is tall, and in great variety?Streams for <lb/>mills abound here. Wheat, indigo, hemp, and <lb/>cotton, thrive well. Many years will probably <lb/>not escape before a good part of the country will <lb/>be brought to that degree of cultivation that will <lb/>exhibit all its latent beauties, and fulfill the de<lb break="no"/>scription of travellers, who call it the <hi rend="italic">garden of </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">the world.</hi>  It is here probably also that the center <lb/>of a great empire will be fixed in some future pe<lb break="no"/>riod. It is the most centrical place for Congress <lb/>to accommodate themselves at. No country is <lb/>better stocked with wild game of every kind; <lb/>herds of deers, elks, bears, &amp;c fill the extensive <lb/>meadows of thie country?turkies, geese, swans, <lb/>and partridges, &amp;c. are innumerable. The rivers <lb/>are excellently stored with fish, and almost all na<lb break="no"/>vigable for small sloops.</p>
                <p>In the ordinance published by Congress for <lb/>the government of this territory, they are to <lb/>be allowed an Assembly when their number a<lb break="no"/>mounts to 30,000 persons; and when they ac<lb break="no"/>quire a certain degree of population they are to <lb/>have representatives in Congress; and when fifty <lb/>millions of acres are settled they are to be divided <lb/>into States.</p>
                <p>Rejoice, O Britons! that they must all be sup<lb break="no"/>plied with manufactures by you, and you <hi rend="italic">only!</hi></p>
                <p>* No more than about twelve millions of acres have <lb/>yet been purchased of the poor natives, for which Con<lb break="no"/>gress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods <lb/>and rum.</p>
