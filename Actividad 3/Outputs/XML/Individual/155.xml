                <p>Letters and papers have been received from Jamaica <lb/>to the 5 ult. We are sorry to observe, that the let<lb break="no"/>lets from thence state that the island was very unheal<lb break="no"/>thy. The deaths from the fever were[?] very[?] considerable, <lb/>and were increasing. The garrison had been particu<lb break="no"/>larly unhealthy.</p>
                <p>The [?]th and 92d regiments have suffered severely <lb/>by the [?] of the climate and are reduced to <lb/>mere skeletons. We [?] [?] the [?] of several <lb/>officers [?] [?] [?] to it ; causing them [?] <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>several others.</p>
                <p>A serious dispute exists between the Governor of <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>a general [?] [?] [?] <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>[?] [?] [?]</p>
                <p><pb/>[?] of the [?]. His Lordship has been support-[?] <lb/>ed by counter meetings of the inhabitants, who com<lb break="no"/>plain of the licentiousness of the press of the island.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(From the Port Royal Gazette of the 28th August) </hi><lb/>"Private letters from Panama state, that Lord Co<lb break="no"/>chran had taken Petit Callao[?], in which port a vessel <lb/>was at anchor, having on board 100,000 dollars. It was <lb/>further said that his Lordship has passed Guayaquil <lb/>oh his way to Chili. Almost a forthnight ago, intelli<lb break="no"/>gence reached the Governor of Carthagena, from Santa <lb/>Fe, that General Bolivar, who had been joined by one <lb/>of Murillo's Generals, with a number of troops, was <lb/>making rapid advances towards Santa Fe with upwards <lb/>of 5000 men ; and it was expected the next courier <lb/>would announce[?] the fall of that place. An Aide-de<lb break="no"/>Camp of the Governor of that place arrived at Car<lb break="no"/>thagena at midnight with the above information. A<lb break="no"/>nother account states, that the Venezuelian army, un<lb break="no"/>der General Bolivar in person, had obtained posses<lb break="no"/>sion of Santa Fe, and that his advanced guard was at <lb/>Honda[?] ; he had succeeded in cutting off the retreat of <lb/>General Samana[?], the Captain-General of Santa Fe ; <lb/>his Secretary, Ramirez, has arrived at Carthagena with <lb/>the above intelligence ; it was also added that a part <lb/>of Bolivar's army would soon be in Mempaz[?].</p>
                <p>There have arrived at the port of Quebec, this pre<lb break="no"/>sent season 9,513 settlers.</p>
                <p>A letter from Demerara of the 14th August says <lb/>that a severe shock of an earthquake had been felt in <lb/>that colony for the first time since the memory of man[?]. <lb/>It occurred on the 12th. and continued for 30 se<lb break="no"/>cond[?].</p>
                <p>"Madras, April 14. <lb/>"The gratifying intelligence of the fall of Asser<lb break="no"/>ghur reached the Presidency yesterday. We wait with <lb/>impatience for the official details.</p>
                <p>"Madras, April 17. <lb/>It is with since regret that we announce the death <lb/>of John Duncan, Esq. third Member of the Medical <lb/>Board at this Presidency, at General Lang's gardens. <lb/>On Saturday last, the 10th instant. The funeral took <lb/>place on Sunday evening, with the honours due to his <lb/>rank ; and is remains were attended to the place of <lb/>internment by a numerous assemblage of his friends at <lb/>the Presidency. Mr Duncan's valuable services were <lb/>for mroe than 30 years devoted to the benefit of the <lb/>public, and the relief of suffering humanity[?] ; and dur<lb break="no"/>ing the whole of that period, it may be truly said, that <lb/>he always evinced a firm, humane[?], and honourable dis<lb break="no"/>position, the remembrance of which must render his <lb/>memory universally respected.</p>
                <p>"Calcutta, March 24. <lb/>"A Treaty has been concluded by the Hon. Sir <lb/>Stamford Raffles[?], on the part of the Most Noble the <lb/>Governor-General, with the Sultan of Jahore and To<lb break="no"/>mangong of Sincapore, establishing a British Residen<lb break="no"/>cy at the latter place, under Major Furqubar, with a <lb/>settlement on the ruins of the ancient captial of that <lb/>country, over which, we may congratulate our readers, <lb/>that the British flag is now flying ; Sir S. Raffles hav<lb break="no"/>ing returned from this expedition to Penang[?] on the <lb/>4th of last month. The grant of this island, which is <lb/>situated at the southern extremity of the Peninsula of <lb/>Malacca[?] must become valuable to the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, especially when accompanied, as we understand <lb/>that it is, with the privilege of establishing further set<lb break="no"/>tlements along the extensive coast of Jahore, which <lb/>must afford considerable protection to our commerce <lb/>in that quarter, particularly to ships passing through <lb/>the Straits, and enable us to watch the proceedings of <lb/>our Bataxian competitors.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cape Town Gazettes</hi>  to the 1st of August have come <lb/>to our hands. At the present moment, when plans for <lb/>colonising the territory adjoining the Cape of Good <lb/>Hope, occupy so much attention, we turn to these pa<lb break="no"/>pers with peculiar anxiety. They, however, contain <lb/>little notice of public events at the Cape ; and nothing <lb/>whatever is said of the incursions of the Caffres. We <lb/>collect incidentally, that the scarcity which lately pre<lb break="no"/>vailed at the Cape has entirely ceased ; ample supplies <lb/>of wheat and flour having lately been imported or <lb/>brought to market.</p>
                <p>Maritime Intelligence</p>
                <p>Friday, a Court Martial was assembled on board the <lb/>Queen Charlotte, in Portsmouth harbour, and con<lb break="no"/>tinued by adjournment during Saturday, to inquire into <lb/>the circumstances of the supposed concealment of two <lb/>deserters from the band of the 18th regiment of foot <lb/>on board his Majesty's ships Phaeton[?], Captain W. H. <lb/>Dillon, in the month of October last, when that ship <lb/>was about to proceed to the East Indies; and to try <lb/>Lieutenant John Geary, the first Lieutenant of the said <lb/>ship, for his conduct upon that occasion. The Court[?] <lb/>was crowded with officers, &amp;c. from the shore each <lb/>day. The prosecution was closed on Saturday after<lb break="no"/>nnoon, and the Court adjourned till ten o'clock on Mon<lb break="no"/> <lb/>day, when Lieutenant Geary made his defence. The <lb/>Court having considered the whole of the evidence, were <lb/>of opinion that the charge was proved, and sentenced <lb/>him to be dismissed his Majesty's ship Phaeton, and <lb/>severely reprimanded.</p>
                <p>Letters from Port Jackson, New South Wales, dated <lb/>March 30th, were receivedon Sunday. The ships Sur<lb break="no"/>rey and Lord Sidmouth, with convicts from England, <lb/>arrived on the 4th and 11th March. A schooner of <lb/>80 tons burden, intended for the Chief of the Society <lb/>Islands, was to be launched on the 7th of April. The <lb/>Shipley, with dispatches and troops on board, was to <lb/>sail on the first, and may, therefore, be expected daily <lb/>in this country.</p>
