                <pb n="3"/><head><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to America</hi></head>
                <p>Our paper of Thursday last contained a gene<lb break="no"/>ral view of some of the most popular publications <lb/>on the subject of emigration, and we shall now <lb/>endeavour briefly to make an estimate of the <lb/>good and evil which is likely to befall those who <lb/>embark in this hazardous adventure.</p>
                <p>There is one important fact which we gather <lb/>from all the accounts of America, whether writ<lb break="no"/>ten for the purpose of praise or censure, namely, <lb/>that there is a great demand for labour, and that <lb/>wages are high, and this effect is necessarily <lb/>produced y the vast space of fertile and unoc<lb break="no"/>cupied territory which lies westward of the <lb/>United States towards the Pacific Ocean. It is <lb/>this vacant territory which is the true spring of <lb/>this American community. Here is the grand out<lb break="no"/>let for the superflouous population both of the east<lb break="no"/>ern states of America and of Europe. To cultivate <lb/>this waste there is a constant demand for new la<lb break="no"/>bourers ; wages are, of course, high – the labourer <lb/>lives in comfort, and, if he is industrious, he be<lb break="no"/>comes in his turn a purchaser of land from the sa<lb break="no"/>vings which he accumulates. If labour should be<lb break="no"/>come more plentiful, and wages should fall, this is <lb/>the signal for new emigrations ; and thus, this con<lb break="no"/>stant demand for labour in the western districts <lb/>regulates its general price throughout the United <lb/>States. In these circumstrances it is clear that <lb/>a labourer, provided he can reach this advan<lb break="no"/>tageous market for his labour, will unquestionably <lb/>improve his condition. But herein lies the dif<lb break="no"/>ficulty. A labourer has seldom the means of <lb/>of subsistence so far beforehand as to enable him to <lb/>undertake so long a journey ; and, if he enters <lb/>upon the enterprise with insufficient means, he <lb/>is liable to starve before he can transport him<lb break="no"/>self to his ultimate destination, or he is forced to <lb/>contract, for immediate subsistence, obligations <lb/>little short of servitude, under the weight of <lb/>which he is grievously oppressed. These, then <lb/>form strong objections to emigrations in the case <lb/>of those who are stinted to their means ; but <lb/>where these objections can be surmounted, those <lb/>who can transport their labour from the over<lb break="no"/>stocked market of Europe to the understocked <lb/>market of America, will unquestionably dispose <lb/>of it to better advantage ; but if they have not <lb/>the means, they may as furely fail in the at<lb break="no"/>tempt, and draw upon themselves aggravated mi<lb break="no"/>sery and want. As to the consequences of emi<lb break="no"/>gration to this country, we hold them rather to be <lb/>beneficial than otherwise, and we cannot easily ac<lb break="no"/>count for the very absurd alarm which has been <lb/>propagated on this subject. The evil in Europe is, <lb/>that every country is overcrowded with labourers, <lb/>who cannot find employment ; and is it not mani<lb break="no"/>fest, therefore, that the withdrawing of some of <lb/>these will make more room for the labourers that <lb/>remain – that the loss of those useless hands <lb/>will rather be a relief to the body politic, and <lb/>will diffuse greater soundness and vigour through <lb/>all its parts? That these effects will follow from <lb/>emigration in this or in any other country in <lb/>Europe we cannot doubt – and that the labourer, <lb/>if he can afford the expence of the journey, will re<lb break="no"/>ceive higher wages in America than in this coun<lb break="no"/>try, is equally clear.</p>
                <p>There is another class of adventurers who <lb/>may possibly improve their circumstances by <lb/>emigration, although this is not so certain, name<lb break="no"/>ly, farmers with a moderate capital. An allot<lb break="no"/>ment of land may be purchased in the back parts <lb/>of America at the Government price of two dol<lb break="no"/>lars per acre, and an emigrant who can afford to <lb/>but and to cultivate 100 or 200 acres, and <lb/>acts with proper judgement and skill, may <lb/>undoubtedly, by a speculation of this sort, be sure <lb/>of a subsistence, while, by the continued emigra<lb break="no"/>tions from the eastern states, the country being <lb/>quickly settled all around him, his property is <lb/>daily improving in value. But a want of judgement <lb/>in the purchase, or a want of ability to cultivate the <lb/>land after it is purchased, may involve him in ir<lb break="no"/>recoverable distress and ruin ; and to avoid these <lb/>hazards no little discrimination and prudence is <lb/>necessary.</p>
                <p>Such are some of the most striking advantages <lb/>of emigration, and we shall now state some of <lb/>its disadvantages. The first, and chief of these, <lb/>is the difficulty of effecting a settlement, and of <lb/>subsisting until the land which is purchased yields <lb/>its first produce. The country is partly open <lb/>ground, or prairie, as it is called, or it is co<lb break="no"/>vered with almost boundless forests. A settle<lb break="no"/>ment in the woods requires incredible labour to <lb/>clear it – labour is dear, and not easily procured, <lb/>and this herculean task naturally devolves on the <lb/>head of the family, who is forced during the day <lb/>to ply the axe in this laborious drudgery of fell<lb break="no"/>ing trees, and afterwards to follow the chace for <lb/>a meal to his family. Here he must frequently <lb/>sleep out in the woods ; and his body, exhausted <lb/>with his day's labour, is exposed to the cold <lb/>dews of night ; under such unintermitted toil his <lb/>health declines, and it is obvious that his family, <lb/>deprived even for a single day of his exertions, <lb/>must be reduced to the most deplorable straits. <lb/>In many parts the country which is marked out <lb/>for emigrants is extremely unhealthy, in particu<lb break="no"/>lar the banks of all the navigable rivers, which <lb/>afford the most eligible settlements both in point <lb/>of fertility and situation, are exposed to the most <lb/>fatal maladies. The same causes which produce <lb/>fertility produce disease. The overflowing of <lb/>the waters, from the autumnal and spring floods, <lb/>fertilise the land in a most wonderful degree ; <lb/>but the exhalations of these stagnant waters, un<lb break="no"/>der a burning sun, are as fatal to the health as <lb/>the deposits which they leave are favourable to <lb/>the soil. Hence the many minute directions <lb/>which are given to all emigrants in regard to <lb/>their health. In a letter contained in the Emi<lb break="no"/>grant's Guide, we have the following advice to <lb/>those who are descending the Ohio : " If the <lb/>weather becomes warm, guard well against the <lb/>smell of bilge water. But if you must descend in <lb/>the spring, go early – avoid all delay, and remem<lb break="no"/>ber you are fleeing for your lives. I have seen the <lb/>havoc, and I believed it not till then." Again it <lb/>is observed, " Let nothing tempt you to fish in <lb/>warm weather, immediately on changing your <lb/>climate. The effluvia of the shores is poison." <lb/>To a European emigran the climate must be, of <lb/>course, even more fatal ; and he either therefore <lb/>lose his health, or he must be continually <lb/>tormented with anxiously taking care of it, which <lb/>makes it a question whether it is worth having on <lb/>such terms. Such are the hardships through which, <lb/>if he has strength to endure them, he at length <lb/>emerges into ease and independence. These hard<lb break="no"/>ships, however, will no doubt be in a great mea<lb break="no"/>sure avoided, or at least mitigated, if he has be<lb break="no"/>forehand provided the means of subsistence until <lb/>he can derive regular supplies from his own <lb/>land. In this case he is less liable to be <lb/>dislodged from his situation by the casualties to <lb/>which all emigrants are necessarily exposed. – <lb/>He is secured against the hardships of a first <lb/>settlement, and is more certain of attaining <cb/>the wished for object of ease and affluence – <lb/>To a farmer, therefore, or a labourer, emigra<lb break="no"/>tion presents a fair chance of a permanent settle<lb break="no"/>ment, provided it is gone about with ordinary <lb/>caution, and the necessary degree of energy be <lb/>exerted to insure success. But it is a gross de<lb break="no"/>lusion to imagine that an elysium is to be found in <lb/>the United States, or that mankind exist there on <lb/>any more favourable terms than in this country, <lb/>and those who set out on any such visionary <lb/>schemes are sure to meet with a woeful disappoint<lb break="no"/>ment. With regard to other classes of society, it <lb/>does not appear that they will improve their con<lb break="no"/>dition by emigration to America ; there is no de<lb break="no"/>mand for clerks or professional men of any sort, <lb/>and no merchant has any thing to expect by remo<lb break="no"/>ving his capital to the United States. In the back <lb/>settlements there is a demand for schoolmasters <lb/>to teach the ordinary branches of education, and <lb/>several emigrants of this class have met with <lb/>good encouragement.</p>
                <p>In regard to the essential article of comfort, it <lb/>is apparent, from all the best information on the <lb/>subject, that a person long resident in this coun<lb break="no"/>try would change for the worse by an emigra<lb break="no"/>tion to the United States. He would, in the <lb/>first place, suffer extremely from the climate, from <lb/>the extreme cold of winter and the raging heat <lb/>of summer, the thermometer frequently standing <lb/>at 98 degrees in the share, with a clear sky and <lb/>broiling sun, and very little abatement of this ex<lb break="no"/>sessive heat being experienced through the night. <lb/>His frame, accustomed to the more temperate, <lb/>though unsettled climate of this country, <lb/>runs the risk of being debilitated by the change, <lb/>and at all events he must suffer extremely in <lb/>his enjoyments and in his spirit from this <lb/>cause. Nor, we should imagine, would the man<lb break="no"/>ners of the people in the back parts be found <lb/>very agreeable or polished. It is admitted on all <lb/>hands, both by those who are favourable and <lb/>those who are unfavourable to the Americans, <lb/>that if there is not, as in Europe, gross igno<lb break="no"/>rance and debasement on the one hand, neither <lb/>is there on the other any thing much exalted <lb/>above the ordinary level. But the inferences <lb/>which arise from this established fact are strongly <lb/>in favour of Europe. The grossness of vice and <lb/>ignorance carries a sure antidote to its corrup<lb break="no"/>tions in the disgust which it excites : such <lb/>examples are not so potent to debase, as ex<lb break="no"/>amples of a different sort are to purify and <lb/>exalt. There is little risk that society will <lb/>be contaminated by what is low and deba<lb break="no"/>sed ; but on the other hand, there is a cer<lb break="no"/>tainty that what is exalted and illustrious in li<lb break="no"/>terature, science, taste, accomplishments, or <lb/>fashion, will exercise a powerful influence on <lb/>the general state of manners. We naturally <lb/>copy what we admire, and those great and shin<lb break="no"/>ing examples constitute a standard to which <lb/>the whole system of life and manners has a <lb/>tacit reference. In the United States they have <lb/>no such models – they do not aim at so high a <lb/>standard, and taste and manners are therefore <lb/>necessarily at a lower ebb than in Europe – <lb/>Hence all accounts agree in reprobating the ex<lb break="no"/>treme filthy habits which universally prevail ; and <lb/>Cobbett, who will be suspected of too great <lb/>partiality to this country, draws a contrast be<lb break="no"/>tween the inhabitants of Hampshire and those of <lb/>the United States, in which he places this vice <lb/>of the American manners in strong colours ; and <lb/>he adds, as his reason for this, that they have <lb/>no gentlemen's seats, with the fine improvements <lb/>of pleasure grounds, &amp;c. dispersed through the <lb/>country, as models of taste and neatness for the <lb/>inferior classes, and it is to the same principles that <lb/>we may trace other defects in their manners, <lb/>namely, that they have no proper models on which <lb/>to form themselves. Hence, excepting in the <lb/>principal cities, we may safely conclude, from all <lb/>the information we have received on the subject, <lb/>that society has not reach the same degree of <lb/>refinement as in this country.</p>
                <p>An emigrant accustomed to live in Britain <lb/>would also feel the disavantages of Ameri<lb break="no"/>can society strong in this, that here, in so <lb/>closely peopled a community, surrounded with <lb/>all sorts of refinements, life is assisted by such <lb/>a variety of helps, that it glides down the <lb/>smooth stream of comfort and convenience, with<lb break="no"/>out ever meeting with a single interruption. It <lb/>is astonishing to what a pitch of improvement a <lb/>society is brough, abounding in wealth and in all <lb/>the mechanical arts, and where the ingenuity of <lb/>thousands is incessantly on the rack to set on <lb/>foot new devices for the common good. We <lb/>are not duly sensible of the advantages of this, <lb/>because, like other advantages, they are familiar <lb/>to us by long habit, and we begin to imagine <lb/>that they are inherent in the natural constitution <lb/>of things. But when we are suddenly trans<lb break="no"/>planted into a new community, abounding in<lb break="no"/>deed in subsistence, but deficient in all com<lb break="no"/>forts – where only the coarsest mechanic arts are <lb/>practised – where the inhabitants are so wide<lb break="no"/>ly dispersed, that their common exertions <lb/>cannot be made available for the common <lb/>good, we find life interrupted at every turn. In <lb/>our former society, if we had not the previous <lb/>secret of transmuting all things into gold, we <lb/>had at least the power of transmuting gold into <lb/>every thing else. But here the power of money <lb/>is limited. We must indeed pay for services, <lb/>but we must also beg for them ; and thus we go <lb/>on fretting and tormenting ourselves under petty <lb/>incommodities, which in this country would be <lb/>remedied as soon as they were felt. It is incon<lb break="no"/> <lb/>ceivable how much inconvenience and discom<lb break="no"/>fort and real unhappiness may spring from this <lb/>cause. In this country, by long habit and prac<lb break="no"/>rice and continual improvement, every thing has <lb/>fallen into its right place – each individual has a <lb/>separate task assigned him in the joint task of <lb/>labouring for the general benefit – and the in<lb break="no"/>dustry of all, however variously directed, tends <lb/>to one common end. There is a perfect unity <lb/>of effort. We all labour in common – we com<lb break="no"/>bine our efforts that they may yield the largest <lb/>possible produce, and this produce is accurately <lb/>shared among the various members of the com<lb break="no"/>munity, each receiving the share to which his <lb/>labour entitles him. Such is substantially the <lb/>process by which commerce diffuses the benefits <lb/>of industry over every civilized community. – <lb/>Money is the instrument by which this division <lb/>is effected. Every one who labours has the value <lb/>of his labour ascertained in money, which is a <lb/>draft upon the common stock for whatever quan<lb break="no"/>tity of necessaries and luxuries he is entitled to ; <lb/>and all these complicated operations are execut<lb break="no"/>ed with a regularity almost mechanical. But in <lb/>a community newly forming there is a want of <lb/>unity and combination – all the members labour <lb/>indeed, but no one has his proper part assigned <lb/>him – there is a jostling and an interference with <lb/>each other – and when they come to divide, <lb/>some have too much, and some too little, of cer<lb break="no"/>tain articles – the stock is ill assorted, and money <cb/>will not execute its functions. Hence disorder <lb/>arises, and inconvience and awkward wants, <lb/>and an individual suddenly removed into this <lb/>region of discomfort from the happier climate of <lb/>a highly improved community, must be annoy<lb break="no"/>ed with feeling in the highest degree gloomy <lb/>and disagreeable. He must have the same sen<lb break="no"/>sation as a person who quits an elegant mansion, <lb/>fitted up with every comfort and convenience, <lb/>for one of inferior quality and coarsely finished, <lb/>where he is exposed to a thousand annoyances <lb/>every minute. It is observed by Dr Johnson, <lb/>that the evil of life does not consist in any sud<lb break="no"/>den and overwhelming crash of misery, but in a <lb/>series of petty discomforts amd mischiefs conti<lb break="no"/>nually preying upon the temper. The truth of <lb/>this maxim, those who emigrate from this coun<lb break="no"/>try to the back woods of America, will have a <lb/>good opportunity of verifying.</p>
                <p>The prevalence of slavery in most of the States <lb/>of the Union constitutes another capital defect <lb/>in the structure of American society. These <lb/>slaves form a degraded and oppressed class, and, <lb/>in the tyranny exercised over them, they them<lb break="no"/>selves are morally destroyed, while the corruption <lb/>extends to the other orders of society, equally <lb/>infecting the oppressed and the oppressor, and <lb/>debasing the general character and habits of the <lb/>people. It is vain to talk of liberty while <lb/>stain of tyranny so deeply infects the do<lb break="no"/>mestic manners of a community. There can <lb/>be no rational liberty unless we call that <lb/>liberty which gives us the privilege of tortu<lb break="no"/>ring and oppressing our fellow creatures. To <lb/>give an idea of the consequences of this dread<lb break="no"/>ful evil of slavery, we may state, that it is a <lb/>practice in Kentucky to commit delinquent slaves <lb/>into the hands of the public executioner, by <lb/>whom they are unmercifully flogged at the mar<lb break="no"/>key cross of the different towns, the streets <lb/>being filled with their pietous cries. What <lb/>can we think of the people where such spec<lb break="no"/>tacles are for a moment tolerated. This is so <lb/>utterly revolting to every just and enlightened <lb/>feeling, that to a European it would form a strong <lb/>objection to his permanent residence in that <lb/>country. In all the northern states, and in some <lb/>of the new states, particularly that of the <lb/>Ohio, slavery is indeed abolished. But in se<lb break="no"/>veral others the black form a large proportion <lb/>of the population, and they are not decreasing. <lb/>We know indeed that this evil is admitted in <lb/>its full extent by all the American statesmen, <lb/>that they lament it, but do not well see what <lb/>measures can be adopted to check it. The im<lb break="no"/>portation of new slaves is indeed prohibited, but <lb/>the increase of those already in the country <lb/>is the great grievance, against which it is <lb/>difficult to devise a remedy, and the cruel and <lb/>oppressive treatment which slaves will always <lb/>meet with wherever they exist, must tend <lb/>to degrade the habits and moral feelings of the <lb/>community at large. To such, therefore, as are <lb/>accustomed to European society, where no such <lb/>strain of tyranny infects the domestic manners, <lb/>an exchange into a community where his feel<lb break="no"/>ings may be revolted by spectacles of gross cruel<lb break="no"/>ty cannot be regarded as very desirable. If more <lb/>imperious considerations permit, they have cer<lb break="no"/>tainly a greater chance for happiness by remain<lb break="no"/>ing where the rights of nature are respected, than <lb/>by removing to a society where every principle <lb/>of humanity is trampled upon.</p>
