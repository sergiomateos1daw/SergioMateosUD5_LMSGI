                <p>By recent intelligence from Kentucky we learn <lb/>that a short time ago an American vessel was seiz<lb break="no"/>ed at New Orleans, and her cargo disposed of <lb/>by the Spaniards. Also, that the troop which <lb/>went out against the Indians had, not far from <lb/>the banks of the Ohio, fallen in with about for<lb break="no"/>ty of them, whom they made their prisoners, af<lb break="no"/>ter a slight resistance; and that having washed <lb/>them, 15 turned out to be white men.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Philadelphia, Nov</hi>  9.</hi></p>
                <p>We hear from undoubted authority, that a con<lb break="no"/>siderable loan has been negotiated in Holland for <lb/>the service of these United States.</p>

                <p>The Legislature of Vermont have resolved to <lb/>pay to the State of New York 30,000 dollars, <lb/>agreeably to the first proposition contained in the <lb/>declaration of the Commissioners of this State, ap<lb break="no"/>pointed to declare the consent of the Legislature <lb/>thereof, that a certain territory within the juris<lb break="no"/>diction of the State of New York be erected into <lb/>a new State on the 17th of October last; in con<lb break="no"/>sequnece whereof, all rights and titles to lands <lb/>within the State of Vermont, under grants of the <lb/>late colony of New York, or from the State of <lb/>New York (except such grants as were intended <lb/>as confirmations of those from New Hampshire) <lb/>cease and determine. The Legislature have also <lb/>resolved, that a Convention be called for taking <lb/>into consideration the constitution of the United <lb/>States; the members to be elected in December, <lb/>and the Convention to Meet the first week in Ja<lb break="no"/>uary. The Legislature have adjourned to meet <lb/>again on the first Thursday in January, for the <lb/>purpose (we suppose) of choosing Senators, and <lb/>affixing the time and manner of electing Repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives for Congress.</p>

                <p>The following resolution has passed the House <lb/>of Representatives of the State of Virginia now in <lb/>session: Resolved, That so much of this act, en<lb break="no"/>titled, "An Act, making provision for the provision for the debt <lb/>of the United States in their redemption of the <lb/>public debt, is dangerous to the rights, and sub<lb break="no"/>versive of the interest of the people; and demands <lb/>the marked disapprobation of the General Assem<lb break="no"/>bly."</p>

                <p>The stone work of the light house, at the en<lb break="no"/>trance of our harbour, is now completed. On <lb/>Tuesday the 9th instant, the last stone was laid <lb/>by Mr. Nichols, of this town, master builder. <lb/>The work is extremely well executed. The light<lb break="no"/>house is now 70 feet high. To this the lanthorn, <lb/>which is to be six feet in diameter, will add about <lb/>15 feet, 85 feet in whole. The lanthorn is <lb/>now preparing, and will probably be raised and <lb/>lighted by the first of next month.</p>

                <p>A society of respectable gentlemen of this place <lb/>have raised an adequate fund for the establishment <lb/>of an extensive manufacture of gunpowder, and <lb/>the necessary mill-works will be speedily erected <lb/>in the vicinity of this town. This important in<lb break="no"/>situation will not only prove highly advantageous <lb/>to this State and town, but may, if properly en<lb break="no"/>couraged, become a national benefit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">York (Pennsylvania), Nov</hi>  10. </hi><lb/>From Wright's Ferry we learn, that about <lb/>four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, as a boat <lb/>was coming from the East side, a most tremen<lb break="no"/>dous storm arose when she was about half way o<lb break="no"/>ver, by which means she was soon filled <lb/>with water, and sunk. there was six passengers <lb/>and the<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> in her (besides a small light <cb/>waggon and three horses, viz. a clergyman, the <lb/>owner of the waggon, with his wife and three <lb/>children; when the storm came on, the woman <lb/>and children took shelter in the waggon, but it <lb/>continued to blow with such violence that the <lb/>waggon was torn out of the boat, and the body <lb/>having by chance got loose from the carriage, <lb/>and being pretty tight, floated some distance <lb/>till its progress was stopped by a rock; the hus<lb break="no"/>band, viewing the melancholy situations of his <lb/>wife and children, resolved to relieve or perish <lb/>with them, and quitting the boat swam to the <lb/>waggon, cut open the cover with his knife, and <lb/>with difficulty kept their heads above water till <lb/>they were relieved by a boat from the West side; <lb/>by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappear<lb break="no"/>ed; the Clergyman just as he found the boat <lb/>sinking mounted his horse, one of the boatmen <lb/>mounted on one of the waggon horses, and by <lb/>this means preserved themselves till they were <lb/>relieved by a boat; the other boatman of the <lb/>name of Tim Sulivan, depending on his skill in <lb/>swimming got up an oar, but it is thought <lb/>he is drowned, as he has not since been heard <lb/>of; the boat was found in the falls, and one of <lb/>the waggon horses that had been given up for <lb/>lost, was found next day some distance below the <lb/>falls, with all his geers on, and does not appear <lb/>to have received the least injury.</p>

                <p>"One of the men who murdered the Indians <lb/>at Pine Creek, was tried on Saturday evening, <lb/>and though a number of witnesses clearly proved <lb/>the hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed, <lb/>and the confession of his counsel at the bar that <lb/>confirmed it, yet, notwithstanding an express <lb/>charge from the judges to bring him in guilty, <lb/>the jury in a few moments returned with a verdict <lb/>in his favour, and a subscription to pay the costs <lb/>of the suit, that he might be immediately set at <lb/>liberty; and all this from a most absurd idea, <lb/>which the Attorney General, with all his endea<lb break="no"/>vours, could not beat out of them, that the crime <lb/>was not the same to kill an Indian as a white <lb/>man: for some minuets the Chief Justice was mute <lb/>with astonishment. How the State can pacify <lb/>the Indians now, Heaven knows, while at this <lb/>moment the other murderers are at large in this <lb/>country, and no one will arrest them."</p>
