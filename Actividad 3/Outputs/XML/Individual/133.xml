                <p>By the Henry, arrived in the rive from Quebec, we <lb/>have advices from thence of the 4th September, three <lb/>days later than the last accounts. They confirm, we <lb/>regret to say, the intelligence received at Lloyd's on <lb/>Friday, of the death of the Duke of Richmond, at <lb/>Montreal, where he had arrived on his return from in<lb break="no"/>specting the new settlements in Upper Canada. His <lb/>body had been brought from Montreal to Quebec, <lb/>where it was lying in state at the time the Henry sail<lb break="no"/> <lb/>ed. His daughter Lady Mary Lennox, continued in <lb/>the most afflicting state, and great fears were entertain<lb break="no"/>ed for her recovery.</p>
                <p>Lady Sarah Lennoc, his Grace's second daughter, <lb/>is married to Major-General Sir Peregrine Maitland. <lb/>They accompanied his grace to North America, and <lb/>have remained there since he entered upon his Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. His Grace was the lineal descendant of the <lb/>first Duke of Richmond, natural son of King Charles <lb/>II. by a French Lady, who was created by his Majesty <lb/>Duchess of Portsmouth, and by Louis the Fourteenth, <lb/>Duchess of Aubigny, in France. His titles were, <lb/>Duke of Richmond, Early of March (English ho<lb break="no"/>nours) ; Duke of Aubigny, (French Honour) ; Duke <lb/>of Lennox, Early of Darnley, and Baron Methuen of <lb/>Torbulton (Scots Honours). The title of Aubigny was <lb/>confirmed in March 1816, by Louis XVIII by caus<lb break="no"/>ing the estate of Aubigny to be assigned to him, and <lb/>granting him the honours of the Louvre, as enjoyed by <lb/>his Grace's ancestors. He was a Lieutenant-General <lb/>in the army, Colonel of the 35th regiment of foot, Go<lb break="no"/>nervor of Plymouth, Governor of Upper and Lower <lb/>Canada and their dependencies, Lord Lieutenant of <lb/>the county of Sussex, and High Steward of Chichester. <lb/>–His Grace was born in 1764, succeeded his uncle, <lb/>Charles, the late Duke, in 1806, and married in 1783 <lb/>Charlotte, daughter of Duke of Gordon, by whom <lb/>he had issue seven sons and seven daughters, all of them <lb/>now living, except his third son, Henry Adam, R. N. <lb/>who fell overboard the Blake, as she was sailing into <lb/>Port Mahon, in 1812, and was drowned. His Grace <lb/>was distinguished early in life by a duel with His <lb/>Royal Highness the Duke of York. He was of an <lb/>open, candid, generous temper, and of plain and un<lb break="no"/>affected manners, qualities which were particularly con<lb break="no"/>spicuous in Ireland, when Viceroy of that country.</p>
                <p>His Grace is succeeded in the Peerage his eldest <lb/>son Charles, Earl of March, now Duke of Richmond. <lb/>This young Nobleman in the army, has seen much active ser<lb break="no"/>vice under the personal auspices of the illustrious Wel<lb break="no"/>lington, being one of his Grace's Aides-de-camp, and <lb/>was one of the Representatives in Parliament for the <lb/>City of Chichester, which seat, of course, becomes va<lb break="no"/>cant. He was lately married to the eldest daughter of <lb/>the Marquis of Anglesea, and has issue, a Son, now <lb/>Earl of March.</p>
                <p>The following is extracted from the Quebec papers:</p>
                <p>"Quebec, Thursday, Sept. 2. <lb/>"This Province has again been visited by one of <lb/>those afflicting dispensations of Providence, which by <lb/>separating by the hand of death, the ruler from the <lb/>people, covers whole communities with mourning.</p>
                <p>"An express arrived here yesterday morning from <lb/>Montreal, with the afflicting intelligence chief that his Grace <lb/>the Duke of Richmond, Governor in Chief of these <lb/>Provinces, had died on his way from Kingston to Mon<lb break="no"/>treal, at the moment that he was hourly expected to <lb/>join his family there, from which he had separated in <lb/>good health at Kingston, one the 20th, to complete by <lb/>visiting the new Settlements, the long and arduous <lb/>journey in which he has been engaged.</p>
                <p>This melancholy and utterly unexpected intelli<lb break="no"/>gence, spread with the greatest rapidity, and impressed <lb/>a deep gloom throughout the city. The flag on the <lb/>citadel, and on all the vessels in the port, was hoisted <lb/>half-mast, exhibiting every where the signals of public <lb/>mourning.</p>
                <p>"His Grace's body, immediately after his death, <lb/>was conveyed to Montreal. It reached this city last <lb/>evening in the steam-boat <hi rend="italic">Malsham</hi>, and was remov<lb break="no"/>ed this forenoon to the Castle, with the usual military <lb/>honours, and followed by his Grace's Staff, the prin<lb break="no"/>cipal Civil and Military Officers in the City and Gar<lb break="no"/>rison, and a great concourse of mourning inhabitants."</p>
                <p>September 5. <lb/>"His Grace's remains were conveyed from Montreal <lb/>to Quebec, in a steam-boat. At ten o'clock, one the <lb/>morning of the 2d of Sept. they were removed from the <lb/>vessel, and placed upon a hearse upon the King's Wharf <lb/>at Quebec, from whence it was conveyed to the Cha<lb break="no"/>teau of St. Louis, where they lay in state until four o'<lb break="no"/>clock on Saturday the 4th September, when they were <lb/>removed to the place of internment in the Cathedral <lb/>Church at Quebec.</p>
                <p>"On the corpse being brought out, the collar and <lb/>insignia of the Order of the Garter, with his Grace's <lb/>military and other appointments being placed on the cof<lb break="no"/>fin, the whole of the troops presented arms. On its being <lb/>placed on the hearse, the troops rested on their arms <lb/>reversed.</p>
                <p>"The procession then moved forward. It was com<lb break="no"/>posed of all the principals persons attached to the pub<lb break="no"/>lic, military and civil departments.</p>
                <p>"The military band filed off at the door of the Ca<lb break="no"/>thedral Church-yard and conducted it up the centre <lb/>aisle, when it was played on a platform, the mourners <lb/>remaining by the body. A signal was then given, when <lb/>the body was deposited – 15 guns being fired."</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter, dated Quebec, Sept 5 :–" When <lb/>I wrote the first side, I did not expect so soon to com<lb break="no"/>municate the melancholy event of the death of our Go<lb break="no"/>vernor, the Duke of Richmond, who was attacked on his <lb/>route from Upper Canada, with symptoms of hydro<lb break="no"/>phobia, which terminated his mortal career at six miles <lb/>from the settlement of Richmond. He was perfectly <lb/>sensible of his situation, and gave himself up from the <lb/>first spasm which attacked : it was occasioned by <lb/>a bite of a tame fox at Sorel, on his way to Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, about three months since. His death, at this <lb/>juncture, is looked on as very unfortuante for this coun<lb break="no"/>try, as he possessed the entire confidence of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and was about completing a plan of defence for <lb/>the Canadas, which, when executed, would establish a <lb/>water communication with our extreme points, per<lb break="no"/>fectly free from interruption, in case of a war with the <lb/>States."</p>
                <p>We are happy to learn, further, that no part of his <lb/>Grace's family was so dangerously ill, as was at first <lb/>reported. They are only in that situation which might <lb/>be expected, from so severe an affliction.</p>
                <p>Colonel Wilson had succeeded the late Duke of Rich<lb break="no"/>mond as Governor-General of both Canadas, being the <lb/>senior Officer on that station.</p>
                <p>Sir Charles Saxton, and Major M'Leod, Aides-de<lb break="no"/>Camp to his Grace the Duke of Richmond, have gone <lb/>to Lake Winnipeg, clothed with special powers, to in<lb break="no"/>vestigate the causes of the unhappy dissentions which <lb/>are said to have been lately renewed in that quarter <lb/>between the North West and Hudson's Bay Company. <lb/>By the new act, regulating the commercial intercourse <lb/>between the province of Upper Canada and the United <lb/>States, the duties on the importation of manufactures <lb/>and provisions from the States are considerably reduc<lb break="no"/>ed on [?] of the enumerated articles, although on <lb/>nails, snuff, manufactured tobacco, and spirits, they are <lb/>riased. The <hi rend="italic">ad-valorem[?]</hi>  duty is reduced from 10 to 5 <lb/>per cent.</p>
                <p>Buffalo, Aug. 4. <lb/>On Friday, came[?] on before the Court of King's <lb/>Beach, at Niagara, the trial of Robert Gourlay, Esq. <lb/>for a misdemeanour, in not obeying the orders of the <lb/>Magistrates at Niagara, in December last. Mr Gour<lb break="no"/>lay was found guilty, and banished the province.</p>
                <p>From the Quebec Gazette of 26th August: This <lb/>morning, about 9 o'clock, Lieut. Birch, of the royal <lb/>navy, put a period to his existence by shooting himself <lb/>through the head. We are informed that Mr Birch <lb/>had for sometime previous to his death laboured under <lb/>a melancholy state of mind. An amiable[?] wife and one <lb/>child are the survivors[?] of this awful [?] <cb/>The Annual Report of the Agricultural Society of <lb/>Quebec has been published from which it is evident <lb/>that a laudable spirit of enterprise has been awakened <lb/>in that important country. The Committee, who, in <lb/>the execution of their functions travelled through the <lb/>greater part of Lower Canada, conclude their Report by <lb/>putting on record a testimony they justly conceive to be <lb/>honourable to the character of the inhabitants of the <lb/>country through which they passed. Although many <lb/>hundreds of persons from all parts of their respective <lb/>Counties attended the Agricultural Meetings, which <lb/>were frequently of four or five hours duration, there <lb/>did not occur at any of them a single instance of in<lb break="no"/>toxication, disorderly conduct or personal altercation.</p>
                <p>The Grand Jury at Nassau, New Providence, have <lb/>brought in a bill against Sir Gregor M'Gregor, charging <lb/>him with aiding and abetting piracy, by issuing com<lb break="no"/>missions in the Bahamas, to subjects of Power in <lb/>unity[?] with Spain.</p>
                <p>A letter from Sierra Leone, dated the 9th of March <lb/>says–" It is with the deepest regret I inform you <lb/>that, notwithstanding the liberality of Great Britain, <lb/>and the faith of Treaties, the coasts swarms with slave <lb/>vessels, dragging thousnads of its miserable inhabitants <lb/>into endless captivity. A few days ago arrived here <lb/>the Union, of Liverpool : the Supercargo states, that <lb/>during his stay in the river Calabia, not less than eight <lb/>vessels, averaging 500 slaves each, had sailed for the <lb/>Spanish Colonies."</p>
                <p>We have received <hi rend="italic">Gibraltar Chronicles</hi>  to the 10th <lb/>ult. from which we learn that, in consequence of the <lb/>rapid increase of the fever at the Isle de Leon, his Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency Governor Don had issued a Proclamation on <lb/>the 2d ult. announcing that all communications with <lb/>Spain (except through the customary process of qua<lb break="no"/>tine) would close at sun-set on the following even<lb break="no"/>ing. Notice was also given to such of the labouring <lb/>classes as had not passed the fever, that they would be <lb/>provided with tents and encamped on the neutral ground <lb/>for their better security against infection should it un<lb break="no"/>happily appears in the fortress. They would not be suffered <lb/>to proceed to town, and follow their callings, during <lb/>the day, but heir return to the encampment at night <lb/>was peremptorily enjoined.</p>
                <p>We are happy to learn, however, by the latest advices <lb/>from the British fortress, that the garrison and inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants were not at all infected with the disease.</p>
