                <p>Repeated instances have lately occurred, in whcih dwelling<lb break="no"/>houses have suffered damage by fire, owing to the carelessnes of <lb/>servants and others, who, by way of economy, take off fires at <lb/>night and put the burning coals under the grate, not recollecting <lb/>that, in the construction of almost every house, the stone placed <lb/>under the grate is supported by timber, separated from the hearth <lb/>stone by some lime only. The wood underneath being once ig<lb break="no"/>nited, the fire will rapidly spread, and may in a few hours involve <lb/>the whole tenement in flames.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to Australia.</hi> –We understand that the esta<lb break="no"/>blishment of an Australian Company has suggested to a num<lb break="no"/>ber of public spirited individuals the idea of forming a society to <lb/>aid deserving persons in their endeavours to emigrate and settle in <lb/>New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, and that matters are <lb/>actually in progress for carrying this benevolent project into effect. <lb/>On Wednesday a meeting was held in the Freemasons' Hall, Niddry <lb/>Street, which was respectably attended, the Rev. Mr Lothian in <lb/>the Chair, when a series of resolutions were moved by William <lb/>Ellis, Esq. S. S. C., and seocnd by Robert Paul, Esq. of the <lb/>Commercial Bank. The principal object comprehended in those <lb/>were the security of the persons and property of emigrants on the <lb/>voyage–the maintenance of a regular communication with friends <lb/>left behind, and the insuring a friendly welcome, temporary ac<lb break="no"/>commodation, and facilities for permanent settlement in the country <lb/>of their adoption. It was also proposed to give assistance in <lb/>money to deserving emigrants, for the purpose of defraying the <lb/>expenses of freight and passage out–every applicant being first <lb/>well recommended, and his character subjected to strict scrutiny. <lb/>Masons, wrights, smiths, and other artisans, schoolmasters, farm<lb break="no"/> servants, and labourers, are the classes to which the principles of <lb/>the society specially apply.</p>
                <p>According to the opinion of persons largely engaged in the silk<lb break="no"/>trade, the amount of drawback to be allowed on silk that has paid <lb/>the duty will be between t300,000 and t400,000.</p>
                <p>On Sunday evening a disturbance took place in a house in <lb/>Tobago Street, and the Police were called, who, to make sure of <lb/>the rioter, secured the door ; at which a young woman, a servant, <lb/>became so much alarmed, that she leaped out of a window, situat<lb break="no"/>ed on the third floor, whereby her back was broken. She now lies <lb/>very ill in the Royal Infirmary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Army</hi> –The several Recruiting Parties throughout <lb/>Great Britain and Ireland having received their instructions, are <lb/>now actively employed in raising men for the three new Regi<lb break="no"/>ments of the Line, whose establishments, it is expected, will be <lb/>in a very short time completed. The Head-quarters of the 97th <lb/>Regiment are changedfrom Gosport to Winchester.</p>
