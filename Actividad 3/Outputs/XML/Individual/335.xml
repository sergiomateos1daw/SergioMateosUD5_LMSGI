                <p>The late violent rains have done much damage <lb/>in the country:–The bridge at Sackville is near<lb break="no"/>ly torn down, and the Mill there is much injured: <lb/>the Bridge at Nine Mills River is partly carried <lb/>away; and the different roads and causeways are <lb/>supposed to have suffered more than 2000l. will <lb/>repair.</p>
                <p>Since the retreat of the f–eral troops, under <lb/>General Harmar, the Miami Indians have com<lb break="no"/>mitted unparalleled cruelties. A large body of <lb/>them, on the 2d of February, attacked the settle<lb break="no"/>ments called Big Bottom, twenty miles from <lb/>Harman, on the Muilsingam, which they entire<lb break="no"/>ly destroyed. Eleven men and two children were <pb n="3"/> massacred, two escaped and three were taken <lb/>prisoners.</p>

                <p>The amount of the value of theexports from <lb/>the United States, for thirteen months, agreeable <lb/>to an estimate made at the Office of the Treasury, <lb/>in 20,000,000 dollars.</p>
                <p>The greatest apprehensions are entertained of <lb/>an invasion from our savage neighbours; as ac<lb break="no"/>counts from Philadelphia state, that there has <lb/>been a confederation of all the South West Indians <lb/>to fall on our frontiers early in the spring.</p>
                <p>Similiar apprehensions have driven the inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants in the country of Marcetta, from their plan<lb break="no"/>tations into the city, where they do military duty.</p>
                <p>According to the late Census, the number of <lb/>inhabitants in this commonwealth is 470,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Philadelphia, April</hi>  7. </hi><lb/>Congress met here to-day and made a house, <lb/>Articles of the Constitution, that were not liked <lb/>by many of us, are altered much for the better– <lb/>among other things, we were dissatisfied that not <lb/>any notice was taken of Religion, as we wanted <lb/>it expressly declared, that not any sect should e<lb break="no"/>ver be established in preference to another.–This <lb/>is now done. In this part of the world we know <lb/>not any thing of Toleration–all are equally free.</p>
                <p>It is said we have land for upwards of an hun<lb break="no"/>dred millions of people; we are yet about three, <lb/>so that,for sometime we have have not any great <lb/>cause to fight for territory.</p>
