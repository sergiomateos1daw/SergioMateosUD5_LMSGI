                <p><pb/>Total Charge, t7,856 0 11</p>
                <p>In January, 1823, there were 3,031 in the hulks ; 2,138 have <lb/>been received since ; 1,402 have been sent to New South Wales ; <lb/>and 300 to <hi rend="italic">Bermuda</hi>  ; 468 have been discharge by pardon or <lb/>transferred to other establishments ; 3 have escaped ; 43 have died ; <lb/>and 2,953 remained in the different hulks on 1st Janury last. <lb/>The health of these prisoners has been good, their conduct or<lb break="no"/>derly.</p>
                <p>The Office-bearers of the <hi rend="italic">Refuge for the Destitute</hi>  have, during <lb/>the last year, given relief to 424 persons. They have apprenticed <lb/>to trades, recommended to service or employment, or restored to pa<lb break="no"/>rents and friends, 214 individuals :â€“under their charge at present <lb/>154. Most of the male culprits require to be kept two years at <lb/>least. The expenditure has been very considerable. Mr Peel has <lb/>recommended a grant from Parliament.</p>
                <p>As we feared, the bill introduced for the purpose of qualifying <lb/>persons possessed of personal property to serve as juries contains <lb/>no regulations for the more impartial striking of juries, or returning <lb/>or making up of those who are to serve on each jury. There does <lb/>seem to be an improvement on the <hi rend="italic">form</hi>  of the returns to be made <lb/>by the Constables to the Sheriffs.</p>
