                <p>The mail will convey to you sufficiently afflicting <lb/>news of the voyages which the fever is committing <lb/>amongst us. Part of the 92nd and 50th have made <lb/>their escape on board the Serapis 64, which has been <lb/>roofed to, and most handsomely and humanely given <lb/>up by the Admiral for the use of the troops. The <lb/>loss in men stands about thus: 59th[?], 200[?] ; 92d, 120. <lb/>The 58th and 81st are scattered[?] ; but from all I can <lb/>learn, their loss is not great. The following is a list <lb/>of the officers and their relatives who have fallen vic<lb break="no"/>tims in the course of this month : –</p>
                <p>Lieut.-Colonel Sparrow, Deputy Adjt.-General. <lb/>Lieut.-Colonel [?], 52d regiment. <lb/>Lieut.-Colonel Hill th[?] regiment. <lb/>Major Rowe, 50th regiment, son-in-law of Pay<lb break="no"/>master Montgomery, of the 50th. <lb/>Mrs Rowe, wife of Major Rowe, whom she surviv<lb break="no"/>ed but a few hours, and daughter of Paymaster Mont<lb break="no"/>gomery. <lb/>Major Montgomery, 50th, son of Paymaster Mont<lb break="no"/>gomery. <lb/>Mrs Montgomery, wife of ditto. <lb/>Assistant Surgeon Brown, 50th, son in-law of do. <lb/>Lieut. Richardson, 50th. <lb/>Lieut. North[?], 50th. <lb/>Lieut. and Adjutant Lyon, 50th. <lb/>Two Misses Lyon, daughter of Adjutant Lyon. <lb/>Lieuts. R. M'Donald and George Mackie, 92d. <lb/>Ensign [?] [?]th <lb/>Doctor [?], Medical Staff. <lb/>Captain and Paymaster Turner, 58th. <lb/>The Misses Baxter, daughters of Quarter-Master <lb/>Baxter[?].</p>
                <p>The scenes that have occurred during this awful <lb/>mortality have been most distressing. It has not been <lb/>confined to the military, for the inhabitants have even <lb/>out numbered them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Quebec Mercury</hi>  of the [?] gives long extracts <lb/>from the American papers, respecting the [?] of a <lb/>large tract of country by the [?] Indians, to the <lb/>British Government, 2,748,000 acres, stretching from <lb/>the upper part of the midland[?] district towards the lower <lb/>part of the province, in the rear of the old settlements <lb/>on the Ottawa, and not in any manner coming into <lb/>contact with or approach within many miles of the <lb/>boundary of Louisiana. Yet, upon the supposition <lb/>that Great Britain is thus extending her Canadian ter<lb break="no"/>ritory, the American Papers are loud in their invectives <lb/>against this country.</p>
                <p>Letters have been received from Mogadoru[?], dated <lb/>the 28th September, which mention, that the plague <lb/>which had been for some time in the vicinity, had at <lb/>length broken out in that town. We are happy to add <lb/>however, that the deaths at that period were only three <lb/>or four each day, and it was then confined to the <lb/>Moors ; none of the Christians or Jews having fallen <lb/>victims to the pestilence. The weather being extreme<lb break="no"/>ly cold, great hopes were entertained that the further <lb/>progress of the disease would speedily be put a stop to <lb/>when trade, which then at a stand, would renew <lb/>its wanted[?] activity. The whole population of Moga<lb break="no"/>doru is between 10 and 12,000 persons ; by far the <lb/>greater part of whom consider it contrary to their reli<lb break="no"/>gious tenets to use any caution to prevent their taking <lb/>the infection ; and, in the event of their having it <lb/>would not, for the same reason, have recourse to any <lb/>means to counteract it.</p>
