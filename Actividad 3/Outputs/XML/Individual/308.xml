                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Theatre Royal.</hi> –The Pantomine, we ob<lb break="no"/>serve, is postponed till Friday. Meanwhile, the <lb/>theatre is crowded nightly, the public being ad<lb break="no"/>mitted at second price from the commencement <lb/>of the performances.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Music Hall.</hi> –We stated, about two month <lb/>ago, that, in connection with other improvements <lb/>in the Assembly Rooms, a plan was under consi<lb break="no"/>deration for erecting a Music Hall. We are now <lb/>happy to announce, that at a meeting of the pro<lb break="no"/>prietors of the Rooms last week, full pwers were <lb/>given to the Directors to take the requisite steps <lb/>for carrying the design into execution. The de<lb break="no"/>sire so long felt by the cultivators of music here, <lb/>will soon be realisd, by the erection of a splendid <lb/>hall, constructed with a due regard to the accom<lb break="no"/>modation both of professional men and the public, <lb/>and with a minute attention to the most recent <lb/>improvements, by which full effect is secured to <lb/>musical performances when conducted on a grand <lb/>scale. By what may be called a propitious coin<lb break="no"/>cidence, Mr Bishop, the new Professor of Music, <lb/>arrived in Edinburgh on the very day when this <lb/>resolution was come to.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Martin's Paintings.</hi> –The exhibition of <lb/>these celebrated paintings in this city has already, <lb/>we believe, attracted many visitors. They are <lb/>truly wonderful creations, and possess a power <lb/>and grandeur of which the engravings, so familiar <lb/>to the public, convey but a faint conception. In <lb/>contemplating " the Deluge," the spectator is so <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>the scene, that he is apt to overlook the details; <lb/>but these will be found on inspection to be among <lb/>the most interesting features of the picture. The <lb/>groups of perishing beings are exquisitely wrought, <lb/>while everything is made to contribute to the <lb/>terrific grandeur of the catastrophe. The other <lb/>two pictures–"Pandemonium" and "the Rivers <lb/>of Bliss," are smaller in size, but equally indica<lb break="no"/>tive of the high poetic genius of the artist. No<lb break="no"/>thing could be more striking than the contrast <lb/>these pictures present to each other–the one fear<lb break="no"/>ful beyond expression, the other exhibiting a <lb/>heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the <lb/>eye rests with delight. There are several other <lb/>valuable paintings in this collection, amongst <lb/>which is "The Offering Up of Isaac," a Rem<lb break="no"/>brandt in fine preservation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gordon's British Diorama.</hi> –This beautiful <lb/>exhibition opened on Saturday last, and has, we <lb/>understand, been crowded with visitors ever since. <lb/>It will be seen by Mr Gordon's advertisement in <lb/>to-day's paper, that the view of the Tower of <lb/>London during the recent conflagration (to which <lb/>we alluded in our last) has now arrived, and is <lb/>being exhibited along with the other views.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Broughton-place Congregation</hi>.–We <lb/>understand that the call given by Broughton<lb break="no"/>Place Congregation to the Rev. Mr Croon, San<lb break="no"/>quhar, to be colleague to the Rev. Dr. Brown, <lb/>has not been accepted, owing to the strong claims <lb/>which the affectionate people among whom he <lb/>presently labours have to continuance of his <lb/>services, and his unfitness, as he alleges, for a <lb/>charge so laborious; a result which, we learn, has <lb/>caused among the members of Broughton-Place <lb/>extreme and general regret.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cooke's Equestrian Amphitheatre, </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Leith.</hi> –Mr Cooke has generously handed over <lb/>to the Provost, for the benefit of the Destitute <lb/>Sick Society, the handsome sum of t15; being <lb/>the free proceeds of Friday evening's entertain<lb break="no"/>ment, which took place under the patronage of <lb/>the Provost and Magistrates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Captain Ross' Discoveries.</hi> –Extracts from <lb/>Captain Ross' despatches have been published in <lb/>a Parliamentary paper. From the map which <lb/>accompanies the paper, we gain a more distinct <lb/>idea of his track than the previous article copied <lb/>from the <hi rend="italic">Athenean[?]</hi>  afforded. South Victoria <lb/>Land, which he discovered, extends in latitude <lb/>from 70 1/2 south to 79, how much farther is un<lb break="no"/>known; and in longitude its eastern coast lies <lb/>between 163 and 171. Its position is directly <lb/>south from New Zealand, and at the distance of <lb/>1500 geographical miles. The length of the part <lb/>seen was fully 500 miles. It was girt with a bor<lb break="no"/>der of ice many miles in breadth, which rendered <lb/>it inaccessible. The passage southward was closed <lb/>at latitude 78 by a barrier of ice 150 feet high, <lb/>which was traced for 300 miles east from Victoria <lb/>Land. Icebergs were encountered in numbers <lb/>after they passed parallel of 63, and pack ice <lb/>at 66. The land " rose in lofy peaks from 9000 <lb/>to 12,000 feet in height, perfectly covered with <lb/>eternal snow; the <hi rend="italic">glaciers</hi>  descended from <lb/>near the mountain summits, <hi rend="italic">project many miles </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">into the ocean,</hi>  and presented a perpendicular face <lb/>of lofty cliffs." They could not reach the main<lb break="no"/>land, but landed on an island, which they found <lb/>to consist of volcanic rocks. On 28th January, <lb/>in latitude 77 1/2, longitude 169 E., they discovered <lb/>a magnificent volcano, emitting smoke and flame <lb/>in a splendid profusion," and named it Mount <lb/>Erebus. An extinct one near it was named after <lb/>the other vessel, Mount Terror. At the distance <lb/>of less than half a mile from the ice cliffs which <lb/>barred their progress southward, they had sound<lb break="no"/> <lb/>ings with 318 fathoms. These cliffs, no doubt, <lb/>reached the bottom, and, including the 150 feet <lb/>above water, <hi rend="italic">must have had an elevation fo 2000 feet </hi><lb/>of thereabout. The observations on the dip and <lb/>declination induced them to place the South Mag<lb break="no"/>netic Pole in latitude 76, and east longitude <lb/>153; and they considered its position as well as<lb break="no"/>certained as if they had reached it, though their <lb/>nearest approach to it was a point 160 miles from <lb/>it, on the east coast of Victoria Land. The pole <lb/>is probably within that region, though this can<lb break="no"/>not be positively affirmed, as its western boun<lb break="no"/>dary is unknown. The highest latitude they <lb/>reached 78. 4. They were therefore only 12 <lb/>degrees from the pole and about 4 degrees nearer <lb/>to it than Captain Weddel[?], the most successful <lb/>of their predecessors. <cb/><hi rend="smallcaps">The Non-intrusion Disclosures.</hi> –In the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi>  of yesterday there is a letter from J. <lb/>M. Hog, Esq. of Newliston, and another from <lb/>the Rev. Dr Simpson of Kirknewton, both ex<lb break="no"/>pressing their extreme surprise at the letter of <lb/>Mr Hamilton (which appeared in our last), and <lb/>strongly disclaiming all connexion with it on the <lb/>part of the General Assembly's Committee.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sabbath Observance–The Sweetie Case. </hi><lb/>–We understand that the Government of Prus<lb break="no"/>sia, thinking that the mode of keeping the Sab<lb break="no"/>bath in that country was in some respects too lax, <lb/>recently sent over a person to this country, to <lb/>learn whether our practise in Britain would not <lb/>furnish hints for improvement. Unluckily, the <lb/>very first specimens of our piety which met him <lb/>were the sweetie case, and that of the poor man <lb/>Key who was excommunicated for burying his <lb/>child on Sunday. These will of course figure in <lb/>the very front of the officer's report as the na<lb break="no"/>tural fruits of our system, and we may guess <lb/>what their effect will be in reconciling the Ger<lb break="no"/>mans to a stricter observance of Sunday! We <lb/>can, moreover, inform Butters' prosecutors, that <lb/>the fame of their exploits has already travelled, by <lb/>the aid of the Teutonic newspapers, to the utter<lb break="no"/>most parts of Germany, to the infinite amusement <lb/>of the Swabian farmers, the Saxon miners, and <lb/>the shepherds of the Riesengeberge. Key's case is <lb/>no doubt destined to enjoy equal celebrity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Airdrie–Anti-Corn-Law Conference.</hi> – <lb/>On Monday last, the members of the United <lb/>Secession Church, Airdrie, favourable to a repeal <lb/>of the Corn and Provision Laws, met, in compli<lb break="no"/>ance with the request of the Committee taking <lb/>the active management of the Conference to be <lb/>held in Edinburgh on the second week in Janu<lb break="no"/>ary next on that subject, when they unanimous<lb break="no"/>ly appointed their pastor, the Rev. Matthew <lb/>M'Gavin, A.M., Mr John Craig Waddell, pro<lb break="no"/>prietor, and Mr James Forrester, merchant in <lb/>Airdrie, to represent their sentiments at that <lb/>meeting, which is looked forward to with great <lb/>interest by the liberal portion of the inhabitants <lb/>of the burgh. The Rev. Mr Taylor, with Messrs <lb/>Adam Nimmo, contractor, and John Young, <lb/>bookseller, will represent the Independent con<lb break="no"/>gregation; and Mr Thomas Muir, pastor of the <lb/>Baptist church, will represent that body on that <lb/>occasion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Kirkcudbright–Address to the Dean </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">of Faculty,</hi> –We learn that at a meeting, held <lb/>on the 17th current, of the Clerks and Procura<lb break="no"/>tors of the Steward and COmmissary Courts, an <lb/>address was voted to Alexander Wood, Esq. on <lb/>his appointment to the office of Dean of Faculty, <lb/>and his retirement from that of Steward of <lb/>Kirkcudbright.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Distress in Paisley.</hi> –We understand that <lb/>the Bookbinders of Edinburgh purpose to give <lb/>a Grand Musical Melange in a few days, the <lb/>proceeds of which are to be handed over to the <lb/>committee for the distressed weavers in Paisley.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Musselburgh.</hi> –Mr Wilson, Treasurer to the <lb/>"Honest Town," has, by the hands of the district <lb/>committeesm collected from the contributors to <lb/>the Prince of Wales fund, nearly t100; and the <lb/>committees have already distributed 130 tons of <lb/>coals to the necessitous families in the neigh<lb break="no"/>bourhood.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Presbytery of Dalkeith–Case of Mr </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Monroe.</hi> –This Presbytery met on Tuesday the <lb/>21st current. At a former meeting an agent ap<lb break="no"/>peared for Mr Monroe, presentee to Fala, and <lb/>laid on the table of Presbytery a presentation <lb/>in his favour to the parish of Fala. It having <lb/>been objected that the presentation, and some <lb/>other papers relative thereton, bore, that Mr Mon<lb break="no"/>roe was presented merely to the parish of Fala, <lb/>and not to the united parishes of Fala and Soutra, <lb/>the agent made his appearance again at the meet<lb break="no"/>ing, which was held on Tuesday, with a supple<lb break="no"/>mentary presentation, and also a letter accept<lb break="no"/>ance from Mr Monroe. The agent, when asked, <lb/>admitted that he had not with him a Presbyterial <lb/>certificate; and he stated, that he would not ask <lb/>the Presbytery to sustain the presentation with <lb/>relative papers at that meeting. But he intimated, <lb/>that he intended to appear at the next meeting, <lb/>which is appointed to be held on the 22d of <lb/>February, and he expected to be able to show <lb/>that the Presbytery should then sustain the pre<lb break="no"/>sentation and relative documents.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Splendid Meteor.</hi> –On Tuesday evening, <lb/>about eight o'clock, a meteor of unusal size and <lb/>splendour was witnessed in this quarter. The <lb/>evening was very clear, the sky being without a <lb/>cloud, and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly, <lb/>a dazzling blaze of light burst from the sky, illu<lb break="no"/>minating Benlomond and the distant hills, the <lb/>Curse around Craigforth, and, indeed, the earth <lb/>and air on every side as far as the eye could reach, <lb/>with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The pheno<lb break="no"/>menon appeared like a ball of fire, of an oblong <lb/>shape, and apparently almost twice the size of <lb/>the moon, having at the time somewhat of the <lb/>same silvery appearance as that luminary, but <lb/>flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to <lb/>dazzle the eyes. A tail of fire somewhat re<lb break="no"/>sembling that of a rocket, but composed of the <lb/>most beautifully varied colours, streamed behind <lb/>it for a short distance, adding much to its spen<lb break="no"/>dour, and giving the whole an appearance at once <lb/>singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it <lb/>disappeared, it assumed a red glowing appear<lb break="no"/>ance, and then burst for an instant enve<lb break="no"/>loping the earth and sky in a blaze as bright and <lb/>dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared <lb/>to pass from the south to the north, inclining to<lb break="no"/>wards the earth. To the eye it seemed to burst <lb/>and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another me<lb break="no"/>teor of the same kind, but much less in size, <lb/>brilliancy, and splendour, was observed falling in <lb/>a quartr rather farther to the south, a few mi<lb break="no"/>nutes previously. It is a coincidence worthy of <lb/>notice, that a meteor, of the same nature with <lb/>that first described in the above, was seen at the <lb/>same hour in Glasgow.– <hi rend="italic">Stirly Journal.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Glasgow.</hi> –The collection made on Sabbath <lb/>afternoon last, by the Rev. Mr Macfarlane's con<lb break="no"/>gregation, Nicholson Street, Glasgow, amounted <lb/>to t46, 7s. 6d. This sum is the more praiseworthy <lb/>when it is considered that this congregation has <lb/>within a few months subscribed among themselves <lb/>nearly t1000 for the erection of their beautiful <lb/>place of worship to be called "Erskine Church," <lb/>of which they are erelong to take possession.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Unemployed in Paisley</hi>.–The number <lb/>of unemployed in Paisley has last week decreased <lb/>by 43. In Kilbarchan and Barrhead they were still <lb/>on the increase. The following is the official re<lb break="no"/>port of yesterday for Paisley and Barrhead :–</p>

The amount <lb/>of the fund now exceeds t8000, and is still on <lb/>the increase. They have given out about 700 <lb/>webs already, and are as busy as possible prepar<lb break="no"/>ing more. Unable to get a sufficiency of webs <lb/>warped in Paisley, they have sent for assistance <lb/>in this respect both to Glasgow and Johnstone. <lb/>A good deal of work has this week been given to <lb/>warpers, winders and heddle-casters. They have <lb/>taken much more spacious premises in Gilmour <lb/>Street, in order that they may the more easily <lb/>supply both town and country weavers. It is <lb/>desirable that the implement fund should be <lb/>somewhat enlarged, as the other funds of the <lb/>Committee are not trenched on for that purpose <lb/>– <hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ducal Generosity</hi>.–After the late county <lb/>meeting at Hamilton, at which addresses were <lb/>voted to the Queen and Prince Albert, his Grace <lb/>the Duke of Hamilton and several of those who <lb/>had attended the meeting visited the jail. One <lb/>respectable looking female attracted his Grace's <lb/>attention; and on inquiry he was told that she was <lb/>the widow of a respectable wood merchant, now <lb/>deceased, and had been confined for upwards of a <lb/>year, at the instance of a law agent in Edinburgh, <lb/>for costs incurred in a suit in the Court of Session. <lb/>His Grace immediately caused the truth of the <lb/>poor woman's story to be investigated, and on <lb/>being satisfied of the facts he caused the debt to <lb/>be paid by his factor, and procured the woman's <lb/>liberation, who has thus through his Grace's <lb/>generosity been restored to liberty and to the <lb/>superintendence of her young family.– <hi rend="italic">Reformers' </hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">Gazette.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Presentation.</hi> –A number of the members <lb/>of the United Secession Church, Airdrie, met in <lb/>their vestry on the evening of Wednesday the <lb/>22d inst. when Councillor Brown, in name of the <lb/>congregation, presented the Rev. M. M'Gavin, <lb/>A.M., their pastor, with a handsome pulpit gown <lb/>and cassock, as a mark of their respect and <lb/>esteem; after which a number of the influential <lb/>members of the congregation entertained him to <lb/>supper supper in Mr Witherspoon's King's Arms Inn– <lb/>Mr Daniel Gray, collector, Coltness Railway, in <lb/>the chair, and Dr Clarkson, croupier–when the <lb/>evening was spent in the most friendly, happy, <lb/>and intellectual manner.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">A Rescue</hi>.–Last week, while the Duke of <lb/>Hamilton was riding along the wood leading from <lb/>Hamilton to Bothwell, he heard the screams of a <lb/>female, and on looking towards the place whence <lb/>the cries came, he perceived a stout Irishman be<lb break="no"/>labouring a woman in a most unmerciful style. <lb/>No sooner did he observe this, than he rode up to <lb/>the scene of cruelty, dismounted from his horse, <lb/>knocked the savage down, rescued the woman, <lb/>and sent her home rejoicing, with more money in <lb/>her pocket than it may have been her lot to possess <lb/>for a long time. When we recollect that his <lb/>Grace was born so long ago as October 1767, and <lb/>so is in his 75th year, we cannot sufficiently ad<lb break="no"/>mire his gallantry, humanity, and intrepidity– <lb/><hi rend="italic">Glasgow Chronicle.</hi> <cb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Town Council.</hi> –The usual meeting of Coun<lb break="no"/>cil did not take place yesterday in consequence of <lb/>the Christmas holidays.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">House of Industry.</hi> –We understand that <lb/>Miss Grace Bailie had left a legacy to the Edin<lb break="no"/>burgh House of Industry of ten pounds sterling.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Old Church</hi>.–The Lords of her Majesty's <lb/>Treasury have officially intimated to the parties <lb/>interested their intention to adhere to the original <lb/>arrangement made with the Town Council, for <lb/>altering the Assembly Aisle, and rendering it fit <lb/>to be permanently used as a place of worship <lb/>for the accomodation of one of the city congre<lb break="no"/>gations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prince of Wales Fund.</hi> –In the table of <lb/>sums subscribed in the different Wards of Police, <lb/>published in our paper of Saturday last, that indi<lb break="no"/>cated for the 26th Ward was t120, 12s. 9d. Mr <lb/>Lindores, the General Commissioner, requests us <lb/>to state, that the sum subscribed in his Ward was <lb/>t275, 12s. 9d., and that the difference between the <lb/>two sums is the amount of the very handsome <lb/>subscriptions by the Banks in St Andrew Square, <lb/>and which were drawn by the Treasurer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Presentation of Plate.</hi> –On Friday after<lb break="no"/>noon, about fifty citizens entertained Mr William <lb/>Donaldson, of the Albion Cloth Company, to an <lb/>elegant dinner and dessert, in the Turf Hotel, <lb/>Princes Street, for the purpose of presenting him <lb/>with a testimonial of their esteem, subscribed for <lb/>by the members of the Celtic Lodge, and other <lb/>private friends. Mr William Wright, hat manu<lb break="no"/>facturer, was in the chair, supported on the right <lb/>and left by the guest of the evening, Mr Pritchard <lb/>of the Theatre-Royal, and other gentlemen. Mr <lb/>Dick of the Albion officiated as croupier. After <lb/>the usual loyal and preliminary toasts had been <lb/>given, the chairman called for a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>  bumper <lb/>for the toast of the evening, and, after passing <lb/>a handomse eulogium on those various quali<lb break="no"/>ties of their guest which had endeared him to <lb/>all his friends, neighbours, and acquaintances, <lb/>far and wide, presented to Mr Donaldson, in the <lb/>name of the subscribers, a very elegant and <lb/>massive silver tea set, of the value of t50. Mr <lb/>Donaldon's health was then proposed and drunk <lb/>with warm and friendly enthusiasm. The pre<lb break="no"/>sentee replied to the compliment in modest and <lb/>appropriate terms. The company spent an ex<lb break="no"/>ceedingly happy and convivial night; the chair<lb break="no"/>man and croupier taking care that there should <lb/>be no flagging in the jovialty. The toasts were <lb/>suitable to the occasion. Mr Mackenzie's instru<lb break="no"/>mental band played appropriate airs to the va<lb break="no"/>rious toasts and sentiments; and vocal music, <lb/>from amateurs, was never wanting; the guest <lb/>himself being a host in that department. The <lb/>following inscription is neatly engraved on the <lb/>various pieces of playe :–"To Mr William Don<lb break="no"/>aldson, R.W.M. of the Lodge Celtic of Edinburgh <lb/>and Leith, from a number of Masonic and other <lb/>Friends.–24th Dec. 1841."</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theft and Recovery of a Pony.</hi> –At a late <lb/>hour on Sunday night a gentleman residing in <lb/>the southern part of the town dismounted from <lb/>his pony at his own gate, and proceeding inwards, <lb/>leaving the animal to follow, as he was wont to <lb/>do, to the stable. On looking about, he observed <lb/>a young man, whom he supposed to be his son, <lb/>take the reins and mount the pony. Shortly <lb/>afterwards the son came into the house, and the <lb/>question of "Where is the pony?" soon convinced <lb/>the parties that it was stolen. They immediately <lb/>proceeded in search, and while the gentleman <lb/>was giving information at the Police-Office, his <lb/>son discovered the pony with a rider on the North <lb/>Bridge. He immediately seized the reins and <lb/>made a clutch at the thief; but the latter very <lb/>adroitly threw himself off at the opposite side, <lb/>ran down the Fleshmarket stairs, and escaped.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Providential Recovery.</hi> –One day last <lb/>week, a fine little child, about five years of age, <lb/>belonging to one of the villagers at Ratho, having <lb/>dandered[?] away with another little play-fellow, <lb/>like himself, to a little distance from the house, <lb/>fell into a deep well. His companion was found <lb/>standing weeping at the edge. The apparently <lb/>dead body of the little one being got out, was <lb/>taken home, and all hopes of its recovery given <lb/>up, when Dr Pringle, and excellent young gentle<lb break="no"/>man, who is presently assistant of Dr Craig at <lb/>Ratho, made his appearance, and, by applying <lb/>himself with indefatiguable perseverance, succeed<lb break="no"/>ed in recalling the apparently extinguished spark. <lb/>The next the little romp was as lively as <lb/>ever.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mungo Park.</hi> –A public meeting was held in <lb/>the town hall of Selkirk, on Monday the 26th <lb/>current, the Chief Magistrate in the chair; when <lb/>various resolutions were adopted with the view <lb/>of erecting a monument or other permanent <lb/>mark of respect for the memory of this celebrat<lb break="no"/>ed traveller.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Thimble-Riggers.</hi> –A band of thimble-rig<lb break="no"/>gers from Edinburgh have for several weeks past <lb/>been infesting the roads in the neighbourhood of <lb/>Glasgow. They are six in number and one of <lb/>them, an old man of rather respectable appear<lb break="no"/>ance, is generally in advance of the party, and <lb/>having got into conversation with a passenger on <lb/>the road, and the others running up, and desiring <lb/>the old man to try his luck; he does so, and win<lb break="no"/>ning a trifle, he easily persuades the person with <lb/>whom he has been ingratiating himself to try <lb/>also, and he is soon robbed of his whole spare <lb/>cash. Information having, on Wednesday last, <lb/>been given to the Procurator-Fiscal at Pollok<lb break="no"/>shaws, and the gang were on the new Kilmar<lb break="no"/>nock Road, he immediately despatched two rural <lb/>police officers in pursuit of them. On the officers <lb/>coming up to the gang, they separated and ran <lb/>off, but the officers captured two of them (the old <lb/>man and another), who were safely lodged in <lb/>Pollokshaws Jail; and having been brought be<lb break="no"/>fore two of the Justices, and several person hav<lb break="no"/>ing sworn to being defrauded by them of their <lb/>money, they were sentenced tothirty days' im<lb break="no"/>prisonment in Paisley House of Correction, with <lb/>hard labour, as rogues and vagabonds; and an <lb/>active look-out is made by the police for the re<lb break="no"/>mainder of the gang.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stoppage of Payments by the Town of </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Paisley.</hi> –Partly on account of the great depres<lb break="no"/>sion of trade, and partly on account of a run raised <lb/>by the circulation of malicious and false state<lb break="no"/>ments regarding the affairs of the community of <lb/>Paisley, theTown Council, at a meeting on Wed<lb break="no"/>nesday evening, ordered the Chamberlain to sus<lb break="no"/>spend receipt or payment of deposits, in the mean<lb break="no"/>time, but to proceed with all possible despatch in <lb/>realizing the outstanding debts due to the com<lb break="no"/>munity for the regular payment of the interest on <lb/>the money borrowed, and other current engage<lb break="no"/>ments of the burgh. It is pretty generally <lb/>known that a small portion of the would-be-po<lb break="no"/>litical leaders of the town who have not the <lb/>influence to get themselves placed in municipal <lb/>authority, have for a good number of years endea<lb break="no"/>voured to embarass the party in power, by attack<lb break="no"/>ing the credit of the community. The unfavour<lb break="no"/>about state of trade and the leniency of the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil in not enforcing during the last year the ex<lb break="no"/>actions on the owners of property, for entries, &amp;c. <lb/>falling due, caused a deficiency of nearly t300 <lb/>in the usual amount of revenue. This simple <lb/>circumstance was taken advantage of, though <lb/>nothing was lost thereby, and statements prejudi<lb break="no"/>cial to the town's credit were placed in the hands <lb/>of every credito that could be found by the indi<lb break="no"/>viduals referred to, and thus uncalled for alarm <lb/>raised. In addition to this, the adherents of the <lb/>same party in the Council during the last five <lb/>days gave currency to another statement which <lb/>they knew to be quite untrue, about the late Pro<lb break="no"/>vost having commenced to secure himself by <lb/>drawing a thousand pounds, when the fact was he <lb/>had not drawn out a penny. From the position <lb/>to which which the affiars the town are now driven <lb/>a full and public exposure of these matters will <lb/>soon be submitted to the creditors. The Council <lb/>have been negotiating for such a loan of money <lb/>as will pay off those who are dissatisfied, which <lb/>in the ordinary state of the money market they <lb/>would long since have obtained, though at present <lb/>that is difficult. As regards risk to the creditors, <lb/>from the best informed quarters we are assured <lb/>there is none. More than one-third of the whole <lb/>debts of the town are due to the Bank and the <lb/>members of Council, or their immediate friends, <lb/>and fully a half of the debt against the river is due <lb/>to the same parties. This we should conceive the <lb/>strongest proof that could be adduced of the con<lb break="no"/>fidence of those who should best know the state <lb/>of the town's affairs.– <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Chronicle.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Disgraceful Trick</hi>.–At a late wake in the <lb/>country, a short way from Crieff, a waggish fel<lb break="no"/>low tied a cord secretly to the neck of the corpse <lb/>and while a number of young men and women <lb/>present were going on merrily with some sport <lb/>the wag pulled the cord, when corpse started <lb/>up in the bed, making the clothes to fly off; the <lb/>whole party rushed to the door, crying for mercy <lb/>upon them, and knocking each other over in the <lb/>hurry, when at length some people came to their <lb/>assistance, who afterwards discovered the cause <lb/>of their terror.– <hi rend="italic">Perth Courier.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Church Question.</hi> –Long ago, Dr Chal<lb break="no"/>mers let out the secret of the clerical movement, <lb/>by declaring that very little of Non-intrustion <lb/>would satisfy him and his friends, provided the <lb/>independent power of the Church were secured. <lb/>Now, this <hi rend="italic">liberum arbitrium</hi>  does nothing at all <lb/>for Non-intrusion; but it does a great deal for <lb/>Church Independence. It confers no privilege on <lb/>the laity; but it adds immeasurably to the power <lb/>of the clergy. It is, in fact, the very worst part <lb/>of the claims that have been advanced by the <lb/>Church; and its effects would simply be to sacri<lb break="no"/>fice the lay Non-intrusionists on the one hand, <lb/>and clerical Moderates on the other. It <lb/>means literally uncontrolled power to the Church <cb/><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi>  General Steam Navigation Company's ship <lb/>Monarch, Captain Fraser, arrived at Granton from <lb/>London on Monday evening at half-past nine <lb/>o'clock.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Election of a Minister for Old Monk- </hi><lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">land.</hi> –The election of a minster took place at <lb/>Old Monkland Church, on Thursday the 23d inst., <lb/>and the right of patronage being vested in the <lb/>Heritors and Kirk-Session, the election might be <lb/>considered a popular one. About 150 voters at<lb break="no"/>tended the meeting, and a decided wish having <lb/>been expressed by, it is understood, the whole of <lb/>the heritors that no candidate known to be con<lb break="no"/>nected with the Non-intrusion party in the Church <lb/>should be chosen, the meeting, acting upon this <lb/>principle, unanimously agreed to elect the Rev. <lb/>Mr Johnston, Greenock, as minister of the parish. <lb/>Considering the number of voters, the unanimity <lb/>that prevailed among the electors, it is believed, <lb/>is without precedent and stongly marks the <lb/>sentiments and feelings of a large and very popu<lb break="no"/>lous parish on the present proceedings of the do<lb break="no"/>minant party in th Church. Mr Johnston was <lb/>proposed by General Pye Douglass of Rosehall, <lb/>seconded by Mr M'Caul of Daldowie, and unani<lb break="no"/>mously elected.– <hi rend="italic">Reformers' Gazette.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Destructive Fire.</hi> –About three o'clock on <lb/>the morning of the 25th curt., an alarm of fire <lb/>was given at Balmangan Mill, in the parish of <lb/>Rerwick. The premises are occupied by Mr <lb/>Kissock, and despite the great exertions of him<lb break="no"/>self, servants and neighbours, the work of de<lb break="no"/>struction proceeded with a degree of rapidity <lb/>that rendered it impossible to save a single arti<lb break="no"/>cle. The flames in their fury having charred the <lb/>rafters, the roof fell in with a loud crash; and, <lb/>before long, the entire mill, with the exception <lb/>of the side walls, became an unbroken mass of <lb/>ruins. The building contained a considerable <lb/>quantity of grain and oatmeal, the property of <lb/>the tacksman, all of which was unforunately de<lb break="no"/>stroyed. As the premises were found quite safe <lb/>a very few hours previously, suspicion of incen<lb break="no"/>diarism have naturally arisen, but no clue thus <lb/>far has been found attaching guilt to a single in<lb break="no"/>dividual. The fire, if wilful, implies the blackest <lb/>malice, and it is sad to think that any one could <lb/>have been so wicked as to destroy what thousands <lb/>are in want of, and would gladly toil for, if they <lb/>only knew how–daily bread– <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hamilton.</hi> –Some influential persons in Ha<lb break="no"/>milton and the neighbourhood have subscrib<lb break="no"/>ed to build an Episcopal chapel in that town. <lb/>We have been informed that all the requisite <lb/>arrangements have been made for carrying <lb/>the views of the subscribers into effect. This <lb/>is one effect of the conduct of the rebellious <lb/>majority of the General Assembly. Many of <lb/>thsoe now friendly to the scheme, never dreamed <lb/>of espousing Episcopacy, till they have been <lb/>driven in disgust from the Church of their fathers, <lb/>by the conduct of their ministers; men who exist <lb/>in their offices by law, and yet set that very <lb/>law at defiance, in virtue of which they hold offices, <lb/>and draw their "temporalities," as they cantingly <lb/>term their good things, which alone induce some <lb/>of them, at least, to remain members of the vene<lb break="no"/>rable Establishment. Who would have believed, <lb/>some years ago, that "Black Prelacy" was about <lb/>to be established within sight of Bothwell Brigg!</p>
