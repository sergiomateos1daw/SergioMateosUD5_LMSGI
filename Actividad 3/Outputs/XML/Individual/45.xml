                <p><pb/><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Martinique</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Oct</hi>. 6.</hi></p>
                <p>The disturbances in this island are so far from <lb/>having abated, that they seem daily to gain ad<lb break="no"/>ditional force. The French General, after the <lb/>and endeavoured to bring over a part of the mi<lb break="no"/>litary to his side, against the people : He began <lb/>with subalterns, several of whom took a cer<lb break="no"/>tain oath of attachment which he administered to <lb/>them ; but when he came to the Major, that of<lb break="no"/>ficer declined, saying he had already engaged <lb/>himself on the <hi rend="italic">side of the people</hi>. Incensed at this <lb/>reply, he reviled him in very opprobrious terms, <lb/>and at last laid his cane upon him !</p>
                <p>Frustrated in his attempts upon the infantry, <lb/>he made his next application to the regiment of <lb/>artillery, but with as little success. They inform<lb break="no"/>ed him, that themselves and Culverins were sta<lb break="no"/>tioned there for the protection of the <hi rend="italic">people</hi>, and <lb/>for <hi rend="italic">them</hi>  only should be used.</p>
                <p>Driven to the last shift, his distress suggested <lb/>the sorry expedient of having recourse to the <hi rend="italic">peo<lb break="no"/>ple</hi>  of <hi rend="italic">colour</hi>, who <hi rend="italic">here</hi>  form a considerable corps. <lb/>By a small dose of flattery these people, so rea<lb break="no"/>dily to be caught by a little seeming attention, <lb/>promised to stand by him ; and did so, as long <lb/>as they usually stand firm to any thing–that is, till <lb/>their fears for their own persons became an ob<lb break="no"/>ject of more weighty concern–they then aban<lb break="no"/>doned him.</p>
                <p>The humiliating familiarities to which he de<lb break="no"/>scended to this motley rabble, were truly disgust<lb break="no"/>ing. He embraced them; called them his <hi rend="italic">enfans </hi><lb/>and <hi rend="italic">cher amis</hi>, and practised all the dirty conde<lb break="no"/>scensions, which those only who are conversant in <lb/>the praise-worthy art of cajoling, can form any <lb/>conception of.</p>
                <p>The effect of this conduct was, as might be ex<lb break="no"/>pected, insolence–one of this banditti presumed <lb/>to strike a grenadier–this incensed both the mi<lb break="no"/>litary and the peopl–the consequence was, their <lb/>doughty leader was laid hold of, when his trusty <lb/>defenders left him to his fate. He wa sput into <lb/>confinement, and had the pleasure of beholding <lb/>from the windows of his prison, him whom he had <lb/>inspired with the insolent temerity to strike <lb/>White, suspended on a gibbet.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of St. Pierre then assembled <lb/>to confer on the measures to be taken on this oc<lb break="no"/>casion, when ten deputies were chosen to bring <lb/>the deposed Commander to that part of the island <lb/>for trial, and twelve Judges were chosen to pre<lb break="no"/>side at that very important tribunal.</p>
                <p>Thus stood matters on Thursday last, at which <lb/>time a rumour prevailed that the Marquis de <lb/>Bouillee had suffered death by the extraordinary <lb/>and ingenious method of being put between two <lb/>planks and severed in pieces by a cross-cut saw.</p>
