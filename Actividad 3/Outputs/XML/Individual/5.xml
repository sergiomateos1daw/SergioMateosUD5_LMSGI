                <p>"We are dreadfully alarmed at present on ac<lb break="no"/>count of the great scarcity of flour throughout <lb/>the province. Common flour sold this morning <lb/>in the market at six dollars, per cwt. bran from <lb/>7s. 6d. to 6s. oats 3s. per bushel, and pease 20d. <lb/>per bushel. There has been an account taken of <lb/>the quantity of flour and wheat in this city, and <lb/>liberties, by order of the Governor and Council, <lb/>and we find there is not more than will serve as <lb/>ten days. They ar much worse off in the district <lb/>of Montreal than we are here: We have sent <lb/>them frequent supplies.</p>
                <p>"Wheat which was found too bad to be ship<lb break="no"/>ped last year at three livres, now sells at two <lb/>dollars. One Merchant will make upwards of <lb/>fifteen hundred pounds by this job.</p>
                <p>"Government, for the relief of the poor, have <lb/>caused to be issued, by the contractor here, rise <lb/>at 3 d. per lb. no one to get more than a dol<lb break="no"/>lar's worth at a time. The day before yesterday <lb/>there was delivered above a hundred pounds worth <lb/>in this way.</p>
                <p>"In consequence of letters by last Thursday's <lb/>post from Montreal, two thousand bushels of da<lb break="no"/>maged wheat were shipped yesterday for that <lb/>market. We have not had a grain of flour from <lb/>England or the States, though we hear of a car<lb break="no"/>go from New York, for Montreal. The vessel <lb/>was to call at New Brunswick ; and it is more <lb/>than probably, that people there, being in great <lb/>want themselves, have detained her. The Go<lb break="no"/>vernment have done now what they should have <lb/>done five or six months ago, and then we should <lb/>not be in this starving condition ; that is, we are <lb/>to have a proclamation to permit the importation <lb/>of grain and flour from the States.</p>
                <p>"My servant is just come home from the ba<lb break="no"/>ker's, where I had sent him for half a dollar's <lb/>worth of bread. After watching for two hours, <lb/>till the bread came out of the overn, he could get <lb/>but eighteen-pennyworth ; three small loaves, <lb/>indeed, weighing only two pounds each. Thir<lb break="no"/>ty-five shillings have been paid for ship biscuit. <lb/>The Lord knows what will become of usâ€“ex<lb break="no"/>cept Government will distribute some of the <lb/>flour that is come for the troops, in the Queen.</p>
                <p>"Mr. Davidson, one of the Council, assured us <lb/>on Thursday last, there was not wheat and flour</p>
                <p><pb/>in the country for five weeks. He has taken a <lb/>great deal of pains to be well informed on the sub<lb break="no"/>juct; and to him are we indebted for the procla<lb break="no"/>mation to allow the importation from the States. <lb/>He stood forth alone, and offered, at his own <lb/>expence, to get an account taken of the quanti<lb break="no"/>ties of wheat and flour in the town and liberties <lb/>of Quebec, and insisted on its being taken into <lb/>consideration."</p>
