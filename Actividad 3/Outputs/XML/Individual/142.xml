                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to America</hi></p>
                <p>Important Extracts of a Letter from a very Intelligent and re<lb break="no"/>spectable Engineer in Louisville, dated January 20. 1819.</p>
                <p>"The best time for coming to America I <lb/>should judge to be in the summer, to land in <lb/>September, so as to be able to get here before <lb/>the weather was too cold. It is safe to <lb/>settle in the beginning of winter or spring, so as <lb/>to inure to the climate by degrees. The best <lb/>plan for coming is to take a part of the steerage <lb/>of a vessel, and find your own provisions; you <lb/>will save more in this way, over a cabin passage, <lb/>than would buy a decent farm here. The lands <lb/>in this neighbourhood raise a crop of wheat and <lb/>one of corn alternately, and improve ; dung is <lb/>never applied, and is said to be hurtful. It is <lb/>without question what the land here is as good as <lb/>can be, and when to this is added the heat of <lb/>the summer, one ought to be able to raise crops <lb/>as heavy as they will stand. You wonder at 10 <lb/>dollars being enough to clear an acre. It is not <lb/>cleared, all the trees under 12 inches are cut <lb/>down and burned on the ground, and the large <lb/>ones are killed by cutting round the bark. The <lb/>ground is then prepared for Indian corn by <lb/>scratching it with a hoe, or a kind of shuffle, <lb/>which, from the looseness and mellowness of the <lb/>soil, is easily done, and in this way sixty or <lb/>eighty bushels an acre are sometimes raised. â€“ <lb/>the trees die in a few months, and in three or <lb/>four years fall down one by one, and the roots <lb/>will rot out in seven or eight years. It is a <lb/>great want of sense in any new settler not to <lb/>adopt the modes of this country, proven to be the <lb/>best adapted to the state of it by 200 years ex<lb break="no"/>perience. The Americans, of all other people I <lb/>know of, are the most ingenious in adapting the <lb/>means to the end. I do not know if they have <lb/>more sense than other nations, but they certain<lb break="no"/>ly make it go farther. Every tools answers the <lb/>purpose most effectually. This is evident in their <lb/>axes. An American will cut down three times <lb/>more trees and square three times more timber <lb/>than the best of your wrights could do, and not <lb/>by more strength but by fitter tools. So it is <lb/>with cutting their grain ; a man will cut down <lb/>four acres of wheat in a day, what what he calls <lb/>a cradle scythe, and lay it as refular for bind<lb break="no"/>ing as reapers can do. Sixty bushels of Indian <lb/>corn is the average of Kentucky ; but 25 bushels <lb/>of wheat is about the average of an acre. It is <lb/>easier farming here than with you on sundry ac<lb break="no"/>counts ; the soil is free, few weeds make their <lb/>appearance, and when ploughed down are cer<lb break="no"/>tainly killed by the hot sun. There are no frosts <lb/>to injure the crop, and no wet weather to de<lb break="no"/>stroy it when cut. Hay is made in two days, <lb/>and grain is cut one day and stacked or housed <lb/>the next. From the shortness and mildness of <lb/>the winter, little provender is needed for the <lb/>stock. Swine are raised at no expence. They <lb/>breed and feed in the woods, and only want from <lb/>one to three bushels of corn to fatten for killing, <lb/>when they sell for five cents a lb. In the less <lb/>settled parts of the country, it is the practise to <lb/>give all the corn to swine and then send them to <lb/>market. A bushel of corn is equal in nutriment <lb/>to a bushel of wheat for man or beast.</p>
