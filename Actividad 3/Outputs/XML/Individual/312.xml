                <p><pb/>There is something curious in the preference <lb/>which the emigrants from England, Scotland, and <lb/>Ireland display for different localities. The pro<lb break="no"/>portions emigrating the countries below are as <lb/>follows:–</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigrants </hi><lb/>English Per cent. Scottish Per cent. Irish Per Cent. <lb/>To United States, 54, 14 1/2, 12 <lb/>– Sydney, 17, 21 1/2, 7 <lb/>– Canada, 8 1/2, 25, 50 <lb/>– Port-Philip, 8, 14, 7</p>
                <p>As the table expressly bears to be " a return of <lb/>the persons who have <hi rend="italic">emigrated</hi>," we can scarcely <lb/>suppose that it includes persons who went out to <lb/>the countries mentioned on business, without any <lb/>intention of settling. In the report for Canada, <lb/>the number who went to the United States in <lb/>1841, is stated to be only 32,500, or about two<lb break="no"/> thirds of what stands in the above table.</p>
                <p>It will be observed, that not a single emigrant <lb/>to India or Ceylon appears in the table; yet sure<lb break="no"/>ly some persons go with the express view of re<lb break="no"/>maining in these countries.</p>
                <p>The number of person who were enabled to <lb/>emigrate in 1841 by means of bounties payable in <lb/>the colonies, was, for New South Wales 22,752, <lb/>for Van Diemen's Land 331. It must be remem<lb break="no"/>bered that New South Wales includes Port<lb break="no"/>Philip.</p>
                <p>There are returns of land sold, but not in a <lb/>very perfect form. In Canada, in the year 1839, <lb/>1840, and 1841, the lands sold were 176,518 acres. <lb/>The average price was 3s. to 3s. 8d. in Lower, and <lb/>12s. to 13s. in Upper Canada; the lands granted <lb/>without sale were 194,000 acres, exclusive of those <lb/>for Lower Canada in 1841. In Nova Scotia, New <lb/>Brunswick, and Cape Breton, about 200,000 acres <lb/>have been sold at prices varying from 2s. 3d. to <lb/>3s. 8d. The lands granted are inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>At the Cape, 129,000 acres have been sold in the <lb/>three years, at prices from 2s. 5d. to 3s. 3d.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lands sold in New South Wales </hi><lb/>Acres. Average Price. <lb/>Sydney District–1839, 234,272, 8s 2 1/2d. <lb/>1840, 105,900, 18s. 8 1/2d. <lb/>1841, 15,790, 20s. 0 1/2d. <lb/>Port-Philip–1839, 38,343 36s. 6 1/2d. <lb/>1840, 83,687, 51s. 11 3/4d. <lb/>(Six months)–, 53,733, 20s. 0d. <lb/>531,930</p>
                <p>The sales were chiefly by auction.</p>
                <p>In Van Diemen's Land, the sales in 1839, 1840, <lb/>were about 130,000 acres, at 10s. or 11s.; in West<lb break="no"/>ern Australia (Swan River), in 1839, 1840, 1841, <lb/>the sales were 71,000 acres, from 6s. 1d. to 11s.; in <lb/>South Australia, 55,000 acres, at 20s. The sales <lb/>of land are no bad index of the progress of the <lb/>colonies in capital and cultivation; and, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to this criterion, it will be seen, that those <lb/>which were advancing most rapidly in the three <lb/>years, were Sydney and Port-Philip. The money <lb/>received in payment of land in these two colonies <lb/>in 1839 and 1840, amounted to t307,647; and, if <lb/>we understand the report correctly, the whole of <lb/>this sum is applicable to emigration, that is, to <lb/>defraying the expense of carrying out emigrants.</p>
                <p>The 118,592 emigrants probably carried with <lb/>them, or expended on their passage, twenty <lb/>pounds each; and thus the money which left the <lb/>country must have amounted to upwards of two <lb/>millions.</p>
                <p>This gigantic emigration one of the things <lb/>which convey an idea of the immense resources of <lb/>Britain. The United Kingdom contains only the <lb/>ninth part of the population of Europe; and we <lb/>believe it may be safely said, that all the other <lb/>eight parts do not send out half the number of <lb/>emigrants annually which are sent by the British <lb/>Isles alone.</p>
