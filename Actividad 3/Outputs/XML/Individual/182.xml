                <p>New York, May 8. <lb/>The sloop Hero, Capt. Palmer, arrived at <lb/>Stonington, last Tuesday, in seventy-three days <lb/>from New South Iceland, with a cargo of oil. <lb/>ON the 28th of March, in lat. 21. S. long. 35. W. <lb/>spokethe Brig Wilner, of London, from Buenos <lb/>Ayres, bound to Falmouth, England ; the Cap<lb break="no"/>tain of which informed Capt. P. that the Chilian <lb/>army, near Peru, had fought two battles with the <lb/>Royal army, in both of which the Chilian army <lb/>was victorious ; and it was supposed would cause <lb/>the surrender of Peru soon to the Chilians.</p>
                <p>May 15. <lb/>The gigantic projects that occupy the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of our countrymen are truly surprising. A <lb/>plan is now forming, for example, to establish a <lb/>settlement at the mouth of the river Columbia, <lb/>for the purpose of importing teas direct from the <lb/>East Indies. It is then proposed to transport <lb/>this article of merchandize up the Columbia, un<lb break="no"/>til it reaches the rocky mountains, and then to <lb/>proceed by land to the navigable branch of the <lb/>Missouri. This embraces a space of three <lb/>hundred and forty miles in extent. Of this dis<lb break="no"/>tance 200 miles are represented by travellers as <lb/>constituting an excellent road ; the remaining <lb/>one hundred and forty comprehend the moun<lb break="no"/>tain barrier, which must be passed by the intre<lb break="no"/>pidity and labour of man. The merchandize <lb/>will then, by the aid of the Missouri and its <lb/>subsidiary streams, supply the whole western <lb/>continent with the refreshing beverage. This <lb/>shows the varied changes of commerse ; the <lb/>Atlantic States have heretofore been the medium <lb/>of supplying our western States with the pro<lb break="no"/>ductions of China ; but if this plan should be <lb/>carried into effect, we may receive our supply <lb/>from that country through the western States.</p>
                <p>May 16. <lb/>It is worthy of remark, that among the nu<lb break="no"/>merous arrivals at this port yesterday, were three <lb/>British brigs from Dundee. This makes good <lb/>the remark of a late Scotch gazette, that <lb/>Dundee was becoming a place of considerable <lb/>trade.</p>
