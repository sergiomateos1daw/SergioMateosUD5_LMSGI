                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">To the PRINTER</hi>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir,</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">ABOUT</hi>  two month ago I went to the coun<lb break="no"/>try to pay a visit to a friend in a remote <lb/>county; and though I am much of what may be called "a <hi rend="italic">newspaper man</hi>," I never thought of or<lb break="no"/>dering my papers to be sent down to me. To <lb/>my utter astonishment, my <hi rend="italic">rustic</hi>  landlord did <lb/>not take in own newspaper; so there was I, stuck <lb/>down, with my friend in the country–knowing <lb/>no more of what passed in town than if I had <lb/>been in <hi rend="italic">Lapland</hi>. Intending every day should be <lb/>my last, I went on without ordering your, or any <lb/>other paper, till two months had passed away, at <lb/>which period I returned to town. And there, <lb/>Sir, I was quite a new man, and just as if I had <lb/>dropped down from the clouds. Every day I <lb/>heard people talking of occurrences of which I <lb/>knew nothing : Revolutions in France by <hi rend="italic">Fish<lb break="no"/>women</hi>  ; and battles in Flanders, against the <lb/>Emperor, who I thought was fighting against <lb/>the Turks.</p>
                <p>But even this was not the most distressing–for <lb/>one day meeting a friend, I inquired very cor<lb break="no"/>dially after his wife, who I found a few days af<lb break="no"/>terwards, had eloped just before with another <lb/>gentleman ; and meeting with a lady, I inquir<lb break="no"/>ed kindly for her sister, who I found had depart<lb break="no"/>ed to the other world a fortnight before.</p>
                <p>On this account I never will stir again "out of <lb/>the world" unless your paper goes along with me. I <lb/>hold a newspaper to be a kind of <hi rend="italic">viaticum</hi>  with <lb/>which every man should be provided, and which be<lb break="no"/>come the more necessary the further we remove <lb/>from town It. is the only way to keep pace with <lb/>what is going on every day in the fashionable or <lb/>literary world–and to prevent talking about dead <lb/>friends, or wives that have absconded.</p>
                <p>In short, Sir, a newspaper is my <hi rend="italic">creed</hi> –and ne<lb break="no"/>ver will I again travel without my faith along with <lb/>me : having fully experienced the unpleasantness <lb/>of being sent back into the world as ignorant as <lb/>if I had been born again– <hi rend="italic">I hereby give notice</hi> – <lb/>"That if an <hi rend="italic">hottentot</hi>  friend of mine invites me, <lb/>who does not take in your paper or some other– <lb/>I will not visit him." <hi rend="smallcaps">DICK DESPERATE</hi>.</p>
