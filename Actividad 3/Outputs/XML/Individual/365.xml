                <p><pb n="2"/>Each day brings additional strength to the re<lb break="no"/>port of a rupture with America. The represent<lb break="no"/>tations which have been very forcibly urged by the American Minister, Mr. Pickney, include various <lb/>topics of complaint. Amongst these are, the with<lb break="no"/>holding of the poste of Niagara, Detroit, &amp;c. in <lb/>violation of the treat of 1783; the exciting of <lb/>of the Creek and other Indians to make compen<lb break="no"/>sation for the property seized by the armies under <lb/>Lord Cornwalis, &amp; in the Southern States, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to stipulation; the seizure of American <lb/>ships bound to France; the impressing of Ameri<lb break="no"/>can citizens to man our fleets; and finally, the <lb/>sullen silence which the British Minister is alledg<lb break="no"/>ed to have uniformly maintained on the subject of <lb/>the claims made by the Republic.</p>
                <p>The American Minister has, however, so little <lb/>hope of efficacy from these representations, that <lb/>he has ordered in his tradesmen's bills, and made <lb/>every other preparation for an abrupt departure.</p>
                <p>Not withstanding this alarming aspect of affairs, <lb/>we still must hope, that no consequences subversive <lb/>of the pacific system at present subsisting between <lb/>American and Great Britain will ensue; for ill-<lb break="no"/>judged and ignorant, indeed, of the true interests <lb/>of his country must that Briton be (whatever his <lb/>rank) who would advise another American war <lb/>â€“a war which, reasoning of the future by the <lb/>sorrowful experience of the past, can only serve to <lb/>increase the sum, and to swell the catalogue of <lb/>human woes.</p>
