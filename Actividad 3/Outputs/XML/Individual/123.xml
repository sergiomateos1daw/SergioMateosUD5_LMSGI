                <p><pb/>Extract of a letter from the agent to <lb/>at the Cape of Good Hope, dated 15th Nov. <lb/>1817: –</p>
                <p>"The following most daring instance of piracy <lb/>was committed in our harbour on the 11th inst. <lb/>viz.– The Elizabeth, White, lying at anchor off <lb/>Robin Island, with about 120 tons of oil on board, <lb/>was boarded at about one <hi rend="smallcaps">a. m.</hi>  by a party of <lb/>armed deserters from his Majesty's 10th regi<lb break="no"/>ment, and convicts, about 12 in number, <hi rend="italic">i. e. </hi><lb/>five soldiers and seven convicts, who, after se<lb break="no"/>curing the hatches, &amp;c. obtained possession of <lb/>the ship, and in the same instant cut the cables, <lb/>loosed the sails, and favoured by a strong S. E. <lb/>wind, succeeded in carrying her off, at six <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m. </hi><lb/>The captain and crew having refused to listen to <lb/>their invitation to join them in their piratical un<lb break="no"/>dertaking, with the exception of the mate, were <lb/>permitted to leave the ship in the boat, which <lb/>reached Robin Island in safety about four o'clock <lb/>the same day.</p>
                <p>"By a letter received to-day we learn that <lb/>the Admiral Gambier, Brash, laden with Govern<lb break="no"/>ment stores for Ceylon, was totally lost on the <lb/>morning of the 20th of June last, having struck <lb/>on the reef Roan de Nova, in the Mozambique <lb/>Channel ; crew saved."</p>
                <p>A letter from Halifax, dated the 27th No<lb break="no"/>nember, says – " Colonel Bouchette, Surveyor - <lb/>General of Lower Canada, with Captain Camp<lb break="no"/>bell, of the 60th regiment, and Mr Bouchette, <lb/>jun. arrived here on the 19th inst. The only in<lb break="no"/>formation I can yet give you is, that the exploring <lb/>survey has been extended from the source of the <lb/>St Croix river to the river Restigouche, in line <lb/>about 100 miles ; in this short distance both par<lb break="no"/>ties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the <lb/>severest nature. The Americans employed on <lb/>the same line with our English Commissioners <lb/>are represented as men of great ability, and act<lb break="no"/>ing with that spirit of liberality that infuses con<lb break="no"/>fidence on each side, rendering their arduous <lb/>task less severe and gloomy than was to have <lb/>been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this <lb/>quarter. Our trade continues dull, and money <lb/>scarce. Government bills are 3 per cent ad<lb break="no"/>vance, but expected to be lower, in consequence <lb/>of the Commissary-General having refused to <lb/>take the provincial notes."</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard</hi> –On Friday <lb/>night, about half-past nine o'clock, this place <lb/>was thrown into the greatest consternation, by <lb/>the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard, <lb/>the beating of drums, and the firing of the men <lb/>of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire hav<lb break="no"/>ing broken out in the house belonging to the <lb/>steam engine erected for carrying on the new <lb/>works situated in the southern part of the dock - <lb/>yard, near the kilns used for burning cement <lb/>stone. The most serious apprehensions were <lb/>entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and <lb/>what was more distressing to the feelings of the <lb/>spectators, was its coniguity to the workhouse, <lb/>which, from the pressure of the times and want <lb/>of employment, is crowded with many unfortu<lb break="no"/>nate individuals. Providence, however, averted <lb/>the impending danger, and about twelve o'clock <lb/>we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames <lb/>subdued, with only the loss of the engine-house. <lb/>No lives, it is understood, have been lost, but <lb/>one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker <lb/>of the Northumberland, and the officers of that <lb/>ship, Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter, and <lb/>Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary, <lb/>with the military officers and soldiers of the gar<lb break="no"/>rison, assembled on the first alarm. The latter <lb/>were under arms the whole time, and were of <lb/>great service in keeping off the spectators. The <lb/>inhabitants of the twon were at one time under <lb/>serious apprehensions, as the fire was not far <lb/>from the Fountain tavern, and the residence of <lb/>Mr Miller, in High Street. At the former, the <lb/>landlady of the house had but recently lain in, <lb/>and was removed on the first alarm being given. <lb/>Sir Robert Barlow, from Chatham, who superin<lb break="no"/>tends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle, <lb/>was here yesterday to investiage into the cause, <lb/>which it is suspected arose from carlessness – <lb/>The damage, however, has not been so great as <lb/>was at first expected, and which it might have been <lb/>but for the prompt and effectual assistance that <lb/>was given – <hi rend="italic">Sheerness, January</hi>  11</p>
