                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Reform in Upper Canada</hi></p>
                <p>It has been already mentioned that Governor <lb/>Maitland, on opening the session of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature of Upper Canada, recommended that mea<lb break="no"/>sures should be taken to prevent the meeting <lb/>of delegates for obtaining reform in Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>da. Accounts from Quebec and Montreal, da<lb break="no"/>ted the end of November, state, that in pursu<lb break="no"/>ance of this recommendation, the Legislature, <lb/>on one of the first days of its meeting, appoint<lb break="no"/>ed a Committee to inquire into the subject, who <lb/>almost instantly came to the following resolu<lb break="no"/>tion</p>
                <p>Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Committee that <lb/>some such legislative provision should be enacted as the wis<lb break="no"/>dom of the Imperial Parliament has found it proper to pro<lb break="no"/>vide to meet similar occasions, to put it out of the power of <lb/>any designing persons to organize discontent.</p>
                <p>The proceeding appears to have raised the in<lb break="no"/>dignation of the Gourlay or reforming party in <lb/>Upper Canada, as will be seen by the following <lb/>extract :â€“</p>
                <p>Montreal, November 21. <lb/>This legislative provision, it will be immediate<lb break="no"/> <lb/>ly perceived, is the suspension of the Habeas <lb/>Corpus act, for that was the course pursued in <lb/>England. We do not believe that there is the <lb/>most remote necessity for such a measure. We <lb/>do not hesitate to say, that the members have <lb/>not spoken the sentiments of heir constituents, <lb/>in their echo of Sir P. Maitland's speech, with <lb/>the most humiliating servility ; and we feel con<lb break="no"/>vinced that it will not be borne with by the <lb/>people, while they have the control in any way <lb/>of their representatives. The sentiment therein <lb/>attempted to be disseminated is an <pb/>libel on the truly loyal people of Upper Canada. <lb/>It would sound in our ears like the knell of their <lb/>liberty, if we were not persuaded, that its adop<lb break="no"/>tion would provoke a spirit of resistance, not <lb/>corporal, but mental ; not secret and illegal, but <lb/>open and legitimate, which (if the Administra<lb break="no"/>tion do not take the decision of the question <lb/>from the people by force, and we believe they <lb/>cannot nor dare not) will serve to purge the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the united province from the injury <lb/>which it has received by mal-administration.</p>
