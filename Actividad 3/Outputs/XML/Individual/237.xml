                <p>The following document has just been issued from the <lb/>Colonial Office:–</p>
                <p>Downing street, April 6, 1834. <lb/>Numerous applicants have been received from per<lb break="no"/>sons desirous of emigrating to New South Wales or Van <lb/>Dieman's Land, who, after stating their inability to de<lb break="no"/>fray the whole charge of their conveyance, solicit aid <lb/>for that purpose, on condition of repaying the same out <lb/>of their earnings in the colony where they propose to <lb/>settle. His Majesty's government has sanctioned the <lb/>appropriate of a limited sum out of the colonial reve<lb break="no"/>nues of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, to <lb/>assist the private funds of such emigrants as may ap<lb break="no"/>pear likely to earn the means of repayig that aid, and <lb/>to become useful settlers. The following are the re<lb break="no"/>gulations under which this induglence will be dispens<lb break="no"/>ed:–</p>
                <p>No advance will be made except to young and mar<lb break="no"/>ried agricultural labourers, who intend taking their <lb/>wives and families with them : and a strict inquiry will <lb/>be instituted into their character and habits of industry, <lb/>before the assistance they solicit will be granted to them.</p>
                <p>No one family will be allowed an advance exceeding <lb/>t20; and it will be useful therefore for parties, who <lb/>may not possess the remainder of the sum requisite for <lb/>defraying the expense of their passage, to apply for as<lb break="no"/>sistance.</p>
                <p>Every person desirous of receiving the proposed ad<lb break="no"/>vance must fill up, and send back to the Under Secre<lb break="no"/>tary of State for the Colonial Department, the return <lb/>hereto annexed. If the information contained in this <lb/>return, and the answers to the inquiries which may be <lb/>addressed to the parties who certify the correctness of <lb/>the return, shall be considered satisfactory, the appli<lb break="no"/>cant will receive notice to that effect. He may then <lb/>proceed to make his agreement with the owners or <lb/>masters of ships proceeding to New South Wales or <lb/>Van Diemen's land, and as soon as any ship-owner <lb/>or master shall notify (in a form which will be provided <lb/>for that purpose) that the emigrant has taken the other <lb/>necessary steps for engaging his passage, and order will <lb/>be granted for the payment in the colony, of t20 to the <lb/>agent or master of the vessel in which this emigrant <lb/>may arrive. The emigrant will of course be able to[?] ob-[?] <lb/>tain a corresponding deduction from the amount[?] [?] <lb/>paid by himself in this country.</p>
                <p>The order for payment will be entrusted [?] <lb/>ter of the vessel in which the emigrants to pro[?] <lb/>and will consist of a sealed dispatch to the governor, <lb/>containing the name and description of the party on <lb/>whose account the money is to be paid, and encolosing a <lb/>promissory note, which he will be required to sign in <lb/>acknowledgement of his debt ; which note must be wit<lb break="no"/>nessed by the captain and chief mate of the vessel. But <lb/>arrangements will be made, by which the payment of <lb/>this order will not take place in the colony until the <lb/>captain shall have produced the parties, on whose ac<lb break="no"/>count it is to be made, before the officer appointed for <lb/>that purpose, and they shall have entered into a fresh <lb/>obligation for the repayment of the advance made to <lb/>them. For it is the intention of his Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and cannot be too clearly understoof by all per<lb break="no"/>sons who may accept this loan, that repayments of the <lb/>debt (in such proportions and at such intervals as may <lb/>not be unsuitable to the circumstances of each emi<lb break="no"/>grant) shall be strictly enforced, by means of the ample <lb/>powers which the laws of the colony render available <lb/>for that purpose.</p>
                <p>Government agents for emigration have been appoint<lb break="no"/>ed at Liverpool, Bristol, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Bel<lb break="no"/>fast, and Greenock, who have been instructed to afford <lb/>gratuitous information to all persons applying to them <lb/>as to the best means of carrying their schemes of emi<lb break="no"/>gration into effect. Parties, therefore, who may reside <lb/>in the neighbourhood of these agents are requested to <lb/>apply to them either personally (or if by letter post <lb/>paid) for information on this subject.</p>
                <p>All application for the assistance of government must <lb/>be made by letter only, addressed to R. W. Hay, Esq. <lb/>Under Secretary of State, London ; and should the <lb/>number of applications be greater than the funds at <lb/>their disposal will enable them to comply with, priority <lb/>of date will form the rule of selection among applications <lb/>in which there shall appear no other groun of distinc<lb break="no"/>tion. <hi rend="smallcaps">W. R. Hay.</hi></p>
