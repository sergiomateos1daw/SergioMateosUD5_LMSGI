               <hi rend="center">QUESAS ISLANDS.  <lb/>[From the <hi rend="italic">Sydney Gazette</hi>, November 8, 1815.] </hi>
               <lb/>
            </p>
                <p>By the <hi rend="italic">Governor Macquarrie</hi>  are arrived Captain Fow<lb break="no"/>ler, and part of the crew of the India brig <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi>, which <lb/>sailed from this colony in August, 1813, bound on a voy<lb break="no"/>age to the Derwent and Eastern Islands, and from thence <lb/>to China; but was cut off and plundered on the night of <lb/>the 10th of April last, while lying at anchor in Duff's <lb/>Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah, one of the Marquesas, <lb/>on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomoo<lb break="no"/>too men) had previously deserted, and joining with some <lb/>of the Rooapoah natives, took the opportunity of a dark <lb/>night, and the wind blowing fresh right on the land, to cut <lb/>the vessel adrift; by which means she drove ashore <lb/>through a heavy surf, and was soon bilged and filled with <lb/>water. When the cannibal natives saw that it was im<lb break="no"/>practicable to get the vessel afloat, they concurred univer<lb break="no"/>sally in the design of putting the whole of her crew to <lb/>death; which appears to have been a constant practise <lb/>among the different natives towards one another, when <lb/>their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore, through <lb/>stress of weather, or from any other accident.</p>
                <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their <lb/>Chief, or King, Nooahetu, who presided at the horrible tri<lb break="no"/>bunal that had devoted the unfortunate mariners to in<lb break="no"/>stant slaughter. He withheld his assent to the murder; <lb/>but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of the ves<lb break="no"/>sel. The crew were informed by such expressions as <lb/>they could understand, as well as by gesticulations that <lb/>accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion, that <lb/>their lives were dependent on the issue; the good Chief <lb/>was opposed by many other Chiefs, who, though somewhat <lb/>inferior in rank, were very far superior in number, support<lb break="no"/>ed by the common usages of the island, from which the <lb/>exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. <lb/>He was seated, with his son by his side, on a mat in his <lb/>own dwelling: he had been called to the supremacy of the <lb/>island by the general wish of the people, as it was not a <lb/>hereditary right, but an elective dignity. His people pressed <lb/>their solicitations earnestly, and at length peremptorily <lb/>demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length <lb/>of time opposed by the force of words, which not seem<lb break="no"/>ing likely to prevail, he adopted a method which si<lb break="no"/>lenced the whole in an instant, and saved the lives of <lb/>Captain Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his <lb/>expostulations were defeated upon the principle of un<lb break="no"/>deviating custom, he deliberately took up two ropes that <lb/>were near him, and fixing one round the neck of his son, <lb/>and the other round his own, called to the Chief next in <lb/>command, who immediately approached him. His con<lb break="no"/>ference was short and decisive; he first pointed to the cord <lb/>that encircled the neck of his son, and then to the other, <lb/>which he had entwined around his own. "These strangers <lb/>are doomed to death," said he, "by my chiefs and my <lb/>people, and it is not fit that I, who am their King, should <lb/>live to see so vile a deed perpetrated. Let my child and <lb/>myself be strangled before it is performed; and then it <lb/>never will be said that we sanctioned, even with our eye - <lb/>sight, the destruction of these unoffending people."</p>
                <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less <lb/>than produce, even in the mind of the unenlightened savage, <lb/>a paroxysm of surprise, mingled with a sentiment of ad<lb break="no"/>miration in which the untaught man may possibly excel <lb/>his fellow creature, whose conceptions are moulded by <lb/>tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of pas<lb break="no"/>sion. For a moment the people looked wildly upon their <lb/>King, whose person they adored, because that his prin<lb break="no"/>ciples were good, and his government just and mild. <lb/>They saw the obedient chief, to whom the order of <lb/>strangulation had been imparted, staring with horror <lb/>and amazement at the change which a few moments <lb/>had produced; the mandate that had proceeded from <lb/>the King's own lips must be obeyed;and commanded to <lb/>perform the dreadful office, he proceeded to obey–when a <lb/>sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. <lb/>"The King! the King!" from every lip burst forth:– <lb/>"What! kill the King! No, no, let all the strangers live <lb/>–no man shall kill the King!" Thus were their lives <lb/>preserved and the vessel plundered of every thing on <lb/>board her.</p>
                <p>The floor of the <hi rend="italic">Greenwich</hi>, which was burnt at Nooa<lb break="no"/>heva, still remains, and is dry at low water. All her iron <lb/>and copper have been taken out by the natives, who have <lb/>a thorough knowledge of the use of these materials. That <lb/>they are cannibals is well ascertained. They form dis<lb break="no"/>tinct factions, and make war upon the ruling Chief; the <lb/>rebels are denominated the Typees; and the opposing par<lb break="no"/>ties are horribly sanguinary towards each. Six of the ad<lb break="no"/>verse party were killed, and devoured by the rebels while <lb/>Captain Fowler was among them, and the following de<lb break="no"/>testable circumstance occurred on the occasion:–A native <lb/>man belonging to Port Anna Maria, who was not tattooed, <lb/>and in consequence prohibited from the eating of human <lb/>flesh, on pain of death, impatient of the restraint, fell upon <lb/>one of the murdered bodies, and darting his teeth into it in <lb/>all the madness of a voracious fury, exhaled the crimson <lb/>moisture, which had not yet coagulated.</p>
                <p>The Chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very friendly to <lb/>Europeans, is named Ke-atta-nooe, the first part of the <lb/>name implying the outrigger of a canoe, and the latter <lb/>signifying great. The dress, of the men consists merely <lb/>of a wrapper about the waist; the women are covered <lb/>from the shoulders downwards to the ancles, and are gene<lb break="no"/>rally fairer than the Taheitan women. The Chiefs have <lb/>no distinguishing mark or ornament, but in the mode of <lb/>wearing their hair; which the common orders wear <lb/>tied up in a large knot on each side of the head, a stripe <lb/>of which, extending from the forehead to the hollow of the <lb/>neck, is kept shorn, which practice the Chiefs do not <lb/>adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the worms to be more <lb/>prevalent and destructive to the ships' bottoms there, than he <lb/>has anywhere else witnessed; and to this cause attributes the <lb/>caution of the natives in drawing up their largest canoes, <lb/>some of which contain from 80 to 100 warriors. They <lb/>are anxious after every kind of property carried among <lb/>them for barter, and this is supposed their chief induce<lb break="no"/>ment for attacking vessels when they can do so with a <lb/>probability of accomplishing their object. They have <lb/>no knowledge of the use of muskets, and have none <lb/>among them except a few at Port Anna Maria. A gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, at this time in Sydney, who resided among them <lb/>about 15 years ago in a missionary capacity, describes <lb/>them as a people constantly employing their thoughts on <lb/>plunder, and devising schemes for taking advantage of <cb/>strangers. Their population is very numerous; which he <lb/>remarked to some of them, to whom he gave a description <lb/>of Otaheite, observing, at the same time, that its inhabit<lb break="no"/>ants were less numerous:–"Cannot we go and take <lb/>them? What is there to hinder us?"–was immediately de<lb break="no"/>manded. This anecdote we notice as a specimen of their <lb/>natural inclination to hostility, in which, all accounts re<lb break="no"/>specting them correspond.</p>
