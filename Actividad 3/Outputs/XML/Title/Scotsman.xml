               <hi rend="smallcaps">Convicts destined for Botany Bay.</hi> –It is now seven <lb/>weeks since the ten Derby convicts were sent off with several <lb/>others, whose destination for the rest of their lives is Botany <lb/>Bay. They were, upon landing at Sheerness from the Retri<lb break="no"/>bution, put on board the Tottenham, which was engaged to <lb/>land them at their place of punishment. The number on <lb/>board that ship, on leaving Sheerness, was between 2 to 300, <lb/>many of whom were diseased and infirm. Their condition has <lb/>been rendered most intolerable from an unaccountable delay <lb/>that has taken place. The ship Tottenham had not proceed<lb break="no"/>ed farther than the Downs when she lost her rudder, by some <lb/>accident or other. She returned to Sheerness, where she now <lb/>lies, and where she is likely to lie for some time, upon the pre<lb break="no"/>tence that the loss she has sustained is a justification for delay, <lb/>however protracted. The unfortunate inmates have been led <lb/>to expect that some important mitigation of their sentence has <lb/>taken place ;–so that between the suspense, and the terrible <lb/>species of confinement to which they are subject, their suffer<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ings are hardto be described.– <hi rend="italic">Observer.</hi>

                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">The Hon. Lieut.-Colonel Erskine.</hi> –It is with the great<lb break="no"/>est concern we have to mentioned the death of Lieut.-Colonel <lb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Erskine,</hi>  Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Erskine's</hi>  youngest son, on his passage to <lb/>Ceylon. He served throughout the campaigns in Spain as <lb/>a Captain of Light Infantry in the 51st regiment, and be<lb break="no"/>haved with great gallantry in the battle of the Pyrenees, <lb/>where being shot in the thigh he was sent home by the Medi<lb break="no"/>cal Board, and on his recovery was placed by the Duke of <lb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">York</hi>  on the Staff of the Army in the Adjutant-General's <lb/>Department when the Duke of <hi rend="smallcaps">Wellington</hi>  took the com<lb break="no"/>mand in Flanders. He was in the battle of the 16th of June, <lb/>and afterwards on the 18th at the battle of Waterloo, where <lb/>his station placed him in the dangerous position of being at<lb break="no"/>tendant on the Duke, around whom almost every officer was <lb/>either killed or wounded. Amongst the rest this brave young <lb/>man had his left arm carried off by a cannon-ball, which pass<lb break="no"/>ing along the other laid bare the whole of it, by which he lost <lb/>the use of two of his fingers, but that arm was saved. When <lb/>the cannon-shot had thrown him from his horse, and as he lay <lb/>bleeding upon the groun in this mangled condition, the Prus<lb break="no"/>sian musketry and trumpets being heard at a distance, he sei<lb break="no"/>zed his hat with his remaining shattered arm. and waving it <lb/>round him cheered his companions in the midst of the dying <lb/>and the dead, the Duke of <hi rend="smallcaps">Wellington</hi>  being then close by <lb/>him who desired he might carried to his tent.</p>
                <p>It must be some consolation to his afflicted family, that he <lb/>must have distinguished himself in the opinion of his great <lb/>Commander, as he was immediately recommended by him for <lb/>the rank of Major, though a very young officer, and in a year <lb/>afterwards to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, with the ap<lb break="no"/>pointment of Adjutant-General in Ceylon, and if he had then <lb/>fortunately sailed for India his life might probably have been <lb/>saved ; but his disposition being as affectionate as it was ani<lb break="no"/>mated, he could not be persuaded to leave Mrs <hi rend="smallcaps">Erskine</hi>, who <lb/>was pregnant, and remaining here during the winter, the <lb/>cough, with consumptive symptoms, arising from his wound, <lb/>laid too deep a hold on him to derive benefit from the voyage, <lb/>and he died on his passage to India.</p>
                <p>Colonel <hi rend="smallcaps">Erskine</hi>  was only 25 years of age, and has left three <lb/>sons and a daughter, and an infant a few months old.</p>
                <p>The marriage of the Duke of <hi rend="smallcaps">Clarence</hi>  with the rich heir<lb break="no"/>ess Miss <hi rend="smallcaps">Wykeham</hi>  is said to be finally arranged ; and from <lb/>what we observe, it is not likely to suffer any delay from the <lb/>late domestic calamity. it is said that the <hi rend="smallcaps">Prince Regent </hi>
               <lb/>has given his own personal assent ; but whether it has passed <lb/>through the constitutional forms, and that the <hi rend="italic">Royal Assent in </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">Council</hi>  has been given we do not pretend to know. It must <lb/>have that sanction to secure the Lady the right, for herself <lb/>and heirs, of succeeding to the Throne. On this interesting <lb/>subject it cannot be forgotten, that <hi rend="smallcaps">King</hi>  in Council re<lb break="no"/>fused his assent in three former instances.</p>
                <p>The refusal of the Princess Royal of <hi rend="smallcaps">Denmark</hi>  arrived in <lb/>town on Monday or Tuesday last week. On Wednesday it <lb/>was communicated to his Royal Highness the Duke of <hi rend="smallcaps">Cla<lb break="no"/>rence</hi>, and on Thursday he set off to Brighton, offered his <lb/>hand to Miss <hi rend="smallcaps">Wykeham</hi>, and " was a thriving wooer."</p>
                <p>Colonel <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry Fitzclarence</hi>, the son of the Duke of <hi rend="smallcaps">Cla<lb break="no"/>rence</hi>, lately deceased, was a young man of uncommon ener<lb break="no"/>gy of character, and of talents and acquirements. In the af<lb break="no"/>fair of the 10th Light Dragoons, he displayed a spirit of inde<lb break="no"/>pendence and manliness the most honourable. He was an ad<lb break="no"/>mirable linguist, and, as we understand, was about to return <lb/>to England, with the view of being employed in the Diploma<lb break="no"/>cy, for which he was peculiarly qualified.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Leeds, </hi>
               <hi rend="italic">April</hi>  19.–We have been somewhat alarmed here <lb/>to-day, though no bad consequences have followed, by a most <lb/>numerous assemblage of croppers, cloth-dressers, and other <lb/>artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep com<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ing in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley, Arm<lb break="no"/>ley, Holbeck, and all the neighbouring towns and villages <lb/>and it is computed that at one time there were full three <lb/>thousand of these distressed people assembled, chiefly in Brig<lb break="no"/>gate. As many of them marched into the town with great <lb/>sticks in their hands, they created some little alarm, but their <lb/>conduct was uniformly peaceable; their complaints were not <lb/>loud, though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and <lb/>Magistrates, with the whole of the Civil Power, were in rea<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>diness to act as circumstances might require; but, fortunately, <lb/>there was not the slightest occasion for their interference. <lb/>By far the greater number of the assemblage dispersed by noon, <lb/>and returned to their respective homes. Several respectable <lb/>gentlemen went among them, to ascertain the motives of <lb/>their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it does not ap<lb break="no"/>pear that they have the least disposition to commit any breath <lb/>of the peace ; but in fact, the people know not what to do <lb/>in their present state of distress. I understand that an active <lb/>subscription is going, to enable a number of these poor <lb/>men to proceed to Canada; and others are said to have ex<lb break="no"/>pressed their wish to be sent to Botany Bay, provided they <lb/>can obtain the sanction of Government. The case of these <lb/>people is a very perplexing one ; for their numbers augment <lb/>daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Chester, </hi>
               <hi rend="italic">April</hi>  19.–John Bagguely, John Drummond <lb/>and Samuel Johnson, convicted of sedition on the 15th inst., <lb/>were this day, after an adrdress from the Chief-Justice (Mr <lb/>Serjeant Copley,) sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and <lb/>to find security for their good behaviour for two years, each <lb/>in L.500 himself with sureties in L.100 each.</p>
                <p>We are sorry to hear that great number of the agricultu<lb break="no"/>ral poor are out of employ in Monmouthshire, and that the <lb/>amount of wages diminishes as works get scarcer. Emigra<lb break="no"/>tion to America still continues; but it is, for the most part, of <lb/>a description of person who have afforded employ to others <lb/>rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some <lb/>property with them.</p>
                <p>Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States, there <lb/>are twenty six persons belonging to one family, (Quakers, of <lb/>the name of Thistlewaith,) lately residing in Meadow lane, <lb/>Leeds. These industrious and enterprising individuals are <lb/>gone with an intention of carrying on the woollen manufac<lb break="no"/>ture (in conjunction with others) on an extensive scale, ei<lb break="no"/>ther at Philadelphia or some other more eligible site in its <lb/>vicinity. Several other families are preparing to emigrate <lb/>from the same neighbourhood, as well as from Dewsbury, <lb/>Bradford, and other places in the vicinity. It is true these <lb/>extensive emigrations may, in some degree, contribute to re<lb break="no"/>lieve our overburdened population ; but they must likewise <lb/>tend, in an equal ratio, to impoverish the nation ; as every <lb/>individual and family who emigrate, setting aside the pecu<lb break="no"/>niary wealth they carry with them, take what is of far more <lb/>consequence to a commercial nation–their talents and in<lb break="no"/>dustry–articles, at present, of comparative small value in the <lb/>country.</p>
                <p>The very heavy impost which is at present levied upon au<lb break="no"/>thors and publishers, by being compelled, under the existing <lb/>Copyright Act to deliver eleven copies of every book publish<lb break="no"/>ed to certain public libraries, is likely to be repealed by a Bill <lb/>to be brought into Parliament in a few days. The body of <lb/>evidence taken before the Select Committe of the House of <lb/>Commons last year, forms a most interesting display of the <lb/>state of literary property in this country.</p>
                <p>Saturday last Mr Stuart and Mr Allsop were returned for <lb/>the Borough of Camelford.</p>
                <p>Yesterday, the Grand Jury for the County of Middlesex <lb/>found two Bills of Indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury <lb/>against five of the principal witnesses produced in behalf of <lb/>the petitioner, who were examined before the Select Com<lb break="no"/>mittee appointed to try the merits of the election fo Penrhyn.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Extraordinary Legacy.</hi> –A very singular cause is now de<lb break="no"/>pending before the Court of Session in Scotland, respecting a <lb/>legacy to the amount of upwards of <hi rend="italic">fifty thousand pounds,</hi> be<lb break="no"/>queathed by the late Earl of F. (who died at Berlin) to a fo<lb break="no"/>reigner, who was one of his domestic servants. The payment <lb/>of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the late Earl, <lb/>on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consi<lb break="no"/>deration ; and from its novelty the case is, of course, the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of much conversation in the Northern Metropolis. The <lb/>arguments and pleadings in this extraordinary suit, in which <lb/>the most eminent counsel of the Edinburgh Bar are engaged, <lb/>display much classical as well as legal learning ; but no judg<lb break="no"/>ement has yet been pronounced by the Court. From the mag<lb break="no"/>nitude of the sum in dispute, it will probably be finally de<lb break="no"/>termined by an appeal to the House of Lords.– <hi rend="italic">Morn. Chron.</hi>

               <hi rend="italic">Town Hall, Southwark.</hi> –Thomas Wing was brought up by <lb/>Reeve, the Marshalman, and examined before Sir John Earner[?], <lb/>the sitting Magistrate, charged on suspicion of robbing his em<lb break="no"/>ployers, Messrs Sentance and Flint, grocers, NO. 300. Borough, <lb/>High-street.</p>
                <p>The prisoner's detection was caused in the following singu<lb break="no"/>lar manner :–He was porter to the prosecutors, and was fre<lb break="no"/>quently about the shop ; a large house dog having seen him <lb/>take money from the till, which he tied in his pocket hand<lb break="no"/>kerchief, followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a <lb/>shed near the stables, and then he came into the shop and ap<lb break="no"/>peared quite restless, pulling every person by the skirt[?] and <lb/>apparently wishing them to follow him. At length Henry <lb/>Heydon, the apprentice, having occasion to go to the stable, <lb/>the dog followed him, and having drawn his attention to the <lb/>heap of rubbish, under which the money was buried, began to <lb/>scratch at it till he brought the booty to view ! The appren<lb break="no"/>tice brought it to his master, who counted, and found it to <lb/>contain 12s. in copper coin. After marking it he desired the <lb/>boy to place it in the same spot, which he did, and soon af<lb break="no"/>terwards, finding that it was removed, he asked the prisoner <lb/>some questions about it, but he declared his ignorance of the <lb/>whole transaction. Reeve, the Marshalman, was then sent <lb/>for, who, on searching the prisoner, found some of the marked <lb/>ballpence[?] in his pocket.–Remanded. <cb/>
               <hi rend="italic">Bank Committee.</hi> –The Opposition Journals, last wek, as<lb break="no"/>serted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House of <lb/>Commons intend to report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of <lb/>paying in specie. That is, the Bank shall pay next January <lb/>in gold bars at the present price of gold, L.4 1s. per ounce, <lb/>any quanitity of notes not being less than sixty or a hundred <lb/>pounds' worth, and that in two years afterwards they shall <lb/>pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold, L.3, 17s. <lb/>10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's plan goes farther. It re<lb break="no"/>commends that the Bank shall never pay in coin, but in bars <lb/>of gold, at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall <lb/>at all times buy gold, when offered, at L.3, 17s. and sell it, <lb/>when demanded, at L.3, 17s. 10 1/2d.</p>
                <p>If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the <lb/>Restriction Committee intend to report in favour of payments <lb/>in bullion at the market price ; and should Parliament adopt <lb/>that plan ; then there will be a very great saving to the na<lb break="no"/>tion in the expense of coinage, the waste of, &amp;c. All <lb/>the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in fo<lb break="no"/>reign commerce, will be answered as well by payments in gold <lb/>bars as by payments in coins, and the danger of a domestic run <lb/>on the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic, as in 1797, <lb/>will be completely prevented. This is, indeed, at all times, <lb/>the only danger to which it is exposed. A run for coin on <lb/>the Country Banks would instantly fall on the Bank of England, <lb/>and would cramp, if not dry up,the currency throughout the <lb/>empire, producing the greatest confusion. Now, if the Op<lb break="no"/>position Journals be correct, the currency will be placed in <lb/>perfect security, at perfect ease. Nothing will be able to dis<lb break="no"/>order it. If persons will hoard specie, they must purchase <lb/>gold bars or foreign coin, or content themselves with silver.</p>
                <p>In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the <lb/>amount of L.800,000 each year, and then the value of gold <lb/>was rather below the standard price. In the year 1817 we <lb/>imported to the amount of six millions, and in the year 1818 <lb/>we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. Du<lb break="no"/>ring the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have <lb/>an abundant harvest or two, and little importation of corn <lb/>become necessary, gold will again fall very low. The Bank <lb/>will then be able to pay, to buy gold to the full extent of Mr <lb/>Ricardo's plan, and to place their notes on a firm, unques<lb break="no"/>tionable foundation. The finances of the continent, and of <lb/>the world, indeed–the sources and circulation of money will, <lb/>during peace, gradually become steadier and better known. <lb/>The East Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quan<lb break="no"/>tity of specie, while Spanish America, in consequence of her <lb/>troubles, yields far less than usual. It would be madness to <lb/>fly in the face of all these circumstances, by compelling the <lb/>Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may be desirable to li<lb break="no"/>mit the issue of bank notes to some certain, yet liberal amount. <lb/>We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the Committee ; <lb/>but, if some rumours be true, we augur favourably of it. It[?] <lb/>is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee, and stood alone in <lb/>voting against the Report. Thus, then, the Report cannot be <lb/>in favour of a very sudden or decided plan for the resumpion <lb/>of cash payments, or Mr Tierney would not have voted against <lb/>it ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable prospect of a rational <lb/>scheme for that resumption, or the other five or six Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion Members of the Committee would not have voted for it. <lb/>– <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Grand Pigeon Match</hi>, three Gentlemen of the Midgham <lb/>Club, against thrice of All England, took place on Monday on <lb/>Farnham Downs, at twenty-one birds, twenty-one yards dis<lb break="no"/>tance from the gun, for 150 guineas aside, charge unlimited. <lb/>Messrs Adams, Russel and Holt, were selected from the Crack <lb/>Club against Messrs King, Short and Keans. The sports were <lb/>as follows ; Mr Adams killed nineteen birds, and the remain<lb break="no"/>ing two were severely hit. Russel killed eighteen, but lost <lb/>one three yards out of bounds, and Mr Holt bagged sixteen, <lb/>making a grand total of fifty-two from sixty-three. The Club <lb/>was at first backed to win, but the England shots were now <lb/>backed freely at six to four, as they were considered safe <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">eighteen</hi>  bird men. Mr King killed twenty, but lost two out <lb/>of bounds. Short missed his first three, which brought bet<lb break="no"/>ting to two to one onn the Club, but he killed the next seven<lb break="no"/>teen, and missed the last bird. Mr Keans had seventeen to <lb/>tie, and eighteen to win, and he was back at five to four <lb/>and at two to one, after killing eleven birds in succession. <lb/>He, however, missed the seventeenth, and had to kill the o<lb break="no"/>ther four to win. He succeeded, and the prize was won by once <lb/>bird. It was altogether the most interesting match of this <lb/>sort known for years.</p>
                <p>Letters from Petersburgh, of the 15th ultimo, mention that <lb/>Prince Gustavus of Sweden, son of King Gustavus IV., has <lb/>obtained permission from the Emperor, his uncle, to proceed <lb/>to England, for the purpose of completing his studies at Ox<lb break="no"/>ford. Reports speak highly of the virtues and talents of this <lb/>unfortunate young Prince, who excites universal interest and <lb/>sympathy in the north of Europe. In these feelings we must <lb/>largely share, for we cannot easily forget the associations with <lb/>which the name of <hi rend="italic">Vasa</hi>  was connected, not the services ren<lb break="no"/>dered by two Sovereigns of that Illustrious House to the cause <lb/>of civil and religious liberty. It is said that a great Potentate, <lb/>whose generosity and magnanimity are proverbial, has settled <lb/>upon Prince Gustavus an allowance of L. 2,000 Sterling per <lb/>annum, during the residence of the latter in England, and that <lb/>on the return of his Royal Highness to the Continent he is <lb/>to espouse his cousin, a Princess of Hesse Cassel, who, if ru<lb break="no"/>mour be correct, has lately refused a matrimonial alliance <lb/>with the new Swedish dynasty.</p>
                <p>Papers arrivedon Saturday from New York and Boston to <lb/>the 15th ult. The National Intelligencer, in an article occu<lb break="no"/>pying five columns, under the head of "Strictures on Mr La<lb break="no"/>cock's Report on the Seminole War," defends the sanguinary <lb/>proceedings of General Jackson. This production is said to <lb/>have excited a great sensation throughout the United States, <lb/>being supposed to express the sentiments of the Executive. <lb/>The General had left Washington for his residence in Tenes<lb break="no"/>see. By an arrival from Aux Cayes, intelligence was stated <lb/>to be received that Sir G M'Gregor's troops had deserted <lb/>him, owing to the want of funds for their subsistence.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Birkbeck's Settlement</hi>
            </p>
                <p>A small pamphlet has lately been published, consisting of letters <lb/>and extracts of letters from Mr Birkbeck, of which we have been procured <lb/>a copy. The author's object appears chiefly to have been to counter<lb break="no"/>act the misrepresentations circulated on the subject of the settlement <lb/>by Cobbett. We read Cobbett's remarks when they were first trans<lb break="no"/>mitted to this country, and certainly did not think them worthy of the <lb/>notice here bestowed upon them. His objections to the new settle<lb break="no"/>ment, helped out as they were misquotation and misconstruction, <lb/>were of very little weight, except in so far as they applied to all emi<lb break="no"/>gration whatever ; and they had really nothing to render them worth <lb/>reading, but the sarcasm and caustic humour which accompanied <lb/>them. We should, therefore, have been better pleased had Mr Birk<lb break="no"/>beck allowed this restless controversist to wallow in the mire of his own <lb/>endless contradiction, and rather given us some more details regard<lb break="no"/>ing the settlement. The Americans are every year pushing forward <lb/>into the wilderness ; but it is a new thing for a body of our country<lb break="no"/>men, when withdrawing from a society richly provided with all the <lb/>accomodations which wants of civilized life render necessary <lb/>to pass through the settled and cultivated parts of the New World <lb/>and to retire to the untrodden waste a thousand miles from the sea <lb/>Though the activity of commerce carries many of the convenienes <lb/>and even luxuries of life to this remote place, still the settlers must <lb/>find such a difference in their situation as must subject them to go ma<lb break="no"/>ny privations ; and some details, shewing how the colonists got over <lb/>their difficulties, how their various wants were supplied, and how the <lb/>feelings and habits of civilized life accommodated themselves to the <lb/>woods and the wilderness, would have been much more interesting <lb/>than a reply to Cobbett's captious objections. One of the most try<lb break="no"/>ing privations of the colony seems to be a want of wives, an evil <lb/>which happily does not affect the mother country, amidst all her other <lb/>sufferings. The evil has probably been aggravated by some of the co<lb break="no"/>lonists forgetting to take their wives with them. If matters don't <lb/>get better in this particular, we may expect to hear of some of the <lb/>adjoining American towns suffering a Sabine spoliation. A cargo <lb/>of young ladies would evidently be one of the best mercantile specu<lb break="no"/>lations ; and as our own city had surplus of ten or twelve thousand <lb/>females at the last census, we have no doubt that some of our enter<lb break="no"/>prising export traders will take the hint, and, by scouring the board<lb break="no"/>ing-schools, complete a choice assortment, adapted to the Illinois <lb/>market.</p>
                <p>The following extracts the only parts that appear to have any <lb/>general interest.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="italic">English Prairie, July</hi>  13. 1819. <lb/>"My Friends and Countrymen,–For your service I exhibited, in <lb/>two publications, an outline of the process of emigration, from its <lb/>commencement up to the final settlement.</p>
                <p>"My first opinion of this, the spot of our choice, and the reasoning <lb/>on which that choice was grounded, are before you ; and sufficient <lb/>time has elapsed to try those opinnions by the test of experience, by <lb/>which they are confirmed in every important particular. I showed <lb/>you my own tract through the gloomy forest into a delightful coun<lb break="no"/>try, better prepared for an abode by the hand of nature than the heavy <lb/>woods by half a century of labour. I built me a cabin, and "belayed <lb/>a road to it;" for it was my ambition to be surrounded by my old <lb/>friends and neighbours. In this, too, I am gratified ; and we are con<lb break="no"/>tented with out allotment, both as to our present state and future <lb/>prospects.</p>
                <p>"This small district, which two years ago was nearly without inha<lb break="no"/>bitants, contains a thriving population of from six to seven hundred <lb/>persons. We have been blessed with health most unusual for a new <lb/>settlement, or for any settlement of equal numbers in any country ; <lb/>and no doubt is entertained by us, or by any judicious observer, of its <lb/>salubrity. We have several wells of excellent water, and many more <lb/>are in progress. Our soil is fertile beyond my own expectation ; but <lb/>our exertions have hitherto been chiefly directed to the permanent <lb/>objects of building and fencing, of which much has already been <lb/>done. We have, however, collected a stock of hogs and cattle ; and <lb/>I think acres of corn are now growing than there are indivi<lb break="no"/> 
               <cb/>duals in the settlement."</p>
                <p>"With regard to pecuniary success, the capitalist is commencing <lb/>his operations, or looking around him undecided as to the course he <lb/>shall pursue ; but the labourer has <hi rend="italic">made</hi>  an <hi rend="italic">establishment</hi>. It is not <lb/>with him as with the capitalist, a state of hope merely, from good <lb/>prospects, but of enjoyment, from good possessions. Numbers of <lb/>this class, and of mechanics, have already realized their little free<lb break="no"/>holds, and are building cabins for themselves. The fruits of their <lb/>labour are not squandered in dissipation and excess, because they <lb/>have highr objects ; and, considering their former depressed condi<lb break="no"/>tion, it is astonishing to me, as it is honourable to them, that they be<lb break="no"/>try no arrogance in their to independence."</p>
                <p>"In the statements I have published, I see little to correct, as far <lb/>as my observation and experience have now proceeded, excepting that, <lb/>in my view of the profits of cultivation to early settlers, I have not <lb/>made sufficient allowance in time for the innumerable delays and dis<lb break="no"/>appointments inseparable from new undertakings in a new country. <lb/>A year of preparatory and unproductive exertion should be added to <lb/>the debtor-side of the account at the outset."</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Proceedings of the Court</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Lord Provost <hi rend="smallcaps">Manderston</hi>  having been called to the Chair, the <lb/>Clerk, Mr A. Boswell, read a very distinct report of the results and <lb/>general features of the transactions at the Infirmary and Queensber<lb break="no"/>ry House Hospital for the last year. The Lord Provost then named <lb/>a Committee to examine the Treasurer's accounts, &amp;c., and report to <lb/>the adjourned meeting to be held in February next.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr John Witham</hi>  junior then rose, and requested leave to submit <lb/>a few observations to the consideration of the Court. He stated in <lb/>substance that, though aware of its not being usual to vote thanks to <lb/>the Managers until their accounts have been examined, he was yet <lb/>anxious to embrace the first opportunity of expressing his conviction <lb/>that the exertions of the Managers had, at last, placed this valuable <lb/>Institution on a most desirable footing. Although he had not visited <lb/>the Hospital for the last twelve months, he had not ceased to take an <lb/>interest in its welfare ; and it was with great pleasure that he now <lb/>stated, that whether his inquiries were made of the medical attendants, <lb/>or of <hi rend="italic">recent patients,</hi>  the answers were uniformly satisfactory. The <lb/>Hospital was favoured with a good Matron, between whom and the <cb/>medical gentlemen the best understanding existed ; and the various <lb/>salutary regulations of the Managers have led to such a prosperous <lb/>state of things, as justly to entitle them to the gratitude of this Court <lb/>and the public. Still, however, he must say, that although the Hospi<lb break="no"/>tal was in a good state, yet, in his mind, Visitors could not fall to afford <lb/>that assistance to the Managers here, and that security against internal <lb/>abuses, which they had done in so many other similar institutions. It <lb/>was difficult to account for the prejudices which existed against this spe<lb break="no"/>cies of assistance in Edinburgh. At Leeds, in addition, to visitors of <lb/>our sex, there was a committee of ladies, who visisted the female wards, <lb/>and from the joint labours of both classes of visitors many and great <lb/>advantages had resulted. But in this city we had hospitals for fe<lb break="no"/>males, which are governed by men only, without seeking any help <lb/>from visitors of that sex, who are much better qualified to discharge <lb/>most of the duties. This view of these matters, he trusted, would yet <lb/>be attended to.–He must also crave the attention of the meet<lb break="no"/>ing to another matter, that of the L.11,700, for which the city of E<lb break="no"/>dinburgh pays only 4 1/2 per cent. He assured the Court, and its Ho<lb break="no"/>noured Chairman, that this subject was not introduced with the view <lb/>of touching upon, or insinuating any thing respecting the city's af<lb break="no"/>fairs. The money, he understood, was secured on the ale duty ; but <lb/>why should the Hospital lose one-half per cent, of interest? He had <lb/>once made a calculation, according to which the loss, from the be<lb break="no"/>ginning, had amounted to about L.10,000. It had been stated that <lb/>the Magistrates of Edinburgh had always been friendly to the Hos<lb break="no"/>pital ; but that was surely no reason for withholding L.59 of interest <lb/>that whatever former Magistrates had thought on the subject the <lb/>present would not submit to the idea of depriving the Hospital of any <lb/>part of its lawful interest. If the ground on which the Hospital was <lb/>built was alluded to, it was plain that town had already got more, <lb/>by the reduced interest than its original value. The town of Edin<lb break="no"/>burgh had also got L.8273 ; 17 ; 3 of invalid money from Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, on condition of paying <hi rend="italic">the interest</hi>  to the Infirmary, <hi rend="italic">which inte- </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>, if paid at two terms in the years, should be restricted to 3 1/2 per <lb/>cent. And as the property tax–which the Town did not retain from <lb/>the Hospital, whether they did or did not pay it to Government,–is <lb/>now at an end, he could see no reason for withholding the usual rate <lb/>of interest. He concluded by suggesting the names of several gentle<lb break="no"/>men as a Committee, to lend out the sum of L.11,700 on interest at <lb/>5 per cent, if the Magistrates of Edinburgh should decline to pay that <lb/>rate of interest.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Alex. Cruishank</hi>  seconded the motion</p>
                <p>Col. <hi rend="smallcaps">Crichton</hi>  regretted that the respectable gentlemen should have <lb/>introduced such a motion. He seldom visisted the Infirmary, but <lb/>when he sent patients to it ; but he could state, that when his servants <lb/>or workmen have been there from fever, the attention they received <lb/>was in every respect equal to what he, and he hoped he was a respec<lb break="no"/>table citizen, could command in his own house. But he could men<lb break="no"/>tion the testimony of one whose authority was much higher than his <lb/>own – that of a medical gentlemen of some eminence in his profes<lb break="no"/>sion, who lives abroad, and who was recently in this country. That <lb/>professional gentleman spoke the very highest terms both of the <lb/>medical treatment and the economy of the House. It was matter <lb/>of pride, he said, to every Scotsman, to hear the manner in which the <lb/>Infirmary of Edinburgh was spoke of in all the quarters of the globe. <lb/>It was the pattern of all that was excellent in such institutions, and a <lb/>nursery of the most skilfull practitioners ; for go where we will, the <lb/>answer to almost every question put with respect to improved hospi<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>tal treatment is, that it was learned in the Infirmary of Edinburgh. <lb/>Whether, indeed, we thought of these things ; whether we looked at <lb/>the sublime inscriptions on the outside of the Hospital, and the Chris<lb break="no"/>tain doctrines and principles there inculcated or the treatement and <lb/>management within we could not fail to be struck with admiration <lb/>and without imputing any motives, which he was not entitled to do <lb/>he must say, it would be much more creditable to the respectable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen if they should confine themselves to expressing their high o<lb break="no"/>pinion of the institution and tanking the Managers instead of oc<lb break="no"/>cupying the valuable time of this Honourable Court with quibbling <lb/>about trifles, which were every way contemptible. After a pause, <lb/>Col. Crichton made a counter motion, to get rid of Mr Wigham's.</p>
                <p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Meadowbank</hi>  reminded the Court, that this matter of inte<lb break="no"/>rest had already been under the consideration of a Committee, and <lb/>decided on by the Court.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry Jardine</hi>, Esq. begged to mention a fact that the Town of <lb/>Edinburgh had contributed L.50 to the Infirmary for the last year.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Ritchie</hi>  rose and said, that though perfectly aware of what the <lb/>result would be, he could not allow the matter to be settled without <lb/>giving Mr Wigham's motion his support. It gave him much pleasure <lb/>to find it was no longer unfashionable to allude to Christian doc<lb break="no"/>trines in such meetings as this,–a change from which he anticipated <lb/>much good. He concurred in what had been said on this subject by <lb/>the gentleman at the foot of the Table ; but he begged to remind him <lb/>that it was a great principle of Christianity, that nothing was too tri<lb break="no"/>fling to be attended to it it promised good; and the additional interest of <lb/>the money in question would obviously extend the means of <hi rend="italic">healing </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">the sick</hi>, the great object of the Institution. Nothing, indeed, which <lb/>had fallen from that gentleman, or the Learned Lord on the other <lb/>side, could meet or touch the simple proposition, that <hi rend="italic">five per cent</hi>  is <lb/>the legal rate of interest, and that the Town of Edinburgh ought not <lb/>to pay less.</p>
                <p>There was another subject alluded to by Mr Wigham, on which, if <lb/>Mr W. did not, he would submit a motion, namely, <hi rend="italic">Visitori</hi>  'And <lb/>this he conceived was the fittest time for appointing them. All sides <lb/>of the house were, now agreed that the Hospital was admirably con<lb break="no"/>ducted. It was impossible, therefore, to suppose that the measure <lb/>was proposed from any distrust of the Managers. If the management <lb/>was perfect now, it was too much to expect it could continue so ; and <lb/>this was the proper time for providing against the future. In other <lb/>places the highest characters in the land had acted with visitors ; and <lb/>much benefit had been derived from them in England, and even at <lb/>Glasgow. If human nature, therefore, was not different in Edin<lb break="no"/>burgh from wht it is on the other side of the Tweed, and in the west <lb/>of Scotland, it must be admitted that Visitors would be beneficial <lb/>here also. Besides, as the Managers were aware of their strength, <lb/>and that no measure could be carried here without their consent, the <lb/>granting of Visitors would be a <hi rend="italic">boon</hi>  from themselves. He moved, <lb/>that this Court do annually name 24 or more Visitors to act month<lb break="no"/>ly by rotation, and minute such observations as shall occur to them <lb/>for the consideration of the Managers.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Wigham</hi>  seconded the motion ; but as the Court seemed averse <lb/>to entertain it, it was withdrawn.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Ritchie</hi>  then said, that as his last motion was intended chiefly <lb/>as a caveat to the Committee named by the Lord Provost, he would <lb/>also, with the same view, state the nature of a motion which he wish<lb break="no"/>ed to submit, but the merits of which he was not then fully prepared <lb/>to state. it was one, however, of which he was sure it would not be <lb/>said, that it was introduced for the purpose of giving trouble, or un<lb break="no"/>necessarily occupying the time of the Court. Its object was the pro<lb break="no"/>motion of medical science, and its nature would be understood by <lb/>his reading a single paragraph from the able Clinical Reports of Dr <lb/>Duncan junior. " Almost all hospitals (it is there stated,) publish <lb/>annual Reports; but in many cases they are intended only to fur<lb break="no"/>nish information as to the expenditure of the funds, and the names of <lb/>the office-bearers, and as a public acknowledgement of the support of <lb/>the subscribers. Such reports, however, are of no use in marking the <lb/>progress of disease, and, except for purposes mentioned above, do po<lb break="no"/>sitive harm, by causing hospital reports in general to be neglected as <lb/>utterly without value. This, however, is not the case ; and the re<lb break="no"/>ports we have of late years received from the Fever Hospitals of <lb/>Dublin and Cork are worthy of being imitated by hospitals of every <lb/>kind and in every place. Indeed, the public have a right to expect this <lb/>information in return for their liberality in supporting them. We have <cb/>only to add, that the most valuable reports often proceed entirely from <lb/>the zeal of the reporters, and are only occasional. This leads <lb/>us to suggest, that the governors of hospitals should enjoin their regu<lb break="no"/>lar as a duty upon their medical officers ; and we will <lb/>venture to say, that where it has not yet been practised, its good ef<lb break="no"/>fects upon the institution in an economical as well as professional <lb/>points of view, will soon be apparent."–His motion went to carry this <lb/>suggestion into effect ; and without farther preface he should now <lb/>read it. The substance of it was, that in addition to the Journal kept <lb/>at present, Digest of the whole should be kept in a <hi rend="italic">tabular form</hi>  but <lb/>especially of the date of admission, age, sex, and place of residence <lb/>of the patients ; date of commencement, crisis, termination and as<lb break="no"/>signed causes of their diseases ; with a diary of the temperatures and <lb/>moisture of the atmosphere, state of winds, prices of staple pro<lb break="no"/>visions &amp;c. ; with an annual medical report, taking notice of the in<lb break="no"/>crease or decrease of population, and of the employment, diet and ha<lb break="no"/>bits of the labouring classes, as far as practicable. Some of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers, he observed, seemed to be amused with this enumeration ; but <lb/>the medical gentlemen would be aware of what he pointed at. With <lb/>their peculiar and proper duties, he had no wish to interfere. They <lb/>knew them well, and discharged them faithfully and honourably. In <lb/>their practise they attended to every thing that was necessary ; but <lb/>their knowledge often died with him ; and his object was to preserve <lb/>the results of their skill and experience.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord President</hi>  said he hoped the gentlemen who had made <lb/>this motion, would see, on reflection, from the labour and time requi<lb break="no"/>site to carry it into effect, how very impracticable it would be in an <lb/>hospital like that of the Royal Infirmary, where the Managers had no <lb/>compulsory authority over the medical gentlemen, whose time was <lb/>so occupied with their own private avocations.</p>
                <p>The Proposer of the motion said, that instead answering what had <lb/>fallen from the Right Honourable Judge in his own language, he <lb/>would beg leave to read another passage from Dr Duncan's volu<lb break="no"/>ble publication, and which, he hoped, would obviate some of the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties adverted to. " The trouble (says Dr Duncan,) of keeping <lb/>such tabular records, is not so great as might be supposed. It requires <lb/>only system and regularity; and when we see how easily it is done in <lb/>the military hospital, <hi rend="italic">we cannot help regretting that it is not also in- </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">troduced general into civil hospitals.</hi>  If the practitioner himself has <lb/>not time to fill up the columns of the prescribed table, it would be <lb/>very little additional trouble to his clerk ; or if the time of that assis<lb break="no"/>tant would not easily permit him, <hi rend="italic">the duty would be very gladly taken </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">by another of the Hospital pupils.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Dr <hi rend="smallcaps">Hope</hi>, in a neat and eloquent speech, opposed the motion. The <lb/>Managers, he said, were willing to give due consideration to every <lb/>proposal from whatever quarter it might come. The present, how<lb break="no"/>ever, he considered as impractiable. To prepare tabular records of <lb/>the nature suggested, required great experience, much comprehens<lb break="no"/>ion and many talents. It was a task which every one was not qua<lb break="no"/>lified to discharge in a mnner could be beneficial to the public, <lb/>and one which gentlemen, who lived by their profession, could not be <lb/>expected to undertake. The case was different in military hospitals, <lb/>where the medical getlmen could devote the whole of their time to <lb/>their hospital duties. But it should be know, that the materials for <lb/>making up such tables are all recorded in the infirmary Journals ; and <lb/>that these Journals are open to <hi rend="italic">all the medical attendants;</hi>  so that <lb/>whoever finds that he has time and talents for the performance of <lb/>such tasks, has the fullest opportunity for undertaking and complet<lb break="no"/>ing them. Accordingly we had had the very able reports of Dr <lb/>Duncan, and the useful work of Dr Welsh. The Institution has now <lb/>the benefit of Dr Duncan's services ; and he considered it better to <lb/>leave the completion of such works and reports to the zeal and talents <lb/>of individuals.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Mover</hi>  then stated that he was perfectly aware of Dr. Welsh's <lb/>judicious publication as well as Dr Duncan's and he certainly would <lb/>never have introduced such a measure, had it not been suggested and <lb/>recommended by a much abler mind than his own. He had not un<lb break="no"/>dertaken the task from any idea that he was able to do it justice, or <lb/>that he could do it better, or even so well as many other members of <lb/>the Court ; but from the conviction, that if he had not introduced the <lb/>subject, it would be introduced at all. He had no wish, however <lb/>to give unnecessary trouble, and should, therefore, for the present, beg <lb/>leave to withdraw his motion.</p>

            </p>
                <p>Our readers will learn with pleasure, that the Lord Advocate, <lb/>with a laudable anxiety for the honour of our criminal jurispru<lb break="no"/>dence, has announced officially, that the Clerk of Court "strikes the <lb/>Jury, by taking <hi rend="italic">45</hi>  after <hi rend="italic">45, until they served in rotation.</hi> " They <lb/>consist of a " list of Jurymen furnished by the High Constables" <lb/>for Edinburgh and those "regularly required from the counties of <lb/>Linlithgow and Haddington," which names " were <hi rend="italic">then</hi>  put up<lb break="no"/>on a roll, which was put into the bands of the Clerk of Court;"– <lb/>the Jurors thus struck being cited, not by a Sheriff officer, but by <lb/>a Macer of the Justiciary ourt. We are not aware of any law <lb/>which requires the Clerk of Court to take the Jurors by rotation ; <lb/>but it reflects great credit on his judgement that he resorts to this <lb/>unequivocal mode of displaying his impartiality. This is a virtue <lb/>which the law requires in all its officers ; and it is fortunate when <lb/>such rules are devised and adhered to as make the virtue incon<lb break="no"/>trovertibly visible. At such an advanced stage of society, honour <lb/>and public opinion will secure impartial justice ; but still, when <lb/>the possibility of some retrograde movement is adverted to, it <lb/>would be a wise measure to convert what all functionaries do at <lb/>present from principle, into specific rules for directing the conduct <lb/>of their successors. The Lord Advocate, it has been reported, is <lb/>about to introduce into Parliament a Bill or Bills respecting the <lb/>Judicatories of Scotland ; and his Lordship, it is obvious, might <lb/>obtain a well-merited popularity by throwing in some clauses to <lb/>fix the qualifications of a Juror in the different counties of Scot<lb break="no"/>land, and to regulate the times and the manner in which lists of <lb/>Jurors are to be made up, reduced into a penl of 45, and then to <lb/>a jury of 15. Ther is, if we mistake not, a cerain discretion on <lb/>more than one of these points left with functionaries, who, we <lb/>doubt not, would most readily part with it. To them it would be <lb/>a relief ; and though the arraigned might sometimes have less im<lb break="no"/>partial juries than at present, yet, if the ballot were introduced <lb/>here, as it has recently been in civil cases, the impartiality would <lb/>be more coguisable, and placed beyond the reach of doubt and <lb/>misrepresentation. It would be no disgrace to Scotland to bor<lb break="no"/>row in this respect from her sister kingdom, but an honour which <lb/>France seems willing to do herself at present, and which we very <lb/>lately did ourselves in modelling our Jury Court.</p>
                <p>Mr Bywater has construced a small model of a ship in such <lb/>a manner as to exhibity, by actual experiment, the principal <lb/>magnetic phenomena mentioned by Captain Flinders, in his <lb/>voyage to New Holland. From a minute attention to the sub<lb break="no"/>ject, Mr B. has devised a plan, which, in all probability, will <lb/>remedy, by very simple means, the defect arising from the lo<lb break="no"/>cal attraction pointed out by Captain Flinders, and thus be of <lb/>real advantage to the science of navigation. A drawing of <lb/>this plan (as it will be important to ships of war) has been sent <lb/>to the Admiralty.</p>

            </p>
                <p>Salus populi suprema lex.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="enlarged-capital">T </hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">here</hi>  wasa time when it was held pure factiousness to <lb/>doubt whether the prosperity we enjoyed during the first ten <lb/>or twelve years of the late war, was perfectly sound and na<lb break="no"/>tural, and whether it would not ultimately entail upon us a <lb/>corresponding share of future calamity. But the most gloomy <lb/>anticipations of those who were most inclined to view the pic<lb break="no"/>ture on the dark side have certainly come infinitely short of <lb/>the full measure of distress and misery which have at length <lb/>fallen upon the country. It would be unjust to charge the <lb/>Government with any more of these evils than might have <lb/>been foreseen ; but now that they force themselves on the at<lb break="no"/>tention on all sides, it is perfectly fair to hold the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment accountable for all that it can remove or prevent, and <lb/>yet suffers to exist. This is the first time, we believe, in mo<lb break="no"/>dern history, when the evil of an excess, of population has come <lb/>so distinctly under the notice of a Government as to call for <lb/>a legislative remedy. The case is therefore new, and the <lb/>course to be pursued is the less obvious ; but the war was a <lb/>season of bold experiments, in which we surmounted many <lb/>difficulties once deemed insuperable : and if timidity tie up our <lb/>hands now, when humanity calls upon us to move, the world <lb/>may well say, that the boasted energy of the Government has <lb/>been entirely reserved for the supply of its own wants out of <lb/>the pockets of the people, but that, when a period of public <lb/>calamity requiress exertions of a more painful kind, it is start<lb break="no"/>led by the smallest difficulty, and will not even make such <lb/>a slight effort as might evince its sympathy with the sufferers.</p>
                <p>During the late war, the industry of the country was stimu<lb break="no"/>lated into a state of unprecedented activity, by the monopoly <lb/>we obtained of the commerce of the world–by thirty or forty <lb/>millions of the capital of the country being annually melted <lb/>down and consumed–and by the continual rise of prices pro<lb break="no"/>duced by the depreciation of the currency. The great de<lb break="no"/>mand for labour, arising out of this state of things, with the <lb/>consequent increase of wages, caused a rapid augmentation in <lb/>the numbers of the people. In the ten years ending 1811, the <lb/>rate of increase in Britain was such as would have doubled the <lb/>population in fifty-two years; and in the great manufacturing <lb/>districts it probably equalled what takes place in a new colony. <lb/>When the peace came, and was followed by the destruction of <lb/>our commercial monopoly, the cessation of the annual loans, <lb/>and the diminuition of the paper issues, the sources of our fic<lb break="no"/>titious prosperity were dried up at once : a vast reduction took <lb/>place in the demand for labour ; profits and wages fell with <lb/>prices ; while the pressure of the taxes were doubled, and one<lb break="no"/>third added to their real amount by the rise in the value of <lb/>money. The laws, however, which regulate the multiplication <lb/>of human beings, cannot instantly bend to circumstances : a <lb/>long period necessarily elapses before the population accom<lb break="no"/>modates itself to the diminished demand for labour, and dur<lb break="no"/>ing this period the labouring classes must suffe extreme mi<lb break="no"/>sery. In this state we are at present, and time, from which <lb/>we hoped relief, has only aggravated the evil. There are but <lb/>three remedies upon which any dependence can be placed <lb/>– a reduction of taxation – a change in our commercial <lb/>system – and emigration. We have little hopes as to the first, <lb/>since this would require a sacrifice on the part of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of its own interest, real or supposed, which we see no <lb/>disposition to make. A relaxation in our restrictive commer<lb break="no"/>cial system has not the same obstacles to encounter, and we <lb/>have repeated shewn that it would be highly beneficial. The <lb/>reluctance of Ministers to attempt a change that may prejudice <lb/>the interest of some particular classes, might be considered as <lb/>a prudent caution, were it not observed, that when, instead of <cb/>relieving the distress of the people, the object is to suppy the <lb/>necessities of the Treasury, none of this caution appears, but <lb/>the complaints of the sufferers are disregarded as vulgar cla<lb break="no"/>mour. But the crisis is now such, that tenderness to the in<lb break="no"/>terests of a few individuals may be cruelty to the public at <lb/>large. Though we shall preach free trade to other nations ra<lb break="no"/>ther with a bad grace, when we can no longer hold our mono<lb break="no"/>poly, it is so far well that our misfortunes are at last likely to <lb/>open our eyes to truths whch were familiar to philosophers <lb/>half a century ago. In our present circumstances, we may <lb/>perhaps almost be thankful, that a systematic error, which has <lb/>impeded our career, has kept this one resource open to us.</p>
                <p>Emigration suggests itself so naturally as a remedy for a re<lb break="no"/>dundant population, that we are rather surprised there should <lb/>be much reluctance to have recourse to it. We need not <lb/>be afraid that the practise will continue longer than the ne<lb break="no"/>cessity which produces it. " The <hi rend="italic">vis intertiae</hi>  of people in ge<lb break="no"/>neral, says <hi rend="smallcaps">Malthus</hi>, and their attachment to their homes, <lb/>are qualities so strong and general, that we may rest assured <lb/>they will not emigrate, unless, from political discontents or ex<lb break="no"/>treme poverty, they are in such a state, <hi rend="italic">as will make it as much </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">for the advantages of their country as of themselves that they </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">should go out of it.</hi> " We by no means underrate the difficul<lb break="no"/>ties that attend emigration upon a large scale, but these are <lb/>partly occasioned by the absurd practise of directing it exclu<lb break="no"/>sively to our own colonies. We have vast multitudes, whom <lb/>we can neither feed nor employ ; and surely the first and most <lb/>pressing object is to send them where they will find the means <lb/>of subsistence. There are many parts of the world besides our <lb/>own colonies open to receive them. And whether they go to <lb/>the United States, Brazil, Buenos Ayres, or to Canada, New <lb/>Holland, or the Cape of Good Hope, the advantage to this <lb/>country will be nearly the same. Among so many countries <lb/>of such extent, it would not be very difficult to dispose of half <lb/>a million of persons (young and old) within the course perhaps <lb/>of two years. But upon whatever scale emigration is conduct<lb break="no"/>ed it must be gradual; and this renders it the more important <lb/>to fix upon a plan early. Ministers have lately announced <lb/>that Canada cannot receive more emigrants at present with<lb break="no"/>out inconvenience. But had the intention of sending great <lb/>numbers to that colony been made public two years ago, corn <lb/>would have been raised for them, and men of some capital, <lb/>assured of finding abundance of labourers, would have gone <lb/>out and settled, and provided employment for those who have <lb/>not the means to establish themselves as farmers. The alarm <lb/>we feel of seeing manufactures raised up in other countries by <lb/>the skill of our expatriated artisans is very ill founded. Many <lb/>other advantges must be combined with the possession of <lb/>mechanical skill to make manufactures flourish ; and when the <lb/>former are found, able workmen will not be long wanting. Our <lb/>capital, our improved means of internal communication, our <lb/>coal fields, our laws for the protection of industry and proper<lb break="no"/>ty, the free, enlightened and active spirit of our people, with the <lb/>powers of combination resulting from the union of so many <lb/>advantages within so small a space, are better securities for <lb/>our superiority in manufactures, than attempts, which must be <lb/>nugatory, to retain a monopoly of operative skill and talent. <lb/>But the opinion which exists in foreign countries, as to the su<lb break="no"/>periority of our people in every branch of industry, will have <lb/>this good effect, that it will secure out emigrants a favourable <lb/>reception. Though the emigration, to afford any sensible re<lb break="no"/>lief to the whole country, would require to be upon an exten<lb break="no"/>sive scale, it is yet obvious, that even upon the smallest scale <lb/>it is beneficial. If six labourers are withdrawn from a small <lb/>village, or fifty from a country town, the situation of either <lb/>will be improved. The plan hitherto acted on by Government <lb/>of givingassistance to those only who could raise ten on fif<lb break="no"/>teen pounds, is chiefly objectionable, because it must restrict <lb/>the emigration within very narrow limits. If by sending away <lb/>men who are still able to subsist by their labour, others now <lb/>living on charity get employment, we are in effect relieved of <lb/>so many paupers. But the former are less disposed to leave <cb/>the country ; and with regard to those who are or must soon <lb/>become paupers, it will certainly be found more economical to <lb/>pay ten or fiften pounds each to send them abroad, than to <lb/>maintain them permanently home. It is in vain, however, <lb/>to look to private charity for the funds necessary for such an <lb/>undertaking. These must be raised by the country at large ; <lb/>and whether a tax be imposed for the special purpose, or mo<lb break="no"/>ney destined for other objects be applied to this, the country, <lb/>we have no doubt, is ready to make the sacrifice. Suppose that <lb/>even so great a sum as five millions were required, this is but <lb/>the half of what England alone pays every year for poor rates ; <lb/>and what is such a sum, if it were to afford certain relief on <lb/>an emergency lke the present? If the French and Dutch should <lb/>again disagree about the navigation of the Scheldt, or if we should <lb/>quarrel with the French or Americans about the traffic in a few <lb/>hundred wild cat-skins on the other side of the globe, how <lb/>easily would a sum ten times as large be found? Nothing <lb/>more is requisite than to take on half of the sum for two <lb/>years, which Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Vansittart</hi>  allots for paying off the nation<lb break="no"/>al debt. We not only conceive that it would be wise and <lb/>creditable to divert a part, or the whole of the actual Sinking <lb/>Fund to this purpose ; but we go so far as to think, that it is lit<lb break="no"/>tle less than disgraceful to pay off any debt at all at this crisis <lb/>with funds wrung from the earnings of a starving population. <lb/>Whatever is done, it is of vast importance to understand, that <lb/>the most pressing evil, though not absolutely permanent in its <lb/>nature, cannot be expected to subside of itself for many years. <lb/>We have not only an excess of population to dispose of, but <lb/>we have to check the principle of increase, which is rapidly <lb/>aggravating the evil. In the five years ending 1810, the po<lb break="no"/>pulation of England added one-seventieth part to its numbers <lb/>annually ; and if we suppose the ratio to have been the same <lb/>for the whole empire, each year must have had 250,000 indi<lb break="no"/>viduals more to provide for than the preceding. Till the <lb/>whole of this vast annual inrease is got rid of, the present <lb/>excess of numbers will not diminish but augment. And how <lb/>is it to be got rid of? Either the annual births must diminish <lb/>more than one-third, or famine and disease must destroy a <lb/>quarter of a million of human beings annually beyond the u<lb break="no"/>sual rate of mortality, or these two causes must operate toge<lb break="no"/>ther. Notwithstanding, therefore, the misery of the labouring <lb/>classes at this moment, we doubt whether the population is <lb/>not still on the increase, and whether still more afflicting <lb/>scenes are not awaiting us. Indeed, unless measures are taken <lb/>to do away the factitious stimulus which the English poor<lb break="no"/>laws give to the increase of population, the most abundant e<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>migration will prove but a feeble palliative. These are rather <lb/>discouraging circumstances ; but the evil must be dealt with in <lb/>some way, or it will ultimately overwhelm us. It has now be<lb break="no"/>come rather a question of humanitiy than of policy. One or <lb/>two millions of human beings have been suddenly deprived of <lb/>their means of subsistence by events over which they had no <lb/>control. With such a mass of individuals goaded to despera<lb break="no"/>tion by want–a deficient crop,–a sudden revulsion in trade– <lb/>a more general exclusion of our manufactures by the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans,–any of those numerous casualties, in short to which e<lb break="no"/>very nation is exposed, would place us in a situation frightful <lb/>to contemplate. Plots and insurrections will keep up a con<lb break="no"/>tinual alarm. Neither persons nor property will be safe, and <lb/>capital will gradually leave the country. If theory were silent, <lb/>experience must now convince us, that time alone will produce <lb/>no material amelioration in our circumstances ; and the relief <lb/>which is may ultimately bring, will be obtained only through <lb/>the destruction of vast multitudes by famine and disease. In <lb/>the fifth year of peace, it is now time to look the evil in the <lb/>face, and either to make some great sacrifices for its removal, <lb/>or to brace our minds to bear the dreadful alternative. It is <lb/>in vain to disguise the matter to our own consciences. Those <lb/>who propose to leave things to what they call the course of <lb/>nature, are in substance recommending that thousands of their <lb/>fellow-creatures should be suffered to rot away from the effect <lb/>of absolute want. That such a thing should take place in the</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">The Fifth Report</hi>  of the Committee of the Society for the <lb/>Improvement of Prison Discipline, &amp;c.–1823. With an Ap<lb break="no"/>pendix, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="enlarged-capital">T </hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">his Report</hi>  only reached us yesterday ; but the So<lb break="no"/>ciety brings so much benevolence into activity, under the <lb/>guidance of practical wisdom, aided by very enlightened <lb/>views of the best interests of society, that we consider any <lb/>delay improper in calling the attention of the public to <lb/>their valuable proceedings. The present Report abounds <lb/>with evidence that they have not relaxed in their exer<lb break="no"/>tions. At home, not only are the laws improving, but the <lb/>magistracy are carrying improvements into all the practical <lb/>departments. A great many jails, designed on much bet<lb break="no"/>ter principlpes, are in progress in different parts of the <lb/>country ; and in those which are used, it may be said, <hi rend="italic">ge<lb break="no"/>nerally</hi>, that much more attentions is paid to health, clean<lb break="no"/>liness, diet, employment, and classification. It must not <lb/>be thought, however, that nothing remains to be done. <lb/>There are still jails in which prisoners are double ironed, <lb/>and chained to the floor of their cels from night to morn<lb break="no"/>ing ; others in which persons committed <hi rend="italic">for trial</hi>  are fet<lb break="no"/>tered with irons of the weight of from seven to nine pounds ; <lb/>and others in which debtors are exposed to the contami<lb break="no"/>nating society of criminals, in which neither the various <lb/>classes of prisoners, nor the two sexes, are kept separate <lb/>from each other, and in which all are allowed to be idle. <lb/>The Magistrates of Surrey have provided a <hi rend="italic">covered</hi>  vehicle <lb/>for conveying prisoners to the Sessions'house ; but in the <lb/>metropolis, it would appear, the practise still continues of <lb/>inflicting public degradation on parties arraigned or merely <lb/>suspected of crime, by marching them <hi rend="italic">handcuffed</hi>  through the <lb/>streets of London ; and, very recently, a party of <hi rend="italic">one hun- </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">dred prisoners</hi>  were marched for a mile <hi rend="italic">handcuffed </hi>
               <lb/>through the open streets, <hi rend="italic">in order to be formally set at liber- </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">ty by proclamation !</hi>  So much for metropolitan decorum ! <lb/>These shameful exhibitions and practises cannot, however, <lb/>long maintain their ground ; the publicity given to them, <lb/>through the proceedings of the Society should, of itself, be <lb/>enough to do them away ; but while they are continued <lb/>England should be somewhat chary of her boasts. The <lb/>views and principles of the Prison Society are attracting <lb/>notice and gaining ground in France, Switzerland, the Ne<lb break="no"/>therlands, Hanover, Bavaria, Wurtemberg, Denmark, Nor<lb break="no"/>way, Sweden, and Russia. At Christiana the Magistrates <lb/>have already resolved on the erection of a new city gaol. In <lb/>St Petersburgh the prisoners are now furnished with food, <lb/>clothing, baths, and medical assistance. A Ladies' Asso<lb break="no"/>ciation, under the patronage of the Princess <hi rend="smallcaps">Mesthersky</hi>, <lb/>is also in full activity at St Petersburgh ; and there is an <lb/>auxiliary prison society at Orel, on the very frontiers of Sibe<lb break="no"/>ria. Seven thousand prisoners passed through Orel last year ; <lb/>but their chains have been lightened, and their condition <lb/>meliorated generally, through the exertions of the Russian <lb/>Society. For details, however, we must refer to the Re<lb break="no"/>port itself ; but we cannot take leave of it without making <lb/>special notice of the benefits conferred on society by <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Female Associations</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Temporary Refuge</hi>. The <lb/>almost miraculous power of kindness, when accompanied, <lb/>as genuine kindness often is, with quiet feeling and unob<lb break="no"/>trusive goodness, continues to be exemplified in the Ladies' <lb/>Committee, of which Mrs <hi rend="smallcaps">Fry</hi>, we believe, is still at the head. <lb/>In Newgate, idleness, dissipation, and licentiousness, have <lb/>been succeeded by industry, order, and restraint ; and the <lb/>same committee accomplish much good by visiting the ships <lb/>in which convicts are embarked for New South Wales. <lb/>Arrangements are thus made for the formation of schools <lb/>for moral and religious instruction during the voyage, and <lb/>the convicts are furnished not only with suitable clothing <lb/>and other necessaries, but the means of employment in the <lb/>manufacture of such articles as may be readily sold for their <lb/>relief on arriving at the colony. These are truly good <lb/>works ; and too much praise cannot be bestowed on the <lb/>Ladies by whom they are performed. It is gratifying to <cb/>observe that Female Associations for visiting prisons have <lb/>been established in Bedford, Bristol, Carlisle, Colchester, <lb/>Derby, Dumfries, Durham, Exeter, Lancaster, Notting<lb break="no"/>ham, Plymouth, York, and <hi rend="italic">Glasgow</hi>. We had once thought <lb/>that, by this time, we might have added <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi>  ; and <lb/>we are inclined to hope that the present Lord Pro<lb break="no"/>vost will yet employ his influence in establishing a La<lb break="no"/>dy's Society for the prisons of our Metropolis.– <lb/>There, too, we had cherished, and still cherish, the hope, <lb/>of seeing a House of Refuge. The temporary refuge of <lb/>the Prison Society is chiefly for affording relief to distress<lb break="no"/>ed boys, who, on their discharge from the prisons of the <lb/>metropolis, have expressed a desire to abandon their crimi<lb break="no"/>nal courses. Many of these are in circumstances of urgent <lb/>want ; and " the Committee can now look round wtih plea<lb break="no"/>sure on many who are variously settled, and <hi rend="italic">conducting them- </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">selves</hi>  exemplarily. In the temporary refuge they are <lb/>trained up to habits of industry, instructed in moral and <lb/>religious duty, and after a time are provided with suitable <lb/>situations." There is a great similarity in the histories of <lb/>the individuals admitted into this asylum ; but the greater <lb/>number, obviously, consists of boys, who had been almost <lb/>driven to commit petty thefts from want of employment or <lb/>destitution, or who, from neglect or loss of parents, had <lb/>fallen into the company of professed thieves. The Commit<lb break="no"/>tee mention that on one recent occasion, no less than <hi rend="italic">eight </hi>
               <lb/>boys were released from Newgate in one day, and imme<lb break="no"/>diately after they had undergone the sentence of <hi rend="italic">flogging, </hi>
               <lb/>which, upon some insane rule, is usually carried into ef<lb break="no"/>fect on the day of their discharge. Their persons are thus <lb/>marked with the stigma of guilt, and, from soreness and <lb/>want of strength, they are disabled from working, at the <lb/>very time they ought to go in search of employment. No <lb/>more effectual plan could have been devised to irritate these <lb/>boys against society, to prevent them from obtaining employ<lb break="no"/>ment, though desirous of it, or to impel them to recommence <lb/>their career of crime. We entreat those who are inclined to <lb/>look upon what they call a <hi rend="italic">smart whipping</hi>  as the only corrective <lb/>for juvenile offences, to reflect a little on the consequences <lb/>to which their system inevitably tends. <hi rend="italic">We</hi>  are decidedly, <lb/>and in all cases, against the deliberate infliction of pain, <lb/>merely to be felt as such. In the case of children, if not <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi>  for that purpose, it will certainly give them the <lb/>idea of power superior to their own, and may thus be the <lb/>means of constraining more readily than otherwise ; but <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">the law</hi>, when it inflicts pain, has always other means of <lb/>evincing its power, and constraining those who are within <lb/>its grasp. Its most important function is to <hi rend="italic">prevent crime ; </hi>
               <lb/>its next is o convince those who comit offences that the <lb/>means of detection are, on the whole, so sure that no<lb break="no"/>thing is to be gained by the commission ; and its next, to <lb/>make restitution onerous and complete. There may also <lb/>be some classes of criminals who ought to be considered <lb/>and treated as <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> –some are curable ; and some as incur<lb break="no"/>ably furious, who must either be cut off altogether, or <lb/>confined for life. We are not opposed to the infliction <lb/>of punishments, because in our opinion the most effec<lb break="no"/>tual of those will be found to consist in the best means <lb/>of preventing or remedying the evils produced by crime. <lb/>All exposures, restraints, constraints, and compulsory re<lb break="no"/>parations are punishments. We are only hostile to the inflic<lb break="no"/>tion of pain for no other purpose but because pain is produced. <lb/>If it can be made <hi rend="italic">obvious</hi>  to the sufferers that the pain inflicted <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">protects others</hi>, or affords <hi rend="italic">true reparation</hi>  for the wrongs <lb/>done to them or society, we shall then grant that such pu<lb break="no"/>nishments may be both just and expedient. The Prison <lb/>Society, while they vindicate themselves, temperately but <lb/>firmly, from the charge of having yielded to a sort of blind <lb/>and irrational benevolence, and advocated measures which <lb/>went to raise the condition of prisoners above that of com<lb break="no"/>mon labourers, do still seem to us to have been too much <lb/>moved by the coarse jokes and reckless speculations of a <lb/>clever essayist. If they err at all, they seem now to be <lb/>somewhat too indulgent to the advocates of hard labour <lb/>and severe punishments. We are rather inclined to think <lb/>them too decidely in favour of the tread mill, which they <lb/>allow has been so worked or constructed at different places <cb/>as to form very unequal measures of punishment, and they <lb/>very properly insist that every tread-mill should be pro<lb break="no"/>vided with " a regulator," by which its rate of revolution <lb/>may at all times be restrained within safe limits, and a <lb/>dial-register, (lately invented by Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Bate</hi>, instrument<lb break="no"/>maker to the Board of Excise) by which the rate of labour <lb/>may be, at any time, accurately ascertained, and which <lb/>( they think ) should in no case exceed 12,000 feet in ascent <lb/>for one day. There is an able argument in the report against <lb/>compelling persons to labour who are merely imrpisoned <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">for trial</hi>  : and there is a great mass of curious and useful <lb/>information in the Appendix.</p>

                <p>In January, 1823, there were 3,031 in the hulks ; 2,138 have <lb/>been received since ; 1,402 have been sent to New South Wales ; <lb/>and 300 to <hi rend="italic">Bermuda</hi>  ; 468 have been discharge by pardon or <lb/>transferred to other establishments ; 3 have escaped ; 43 have died ; <lb/>and 2,953 remained in the different hulks on 1st Janury last. <lb/>The health of these prisoners has been good, their conduct or<lb break="no"/>derly.</p>
                <p>The Office-bearers of the <hi rend="italic">Refuge for the Destitute</hi>  have, during <lb/>the last year, given relief to 424 persons. They have apprenticed <lb/>to trades, recommended to service or employment, or restored to pa<lb break="no"/>rents and friends, 214 individuals :–under their charge at present <lb/>154. Most of the male culprits require to be kept two years at <lb/>least. The expenditure has been very considerable. Mr Peel has <lb/>recommended a grant from Parliament.</p>
                <p>As we feared, the bill introduced for the purpose of qualifying <lb/>persons possessed of personal property to serve as juries contains <lb/>no regulations for the more impartial striking of juries, or returning <lb/>or making up of those who are to serve on each jury. There does <lb/>seem to be an improvement on the <hi rend="italic">form</hi>  of the returns to be made <lb/>by the Constables to the Sheriffs.</p>

                <p>Repeated instances have lately occurred, in whcih dwelling<lb break="no"/>houses have suffered damage by fire, owing to the carelessnes of <lb/>servants and others, who, by way of economy, take off fires at <lb/>night and put the burning coals under the grate, not recollecting <lb/>that, in the construction of almost every house, the stone placed <lb/>under the grate is supported by timber, separated from the hearth <lb/>stone by some lime only. The wood underneath being once ig<lb break="no"/>nited, the fire will rapidly spread, and may in a few hours involve <lb/>the whole tenement in flames.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to Australia.</hi> –We understand that the esta<lb break="no"/>blishment of an Australian Company has suggested to a num<lb break="no"/>ber of public spirited individuals the idea of forming a society to <lb/>aid deserving persons in their endeavours to emigrate and settle in <lb/>New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, and that matters are <lb/>actually in progress for carrying this benevolent project into effect. <lb/>On Wednesday a meeting was held in the Freemasons' Hall, Niddry <lb/>Street, which was respectably attended, the Rev. Mr Lothian in <lb/>the Chair, when a series of resolutions were moved by William <lb/>Ellis, Esq. S. S. C., and seocnd by Robert Paul, Esq. of the <lb/>Commercial Bank. The principal object comprehended in those <lb/>were the security of the persons and property of emigrants on the <lb/>voyage–the maintenance of a regular communication with friends <lb/>left behind, and the insuring a friendly welcome, temporary ac<lb break="no"/>commodation, and facilities for permanent settlement in the country <lb/>of their adoption. It was also proposed to give assistance in <lb/>money to deserving emigrants, for the purpose of defraying the <lb/>expenses of freight and passage out–every applicant being first <lb/>well recommended, and his character subjected to strict scrutiny. <lb/>Masons, wrights, smiths, and other artisans, schoolmasters, farm<lb break="no"/> servants, and labourers, are the classes to which the principles of <lb/>the society specially apply.</p>
                <p>According to the opinion of persons largely engaged in the silk<lb break="no"/>trade, the amount of drawback to be allowed on silk that has paid <lb/>the duty will be between t300,000 and t400,000.</p>
                <p>On Sunday evening a disturbance took place in a house in <lb/>Tobago Street, and the Police were called, who, to make sure of <lb/>the rioter, secured the door ; at which a young woman, a servant, <lb/>became so much alarmed, that she leaped out of a window, situat<lb break="no"/>ed on the third floor, whereby her back was broken. She now lies <lb/>very ill in the Royal Infirmary.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">The Army</hi> –The several Recruiting Parties throughout <lb/>Great Britain and Ireland having received their instructions, are <lb/>now actively employed in raising men for the three new Regi<lb break="no"/>ments of the Line, whose establishments, it is expected, will be <lb/>in a very short time completed. The Head-quarters of the 97th <lb/>Regiment are changedfrom Gosport to Winchester.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Secretary Peel</hi>, in moving the commitment of the Trans<lb break="no"/>portation Bill, stated, that the objects of the bill were, first, to <lb/>continue the laws on transportation, that would expire before the <lb/>next session ; and next, to cimplify the law. In the last session <lb/>a bill had been passed to enable the Crown to make an experiment <lb/>of the union of the hulk and transportation system, by sending <lb/>convicts to Bermuda. There had been as yet hardly time to de<lb break="no"/>cide fully on the experiment, but, as far as it could be judged of, it <lb/>was satisfactory. It had been hithero complained that transporta<lb break="no"/>tion was a very esqual punishment, and certainly there was a great <lb/>different in the effect of the punishment upon a man of settled ha<lb break="no"/>bits, and with a family, and upon a man of no fixed habits, to whom, <lb/>as hitherto managed, it had scarcely been a punishment. He wish<lb break="no"/>ed it to be known, that arrangements had been made in New South <lb/>Wales, to send some of the convicts to a distant part of the set<lb break="no"/>tlement, where the punishment would be more severe. A selection <lb/>would be made from the convicts, so as to make the punishment <lb/>efficient against those to whom it had hitherto had no terror.– <lb/>He gave this statement because it was right the public should <lb/>know that transportation would be henceforward a real punishment.</p>

                <p>Mr Greig, after stating the correspondence which took place be<lb break="no"/>tween him and the Fiscal, which led to the suppression of his jour<lb break="no"/>nal, gives the following account of his interview with that func<lb break="no"/>tionary. "On Monday evening, the Fiscal sent a messenger to <lb/>me, requesting I would call at his house, in Strand-street; I did <lb/>so ; he then opened a conversation upon the subject of my paper, <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">The South African Commercial Advertiser</hi>, and said he was in<lb break="no"/>structed to inform me that I had departed from the Prospectus – <lb/>that it was become obnoxious to the Government, and referred <lb/>more particularly to the last three or four Numbers. I asked him <lb/>to point out such parts as were immediately objectionable. He then <lb/>mentioned some <hi rend="italic">leading remarks</hi>, which (he said) bore upon the <lb/>Administration of the Colony. He further pointed out as " <hi rend="italic">ob- </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">noxious,</hi> " all quotations which had been made from " De Lolne[?], <lb/>"Blackstone," and " Civil Servant's"work " Lacon," and, ge<lb break="no"/>nerally all extracts relative to the Liberty of the Press, observing <lb/>–" Nobody can doubt the obvious tendency of these ; and, as we <lb/>are not men in this Colony, but merely infants," it was, in his opi<lb break="no"/>nion, dangerous to insert such matter. He added, also, that it was <lb/>expected I should, in future, publish no parts of trials, but wait <lb/>until the whole were finished ; and, even then, all scurrilous parts <lb/>(such as the Memorial of Mr L. Cooke to the Treasury), were to <lb/>be omitted. That I was further to bound down with two sure<lb break="no"/>ties, in the penalty of ten thousand rix-dollars, that nothing of the <lb/>offensive nature pointed out, should appear in any future number ; <lb/>and, lastly, that I was to take particular care, that the next num<lb break="no"/>ber (18) contained no matter of the description alluded to, nor any <lb/>notice of Mr Edward's trial. To all this, I replied, that I would <lb/>give no promise as to what would appear in the next or any future <lb/>number. That I required time to consider what was fitting to be <lb/>done with regard to the security demanded."</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The Morning Chronicle</hi>  makes the following remarks on this <lb/>case :– We cannot say that we are surprised that acts of this de<lb break="no"/>scription should take place in our Colonies. Uncontrouled power <lb/>produces every day in Europe the worst effects on men of the best <lb/>dispositions, and the best talents, and the Governors of our con<lb break="no"/>quered Colonies, and New South Wales, are unfortunately <lb/>quite absolute. In Europe the people under absolute Governments <lb/>have this advantage over the people in our colonies, that men in <lb/>office are generally selected with some reference to abilities and ac<lb break="no"/>quirements. But with the exception of the East Indies, the Go<lb break="no"/>nernment of which, with all its faults, generally, we believe, avails <lb/>itself of talents, our colonies are unfortunately considered as mere <lb/>places of refuge for the relatives of our Aristocracy, of whom nothing <lb/>can be made in this country. This is what constitutes fitness for a <lb/>Colonial Office ; and so far from being astonished at the disgrace<lb break="no"/>ful scenes which are constantly taking place in the colonies, every <lb/>person capable of reflecting at all upon the matter would be asto<lb break="no"/>nished were he to find common abilities the holder of a colonial <lb/>appointment of any value. Of Lord Charles Somerset, the less that <lb/>is said the better. In fact nothing is more wanted than the perusal <lb/>of a Cape of Good Hope Almanack, to satisfy the British public <lb/>what sort of personage he is. Would it be believe, that in a <lb/>country of boundless extent, with only a settlement here and there, <lb/>where the greatest enemies the Colonists have to contend with, are <lb/>the wild animals, it could possible enter in to the head of any ra<lb break="no"/>rional being to introduce laws for the preservation of game. One <lb/>would as soon expect to hear laws in Turkey for the preservation <lb/>of the plague. Yet it so happens, that a code which would do <lb/>credit to Sir John Shelley himself, guarding against the possible <lb/>disinction of the game of Africa, occupies a goodly space in the <lb/>Cape Almanack. After such a specimen of wisdom, all criticism on <lb/>this personage would be thrown away.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">House of Commons.–June 19.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>The Speaker took the Chair at a few minutes before <lb/>four o'clock, and was shortly afterwards summoned by <lb/>the Deputy Usher of the Black Rod, to attend the <lb/>House of Lords.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Speaker</hi>  stated, on his return, that the Royal <lb/>Assent had been given by Commission to several public <lb/>and private bills.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">C. Dundas</hi>  presented a petition from Newbury, <lb/>in the county of Berks, praying for the abolition of sla<lb break="no"/>very in the West Indies.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Planta</hi>  moved for a new writ for the election of <lb/>a member to serve in Parliament, in the room of Lord <lb/>Leveson Gower, who had accepted the office of Chief<lb break="no"/>Secretary for Ireland.–Ordered.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Ale-House Licensing Bill.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>On the motion of Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Estcourt</hi>, the house resolved <lb/>itself into a committee on this bill.</p>
                <p>On the clause that no brewer who should himself sup<lb break="no"/>ply public houses with beer, should be allowed to act or <lb/>assist as a Magistrate at any meeting or session for the <lb/>granting of licenses,</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Bernal</hi>  moved that this clause be struck out <lb/>altogether.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">R. Gordon</hi>  supported the clause.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Monck</hi>  thought this the most valuable clause <lb/>in the bill, and that it was no infringemnt, but a sa<lb break="no"/>lutary interference with the jurisdiction of borough <lb/>magistrates.</p>
                <p>Strangers were ordered to withdraw, and the com<lb break="no"/>mittee divided, when there were–Ayes 46–Noes 53– <lb/>Majority against the clause 7.</p>
                <p>Several amendments, verbal and otherwise, were then <lb/>agreed to, amongst which was the omission of the <lb/>words " Cinque Ports," thus excluding that class of <lb/>places from the operation of the bill. <cb/>On the clause being proposed relative to the hours <lb/>during which public houses should be kept open on <lb/>Sundays.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Estcourt</hi>  said, the original clause was to the <lb/>effect that public-houses should be closed during the <lb/>hours of morning and afternoon's divine service, but he <lb/>thought it would be better not to permit publicans to <lb/>allow drinking or tippling on their premises till after <lb/>the usual hour of the conclusion of morning service <lb/>(one o'clock.)</p>
                <p>After a conversation, in which several hon. members <lb/>participated, the clause was agreed to.</p>
                <p>Several other clauses having been then read and agreed <lb/>to, the house resumed ; the report was brought up, or<lb break="no"/>dered to be taken into further consideration on Monday <lb/>next, and printed.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">The Usury Laws.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">P. Thompson</hi>  moved the second reading of the <lb/>usury laws amendment bill.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Davenport</hi>  said he should oppose the bill, as <lb/>he considered it to be highly injurious both to the land<lb break="no"/>ed and commercial interests. The hon. members moved <lb/>an amendment, that the bill be read a second time that <lb/>day three months.</p>
                <p>The question on th amendment having been put,</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Chancellor</hi>  of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Exchequer</hi>  suggested <lb/>the propriety of postponing this bill until the next ses<lb break="no"/>sion of parliament. He made this suggestion from no <lb/>unfriendly feeling towards the bill, but merely because <lb/>this was not, he conceived, the most convenient time to <lb/>consider it. The subject ought to be fully considered, <lb/>with a view to get rid of evils that existed, without in<lb break="no"/>terfering with long-continued prejudices. If the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion were postponed he would give the subject the <lb/>best attention in his, ( <hi rend="italic">hear</hi>.)</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Heathcote</hi>  approved of the suggestion of the <lb/>right hon. gentleman, and wished the discussion on the <lb/>question to be postponed till the next session of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps"> L. Foster</hi>  thought that, between the total repeal, <lb/>or the continued existence of the Usury Laws, in their <lb/>present shape, a middle course might be steered. Of <lb/>the bill before the house he thought that, under the <lb/>guise of a simple enactment, it covered one of the great<lb break="no"/>est illusion ever held forth to Parliament or the coun<lb break="no"/>try, for he was convinced that it would effect as com<lb break="no"/>plete and as practicable a repeal of the usury laws as <lb/>could be proposed. It became necessary, therefore, to <lb/>consider the probable operation of that repeal upon all <lb/>the great interest of the country. The bill might give <lb/>relief to few, but would bring injury to many.</p>
                <p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston</hi>  thought the house indebted to <lb/>the hon. member for Dover for bringing in the bill. It <lb/>might be possible to form a bill better than that of the <lb/>hon. member, but his bill was better than the present <lb/>law, and as such he should vote for it.</p>
                <p>The gallery was then cleared, and the house divided, <lb/>when there appeared for the second reading,–Ayes, 52; <lb/>Noes, 40 : majority in favour of the second reading, 12.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Voters' Registration Bill.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Nugent</hi>  moved the second reading of the <lb/>voters' registration bill, and said that his object in car<lb break="no"/>rying it through the present stage was, that the bill <lb/>might be committed <hi rend="italic">pro forma,</hi>  for the purpose of hav<lb break="no"/>ing certain amendment introduced into it. It would <lb/>then be printed with its amendments, in order that the <lb/>house and the country might have the opportunity of <lb/>considering its details between this and the next session <lb/>of Parliament.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">R. Wilson</hi>  moved, as an amendment, that the <lb/>bill might be read a second time that day six months.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">H. Gurney</hi>  seconded the amendment.</p>
                <p>The question was then put on the amendment, which <lb/>was agreed to, and the bill was ordered to be read a se<lb break="no"/>cond time this day six months.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Salmon Fisheries Preservation Bill.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>On the motion of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chancellor</hi>  of <hi rend="smallcaps">Exche- </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">quer</hi>, the house resolved itself into a committee on the <lb/>salmon fisheries preservation bill.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Ferguson</hi>  proposed the insertion of a clause, <lb/>exempting from the operation of the bill the salmon <lb/>fisheries in the River and Bay of Thurso, in the county <lb/>of Caithness, which are the exclusive property of Sir <lb/>John Sinclair.</p>
                <p>After some conversation the gallery was cleared, and <lb/>the committee divided, when the clause was lost.</p>
                <p>The bill having passed through the committee, the <lb/>report was ordered to be received this day.</p>
                <p>The other orders were then disposed of, and the house <lb/>adjourned at half-past two o'clock.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Friday, </hi>

                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">G. Murray</hi>  took the oaths and his seat, on his <lb/>re-election for the county of Perth.</p>
                <p>A number of petitions were presented against the <lb/>continuance of Negreo Slavery.</p>

                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">G. Hill</hi>  presented a petition from the Chamber <lb/>of Commerce of the city of Londonderry, praying that <lb/>the bill for amending the laws relating to Banks in Ire<lb break="no"/>land might not be allowed to make further progress for <lb/>the present. The petition was laid on the table.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">A. Chichester</hi>  presented a petition from Bel<lb break="no"/>fast, praying a reduction of the duty on coals in Ire<lb break="no"/>land, which was laid upon the table.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Scotch Gaols' Bill.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord Advocate</hi>, in moving that this bill be <lb/>read a second time and printed, observed, that it was <lb/>not his intention to press it further during the present <lb/>Session. No man could, however, deny that the <lb/>object of the Bill was of great importance, and he <lb/>proposed, therefore, to have its provisions made <lb/>generally known throughout the country, in order that <lb/>it might be again presented to the house in as perfect a <lb/>shape as possible.</p>
                <p>The bill was then read a second time, and ordered to <lb/>be printed.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Committee of Supply.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>In the committee of supply, a number of grants of mi<lb break="no"/>nor importance were agreed to.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">H. Hardinge</hi>  said, he had another resolution to <lb/>propose, but it was in which he expected that a re<lb break="no"/>duction would be made next year. It was, that a sum <lb/>of L283,199, 8s 1d be granted for the expenses of the <lb/>disembodied[?] militia of the united kingdom.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Spring Rice</hi>  said, that within the last twelve <lb/>years there had been two millions and a half expended <lb/>on this body, and that the subject was one which few <lb/>gentlemen took the trouble to look at. He begged to say <lb/>a word upon the Irish militia. There the whole of the <lb/>staff, which was larger than that of England, was with<lb break="no"/>out a private man. Nothing could a more outra<lb break="no"/>geous job than that of the milita in Ireland. The co<lb break="no"/>lonels kept the whole patronage of the regiment, and <lb/>kept up the bands for the amusemen of themselves and <lb/>friends. The militia might have been of service at one <lb/>time in Ireland ; but since that time the present effec<lb break="no"/>tive police had been established, and quite superseded <lb/>it. He trusted Ministers would not suffer this to remain <lb/>if they really wished to be economical, and curtail, if <lb/>not abolish it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Chancellor</hi>  of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Exchequer</hi>  begged to <lb/>assure his hon. friend that he wanted no prompting to <lb/>make any economical reduction. When, however, a <lb/>plan for the reduction of the staff was ready, and it was <lb/>in contemplation, it would be laid before Parliament, <lb/>and he should then be the friend of the definite and li<lb break="no"/>mited powers to which he had alluded.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Hume</hi>  said, the militia had been defended as <lb/>though the country were in hourly danger of invasion <cb/>–as if the country could be taken by surprise. If that <lb/>were so, he would gladly learn of what use were the <lb/>spies, who cost us L450,000 a-year. We had ambas<lb break="no"/>sadors–they were very little better than spies–at an <lb/>expense of L450,00a-year ; and if their cautious ob<lb break="no"/>servance were not sufficient to save the country from <lb/>sudden invasion, he knew no better means, and he cer<lb break="no"/>tainly knew no other advantage which ambassadors and <lb/>consuls could be of.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">New South Wales Bill–Committee.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>On the order of the day having been read for the <lb/>house resolving itself into committee on the New South <lb/>Wales bill.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Huskisson</hi>  moved that the Speaker do leave <lb/>the chair.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">J. Mackintosh</hi>  said, the object of his present <lb/>motion, of which he had previously given notice, was, <lb/>to propose two instruction to the committee on the bill <lb/>which the right hon. gentleman (Mr Huskisson) had <lb/>introduced–first, to the effect that the committee should <lb/>recommend the introduction of a clause for the esta<lb break="no"/>blishment of a trial by jury in New South Wales and <lb/>Van Diemen's Land; and secondly, that it should re<lb break="no"/>commend that a clause be introduced, providing for the <lb/>election of one-third of the Legislative Council from <lb/>among persons enjoying an income of L100 a year, and <lb/>having been free inhabitants of the colonies for the space[?] <lb/>of three years. The best local authories in fa<lb break="no"/>vour of his proposition. Among these he might men<lb break="no"/>tion the names of Governor Hunter, Governor Bligh, <lb/>Mr Bent, the Judge Advocate, Governor Macquarrie, <lb/>and his successor Sir Thomas Brisbane, who had gone <lb/>out to the colony prejudiced against the introduction in<lb break="no"/>to it of these institutions ; but, after two years careful <lb/>investigation of the subject, wrote home in Oct. 1825, <lb/>stating, that there was now no longer any doubt <lb/>about its perfect ripeness for them.–( <hi rend="italic">Hear, hear.)– </hi>
               <lb/>The partial introduction of English institutions into <lb/>immediate practise was the only pledge of a real inten<lb break="no"/>tion on the part of government to introduce them more <lb/>completely in the end. The right hon. gent. concluded <lb/>by moving that instruction be given to the committee <lb/>to recommend the introduction of Trial by Jury into the <lb/>colony, and to allow the inhabitants a voice in the le<lb break="no"/>gislative councils.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Huskisson</hi>  said, in the bill which he had intro<lb break="no"/>duced, it was intended to extend the privilege to the <lb/>government of the country of granting trial by jury <lb/>in all civil cases. His right hon. friend would find, if <lb/>he examined, that the foundation would be laid of grant<lb break="no"/>ing the inhabitants of that colony a share in managing <lb/>their own concerns. At present the legislature propos<lb break="no"/>ed, by way of a first step, to appoint a legislative com<lb break="no"/>mittee for the purpose of watching and controuling <lb/>every measure of the state. All trials should be public, <lb/>under the inspection of a free press, and a population <lb/>jealous of their rights. They should now be prepared <lb/>in the course of a few years for the regular introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of a legislative assembly ; not had he any fears <lb/>when such a change should take place, that it would <lb/>lead to any political convulsion.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Hume</hi>  had every reason to believe, that if, in<lb break="no"/>stead of inflicting a military governemtn, they would <lb/>introduce a portion of representation and the privileges <lb/>of British subjects into New South Wales, it would be <lb/>the most flourishing of the colonies.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Horace Twiss</hi>  said, the knowledge of one fact <lb/>might obviate the necessity for one at least of the <lb/>right hon. gent.'s propsitions, namely, that the gover<lb break="no"/>nor of the colony had the power of extending to the co<lb break="no"/>lonists the right of trial by jury if he should deem it ex<lb break="no"/>pedient.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">James Mackintosh</hi>  here intimated that he <lb/>should not press his amendments. They were accord<lb break="no"/>ingly negatived.</p>
                <p>The house then resolved itself into the Committee <lb/>when several verbal amendments were proposed and <lb/>agreed to.</p>
                <p>The bill then went through the committee, and the <lb/>report, with the amendments, was ordered to be brought <lb/>up on Monday.</p>
                <p>The other orders of the day were then disposed of, <lb/>and the house adjourned at half-past two o'clock.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Bervic.</hi> –There has been raised this season on the <lb/>high lands of the farm of Hallgreen, belonging to Mr <lb/>Blair, a few acres of <hi rend="italic">Rib-grass</hi>, a native plant of New <lb/>South Wales. It was imported to this country two <lb/>years ago by a man who had served his time in Van <lb/>Dieman's Land. Its[?] favourite soil seems to be high <lb/>land or muir country, and is so rapid in growth, that it <lb/>appears not only to choke but to extirpate[?] every weed <lb/>with which it comes in contact. It is said to be the <lb/>best plant in the world both for feeding cattle, and for <lb/>producing mik from cows, of the best and richest qua<lb break="no"/>lity. Were the propiertors and tenants of the Highland <lb/>country to follow the enterprising conduct of Mr Blair, <lb/>we would soon see their hills covering with a truly useful <lb/>plant, instead of the useless heath, with at present, even <lb/>at best, only adorns them.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">House of Commons.</hi> – <hi rend="smallcaps">June 4</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Sir J. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mackintosh</hi>  presented a petition from Mr <lb/>Charles Buck, complaining that managers of theatres <lb/>were allowed to perform dramatic pieces without the <lb/>knowledge or leave of the writer, and without any pro<lb break="no"/>fit to him. The hon. member said that Lord Byron <lb/>and Mr Millman had made similar complaints, and that <lb/>every person who had given that subject consideration <lb/>admitted that literary property was not sufficiently pro<lb break="no"/>tected in this country, and that the decline of dramatic <lb/>writing was to be attributed to the state of the law.</p>
                <p>Mr G. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lamb</hi>  thought it a very serious grievance that <lb/>if a man wrote a tragedy it might be taken by any ma<lb break="no"/>nager, and performed on the stage, and the writer <lb/>brought to the miserable condition of a <hi rend="italic">damned</hi>  author <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">nolens volenns</hi>. ( <hi rend="italic">A laugh.</hi> ) The decline of dramatic <lb/>writing in this country was to be ascribed to the unpro<lb break="no"/>fitable nature of that description of writing, as compar<lb break="no"/>ed with other branches of literature ; and it would be <lb/>very desirable if a dramatic author had power to sell his <lb/>play like any other description of property, and that no <lb/>manager should perform it without paying the writer, <lb/>which was the system in France.</p>
                <p>The petition was ordered to be printed.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Birmingham Petition.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Brougham</hi>  rose to present a petition from a very <lb/>respectable body. It had been agreed to at a numerous <lb/>meeting of manufacturers, artisans, and other inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants of Birmingham, and was signed by 8000 persons <lb/>without solicitation. they contended that the distress <lb/>which now prevailed, not only had reference to that <lb/>poorer classes of society, but spread itself over the whole <lb/>system of society. This distress the petitioners ascrib<lb break="no"/>ed to the tampering that had taken place with the cur<lb break="no"/>rency. Their opinion was, that too much stress was laid <lb/>upon the panic which had taken place in 1825 ; for, <lb/>though it was true that a great number of failures had <lb/>taken place among the bankers, yet it was no less true, <lb/>that of about 70 bankers who had failed, as many as <lb/>80[?] had subsequently paid 20s in the pound. If such <lb/>were the case he was very glad to hear it. The opinion <lb/>of the petitioners rather was, that the present distress <lb/>arose from the speculations and over-trading which had <lb/>taken place ; and that such might have been the case <lb/>topitally[?], there could be no manner of doubt, That a <lb/>great deal of the distress of the nation had arisen from <lb/>the depreciation of the currency, by which people were <lb/>now paying taxes at a rate that had never been intend<lb break="no"/>ed when they were originally imposed, was extremely <lb/>likely ; but whether it operated to the extent that the <lb/>petitioners described was another question. In the year <lb/>1819 he had been one of those who had resisted the im<lb break="no"/>position of new taxes, because he thought that that was <lb/>the very worst time that Ministers could have chosen <lb/>for such an object. His opinion, however, had been <lb/>over-ruled, and the taxes had been increased. That <lb/>the effect of this must be to cripple the industry of the <lb/>country no man could doubt ; and what he wished was <lb/>to see a remedy for t ; but the misfortune was, that <lb/>after making every possible retrenchment–by reducing <lb/>salaries, and dealing in the best possible way with all <lb/>the payments which the nation had to make–the Dead <lb/>Weight would still remain round the neck of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and press it down to the effectual injury of its best <lb/>interests. How were they to get over the 800 millions <lb/>of debt, and the 30 or 40 millions of interest annually <lb/>payable thereon? In the latter part of the petition he <lb/>entirely agreed, and hoped that every thing would be <cb/>done to give the people as great relief from the pressure <lb/>of the taxes as might be consistent with a due regard to <lb/>the public credit, and the service of the State ; and so <lb/>far from treating this remedy lightly, the more he <lb/>thought that the petitioners were wrong in their obser<lb break="no"/>vations on the tampering of the currency, the more he <lb/>was inclined to listen to that part of the petition which <lb/>appeared to him to be founded on truth.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Bennett</hi>  was of opinion that the forced resto<lb break="no"/>ration of a metallic currency was one of the principal <lb/>causes of the present distress. The taxes were now <lb/>paid in money, and it now required twice the produce <lb/>to pay them which it did before the year 1819. That <lb/>was nothing less than a robbery, but how it was to be <lb/>remedied he really was at a loss to know. He would <lb/>never break faith with the public creditor, and the only <lb/>means to pay off our public debt would be to impose an <lb/>income tax. If the public debt were once removed, <lb/>then free trade could take place in every branch of <lb/>trade, but not till then. Such was the opinion of his <lb/>late friend, Mr Ricardo, and sooner or later he thought <lb/>some such measure would be resorted to.</p>
                <p>Mr Alderman <hi rend="smallcaps">Waitham</hi>  observed that it was <lb/>strange that while the public distress was admitted to <lb/>be extreme, no effort was made to reduce the public ex<lb break="no"/>penditure. He was ready to prove that the export trade <lb/>of the country had fallen off to the amount of from <lb/>nearly nine to thirteen millions, although he knew that <lb/>in saying this he was encountering serious adversaries. <lb/>He did not under-rate our export trade ; it was valuable <lb/>but for a period of thirty-one years it had fallen off at <lb/>the rate of six millions per annum ; and this could be <lb/>shewn from Parliamentary documents. With respect <lb/>to the petition now before the house, he mainly agreed <lb/>with its statements, while at the same time he could <lb/>never consent to any thing like a breach of faith with <lb/>the public creditor.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">W. Whitmore</hi>  heard with astonishment that <lb/>our foreign trade had greatly diminished, the reverse <lb/>being so notoriously the fact. Since 1814 there was <lb/>certainly a fall in the value of our manufactures, but so <lb/>there was in the raw material, and the vast increase of <lb/>machinery should also be taken into account. It was <lb/>said that our exports had declined, but facts would <lb/>prove decidedly the reverse. From 1790 to 1799, the <lb/>exports were L17,000,000 ; from 1800 to 1809, <lb/>L,26,000,000; from 1810 to 1819, L36,000,000 ; from <lb/>1821 to 1826, L45,000,000 ; in 1827, L51,000,000 ; and <lb/>in 1828 the amounts of exports rose to L52,000,000– <lb/>So much for the alleged decrease of our export trade, as <lb/>stated by the worthy Alderman, ( <hi rend="italic">hear, hear, hear.</hi> ) <lb/>In 1819[?] the currency was in the greatest state of depre<lb break="no"/>ciation ; but he begged pardon for having said so much, <lb/>and he was induced to offer a word in order to counter<lb break="no"/>act the danger which might arise if the statements of <lb/>the worthy Alderman remained unanswered.</p>
                <p>Mr Sec. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peel</hi>  observed, that, whenever any change, <lb/>however calculated to be ultimately beneficial, was made <lb/>in the system of our currency, it must be attended in <lb/>the first instance with considerable inconveniences. <lb/>The more he considered the subject, the more was he <lb/>convinced that the best interests of the nation required <lb/>that we should strictly adhere to the law of our cur<lb break="no"/>rency now established. ( <hi rend="italic">Hear, hear.</hi> ) He hoped he <lb/>should never see the time when the restrictions on cash <lb/>payments should be renewed. When, however, the <lb/>petitioners declared it to be expedient to increase the <lb/>amount of our currency by an issue of paper, he would <lb/>ask them what they would, in that case, do with the <lb/>Exchanges? If the Exchanges fell, the gold would <lb/>go out of the country. What would they do? They <lb/>must renew the restriction on cash payments by the <lb/>Bank. It was not any change in the value of the cur<lb break="no"/>rency, but the prosperity of Manchester that had occa<lb break="no"/>sioned the depression in Spitalfields. In 1820, the <lb/>number of factories in Manchester were fifty-four, and <lb/>they were assessed at the annual value of L16,816 ; in <lb/>1823 they were 56, assessed at L18,293 ; in 1826, when <lb/>the small notes bill passed, the numbers were 72, asses<lb break="no"/>sed at L24,034 ; in 1828, the year before the small <lb/>notes bill took effect, the numbers were 73, and they <lb/>were assessed at L25,245. The hon. gentleman oppo<lb break="no"/>site had said that no fresh capital had been employed <lb/>in this trade, but that persons would work at a loss ra<lb break="no"/>ther than let their machines stand idle. But if this <lb/>were the case, it would not account for the erection of <lb/>12 new factories, the establishment of which was irre<lb break="no"/>concileable with the idea of general stagnation. With <lb/>respect to the silk trade in Manchester, in 1823 there <lb/>were 2500 looms, and in 1828 there were 8000 ; and <lb/>there were between 3 and 4000 looms working ma<lb break="no"/>nufactured articles of silk mixed with cotton. He had <lb/>had a letter from Manchester, dated 1st of June, upon <lb/>which he could rely, and it stated that all the silk weav<lb break="no"/>ers were, or might be, in active emply. For the last <lb/>ten years at Manchester, machinery had improved in <lb/>powers of production in the ratio of 10 per cent, per an<lb break="no"/>num. Few persons had attributed enough to the im<lb break="no"/>portation of labourers from Ireland. A greater number <lb/>of Irish labourers in the manufacturing districts were <lb/>out of emply than people could imagine, and the Ma<lb break="no"/>gistrates relieved them rather than pass them to their <lb/>parishes, reflecting that as they had contributed to the <lb/>prosperity ot the places, they had a right to relief when <lb/>in distress. Where the passage was so low, and this <lb/>country possessed the advantage of a legal provision <lb/>for the poor, it was impossible to check the influx of <lb/>Irish labourers, and this fact would suggest important <lb/>alterations in the state of the law. ( <hi rend="italic">Hear, hear.</hi> ) He <lb/>felt convinced that any alterations with respect to the <lb/>values of the currency would be attended with the great<lb break="no"/>est evils to every class.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps"> W. Horton</hi>  observed, that some honourable <lb/>gentleman considered the distress of our artisans and <lb/>manufacturers to arise from the state of the currency ; <lb/>but he (Mr Horton) was at a loss to see how the redun<lb break="no"/>dant labour at Shipley could have been affected by the <lb/>change of the currency. Another class were the anti<lb break="no"/>podes of these–they imputed our distress to the corn <lb/>laws. But it was idle to talk of altering the corn laws; <lb/>we should look to practical remedies. As long as a re<lb break="no"/>dundancy of labour existed in England, which was ag<lb break="no"/>gravated by the condition of the Irish, who flocked to <lb/>England, and operated a still further prejudice to the <lb/>labouring class of this country, the distress would con<lb break="no"/>tinue. The remedy which he proposed for the evil he <lb/>had pointed out was emigration, in the manner propos<lb break="no"/>ed in the report of a committee of which he had the ho<lb break="no"/>nour to be the chairman, by parishes advancing a sum <lb/>of money to locate pauper labourers in our North Ame<lb break="no"/>rican colonies. The right hon. gentleman then read <lb/>opinions in approbation of his plan, from Mr Tooke, <lb/>Mr Malthus, Colonel Torrens, and others, and observ<lb break="no"/>ed that he had the opinion of the late Mr Ricardo to <lb/>the same effect, in a lette which had been published. <lb/>He then entered into a calculation, to show the saving <lb/>to parishes by this plan, and he challenged any member <lb/>of the house the show the fallacy of the calculations.– <lb/>There was, however, an answer so easy, that it was con<lb break="no"/>stantly made–" The vacuum would be filled up im<lb break="no"/>mediately." This was a delicate subject to touch <lb/>upon, for he knew not how the vacuum could be fill<lb break="no"/>ed up but by the introduction of young gentlemen <lb/>and ladies. ( <hi rend="italic">A laugh</hi>.) But was it supposed that <lb/>fifty labourers would be replaced immediately by fifty <lb/>children? Or did these objectors suppose that labour<lb break="no"/>ers would be brought from Russia or elsewhere ? The <lb/>right honourable gentleman then adverted to the re<lb break="no"/>marks in Mr Sadler's work, wherein it was stated that <lb/>is appeared from the official documents that the mor<lb break="no"/> 
               <cb/>tality amongst the emigrants to North America had <lb/>been in the unprecedented proportion of 4 in 14, where<lb break="no"/>as, in Wales, the proportion was 1 in 69, and in Eng<lb break="no"/>land, 1 in 57. This, he would assert, was an incorrect <lb/>statement. So far from the proportion being 1 in 14, <lb/>it was only 1 in 40, the same proportion which existed <lb/>in Carlisle, the healthiest place in England. The emi<lb break="no"/>grants, it should be recollected, carried out children, <lb/>and the mortality amongst children was in the propor<lb break="no"/>tion of 1 in 12, and in London much greater ; for it had <lb/>been ascertained that out of 1,000 infants amongst the <lb/>poor, only 542 survived the period of nursing. The <lb/>right hon. gentleman concluded with reading his last <lb/>resolution–" That it is expedient that such measures <lb/>should be adopted in the next Session of Parliament as <lb/>may furnish the most safe and effectual means of pro<lb break="no"/>ducing the desird improvement, by a judicious appli<lb break="no"/>cation of both these principles, and at the same time <lb/>under conditions which will prevent the probability of <lb/>a recurrence of similar evils, and also effect a material <lb/>saving of the national income, instead of producing an <lb/>increased charge thereon."</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Huskisson</hi>  contended that colonization ought <lb/>to be encouraged. Had it not been for emigration, <lb/>this country could never have reached its present state <lb/>of importance and prosperity, nor would our language <lb/>have been extended to the United States, and been <lb/>adopted in more distant countries. If there were one <lb/>circumstance more striking than another, it was the pro<lb break="no"/>digious increase of consumption, a proof of the growing <lb/>wealth and resources of the country. In the year 1814, <lb/>the exchange in trade was against us ; now it was in <lb/>our favour. This country would carry on its great affairs <lb/>with as small a portion of metallic currency as possi<lb break="no"/>ble, but let them guard against a system which had led <lb/>to depreciation of the currency, and the panic which <lb/>was felt in 1825. He had heard somewhere a meta<lb break="no"/>phor respecting paper currency. Like a skyrocket, it <lb/>rose with splendour, but lost its brightness, and when <lb/>its fire was extinguished it fell in darkness, like the <lb/>shaft of the rocket, upon the heads of those who had <lb/>raised it.</p>
                <p>Mr Secretary <hi rend="smallcaps">Peel</hi>  said, in consequence of the <lb/>course of policy which he had deemed it advisable to <lb/>adopt in the previous Session, a series of unfounded ca<lb break="no"/>lumnies had been levelled at him, which, however, he <lb/>had despised too much to condescend to notice. But <lb/>there was one which, as it reflected on his public and <lb/>official character, he would, with permission of the <lb/>house, allude to on that occasion. The report to which <lb/>he alluded was, that he had used his influence as Secre<lb break="no"/>tary of State to procure an enormous grant of land <lb/>for a relative of his. ( <hi rend="italic">Hear, hear, hear.</hi> ) In conse<lb break="no"/>quence of seeing this report in the public newspapers, <lb/>he had requested his right honourable friend to move <lb/>in that house, for the production of certain papers cal<lb break="no"/>culted to explain the whole matter. Those papers <lb/>had in consequence been produced, and were now <lb/>printed ; he trusted, however, that the house would <lb/>excuse him for again alluding to the subject. ( <hi rend="italic">Hear, </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">hear, hear.</hi> ) He hoped that the consequence of those <lb/>papers being printed would have been, that some mem<lb break="no"/>ber would have asked some questions on the subject ; <lb/>but though this was not the case, he had received a <lb/>communication which made him think that some one <lb/>out of doors had been imposed upon by the calumny, <lb/>though no member of that house had been so deceived, <lb/>( <hi rend="italic">cheering</hi>.) He begged in the first place, to state <lb/>most distinctly that he had procured no grant of land <lb/>for any brother of his, ( <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> ) A gentleman, whose <lb/>name was the same as his, and who was his second <lb/>cousin, had had a grant made him by his right hon. <lb/>friend ; but in that grant he begged to state to the <lb/>house, upon his word of honour, as a gentleman, he had <lb/>had no participation whatever, ( <hi rend="italic">hear</hi>.) With respect <lb/>to the settlement on the Swan River, he was ashamed <lb/>to say that he had neither heard nor knew of it, till he <lb/>received a letter from his cousin, announcing to him <lb/>that he had abandoned the idea of going to New South <lb/>Wales ; and that from the circumstances of Mr Twiss in<lb break="no"/>forming him that government would be disposed to afford <lb/>assistance to any settlers going to the Swan River, he <lb/>and three other gentlemen had been induced to send in <lb/>a proposal to that effect. With respect to the other <lb/>calumnies which had been promulgated against him, <lb/>they rather went to private matters, and he had there<lb break="no"/>fore not condescended to notice them ; but as this one <lb/>had reference to the public department in which he of<lb break="no"/>ficiated, he had thought it so far a public concern, as <lb/>to venture to ask the attention of the house while he tres<lb break="no"/>passed on it to disclaim any participation in the grant <lb/>that had been made, ( <hi rend="italic">hear.</hi>.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">Geo. Murray</hi> –The house would probably <lb/>think, after the statement of his right honourable friend, <lb/>that it would be unnecessary for him to rise to address <lb/>them, ( <hi rend="italic">hear</hi>.) He was satisfied that the house knew <lb/>that his right hon. friend was incapable of proposing <lb/>anything that would come under the designation of <lb/>what was vulgarly called a job, ( <hi rend="italic">hear</hi>.)</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Adjournment.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Mr Secretary <hi rend="smallcaps">Peel</hi>  gave notice that he should to<lb break="no"/>morrow move the adjournment of the house to that day <lb/>week. The right hon. gentleman at the same time <lb/>presented a petition from the Apothecaries Company <lb/>of London, in favour, as we understood, of the bill re<lb break="no"/>garding dissection.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Wilmot Horton</hi>  rose to propose the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions of wich he had given notic relative to the state <lb/>of the labouring poor.</p>
                <p>The firt resolution having been put from the chair,</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Chancellor</hi>  of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Exchequer</hi>  moved as <lb/>an amendment that the order of the day be now read.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Bennett</hi>  opposed the resolutions.</p>
                <p>The amendement was agreed to without a division.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Labouchere</hi>  postponed until to-morrow his <lb/>motion respecting Canada.</p>

            </p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Otway Cave</hi>  moved the following resolutions:</p>
                <p>"Resolved, 1st. That no human legislature has any <lb/>lawful power to abridge or destroy the natural rights <lb/>of life and liberty, unless the owner shall himself com<lb break="no"/>mit some criminal act that amounts to a forfeiture.</p>

                <p>"3. That it is the especial duty of this House, as the <lb/>Representatives of the people, to take effectual measures <lb/>for protecting all British subjects that shall be born <lb/>henceforward in the West Indian Colonies, from simi<lb break="no"/>lar violations of their natural, inherent, and paramount <lb/>rights as human beings."</p>
                <p>The motion being seconded by <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Lumley,</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">W. Smith</hi>  said, he could not give his support to <lb/>these resolutions, because they were connected with a <lb/>question of too much importance to be agitated in such <lb/>a manner, and at such a period of the Session.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Huskisson</hi>  was of opinion that resolutions of <lb/>such a description as those brought forward by the hon. <lb/>member, ought to be met by a direct negative.</p>
                <p>Strangers were then ordered to withdraw. The reso<lb break="no"/>lutions were declared to be negatived without a division.</p>
                <p>The other orders of the day were then disposed of, and <lb/>the house adjourned at half-past one o'clock.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">The King.</hi> –We are happy to learn from a private <lb/>source of unquestionable authenticity, that the King <lb/>has seldom, if ever, in his whole life, enjoyed better <lb/>health than at the present moment. From the same <lb/>quarter we have received a confirmation of what we <lb/>mentioned some time back, that according to the present <lb/>arrangements of the Court, it is certainly his Majesty's <lb/>intetion to visit Brighton before the expiration of the <lb/>year.– <hi rend="italic">Brighton Gazette.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The Revenne.</hi> –Ever since the beginning of the quar<lb break="no"/>ter, symptoms of progressive improvement have mani<lb break="no"/>fested themselves in the revenue. Of late they have <lb/>assumed a more decided and promising character, and if <lb/>the seven weeks that remain prove as productive as the <lb/>first month has been, not only will thre be no falling <lb/>off at the close, but a considerable increase may confi<lb break="no"/>dently be anticipated. We understand that the general <lb/>return of duties paid at Custom-house in the port of <lb/>London, for the month o July last, amounts to one <lb/>million one hundred and ten thousand pounds. The re<lb break="no"/>turns from the out-ports have not all yet been received, <lb/>but, on a fair calculation, it is supposed that they will <lb/>amount to above one million sterling.– <hi rend="italic">Courier.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>It is certainly true that Laurent made an offer of <lb/>L8000 a year for Covent Garden ; but when asked to <lb/>put his offer into writing, he withdrew, and nothing <lb/>more has been heard of it.– <hi rend="italic">Court Journal.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>The new musical entertainment forthcoming at the <lb/>English Opera House, to be called <hi rend="italic">The Spring Lock, </hi>
               <lb/>is founded upon one of the fictions of an early Italian <lb/>novelist (Lasca), the incidents of which almost include <lb/>the romatic and eventful interest of the Arabian Nights' <lb/>Entertainments. Peake is the accredited author–Keeley <lb/>is to be the hero, and Wood the principal vocalist ; G. <lb/>H. Rodwell is the composer.</p>
                <p>It is stated in a recent French paper, that during the <lb/>last eight months not fewer than twenty political and <lb/>literary journals have been started in the French pro<lb break="no"/>vinces.</p>
                <p>It is stated in a French newspaper than an inhabitant <lb/>of Lyon grafted upon the same stem red and white <lb/>grapes, and peaches, and apricots, which all flowered at <lb/>the same time, and gave ripe fruit with a few days of <lb/>each other.</p>
                <p>A carriage, containing 60 persons, was this day seen <lb/>to traverse Paris. It was drawn by six horses, merely <lb/>by way of trial. This carriage and several simi<lb break="no"/>lat ones are building in the square of St Salpier. They <lb/>are to run between Paris and Lyons.– <hi rend="italic">Paris Paper.</hi>

                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Steam Navigation.</hi> –Information has reached the <lb/>India House, that the East India Company's steam<lb break="no"/>vessel Enterprise will leave Bombay on the 15th of No<lb break="no"/>vember next, for Suez, where she may be expected to <lb/>arrive early in December. Another steam-vessel is to <lb/>leave Bombay for the same destination in January next. <lb/>A communication by steam between this country and <lb/>the Mediterrarean has already been opened, and might, <lb/>we suppose, be easily extended to Egpyt. The expense <lb/>of such a speculation would probably be amply com<lb break="no"/>pensated by the profit of conveying by so desirable a <lb/>route passengers to and from the East Indies.</p>
                <p>His Majesy the King of Prussia has honoured Mr <lb/>by presenting him with a splendid gold snuff<lb break="no"/>box, as a token of his Majesty's approbation of Bel<lb break="no"/>shazzar's Feast." the "Dalage."&amp;c. <cb/>
               <hi rend="italic">Swan River.</hi> –That beautiful ship, the Gilmour, <lb/>sailed on Monday evening for the Swan River. She <lb/>has upwards of 200 passengers on board, the whole of <lb/>whom are highly respectable, and many of them are in <lb/>opulent circumstances. When Mr Peel came alongside <lb/>(accompanied by Mr Soltau), just before the ship got <lb/>under weigh, the passengers and crew gave him three <lb/>cheers, and his reception altogether was of the most <lb/>gratifying description. The property on board the <lb/>Gilmore alone amounts to the more than L60,000. We <lb/>understand also, that the Minstrel will call at this port <lb/>in about a fortnight to take out other settlers on ac<lb break="no"/>count of Mr Peel. We are informed that Government <lb/>have increased Mr Peel's grant of land from 350,000 <lb/>to 1,000,000 acres.– <hi rend="italic">Plymouth Journal.</hi>

                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Gurney's Steam Carriage.</hi> –Yesterday afternoon Mr <lb/>Gurney's steam carriage was exhibited, at the request <lb/>of the Duke of Wellington, in the Houslow Barrack <lb/>yard, before his Grave, the Ladies Percy, Dance, and <lb/>Murray ; Lords Fitzroy Somerset, Rosslyn, and Tho<lb break="no"/>mas Cecil ; Lieut. General Sir W. Gordon, Quarter<lb break="no"/>Master General ; Sir George Murray, Sir Charles Dance, <lb/>and a large number of military and scientific gentlemen. <lb/>His Grace, Sir W. Gordon, the Ladies Percy, &amp;c. had <lb/>a carriage attacked, and rode round the yard with the <lb/>greatest pleasure and satisfaction. Afterwards a wag<lb break="no"/>gon was fastened to the steam carriage containing 27 <lb/>soldiers besides Mr Gurney and two or three men on <lb/>the engine, and though the road was very disadvanta<lb break="no"/>geous, being a rough loose sand and gravel, it drew <lb/>them round without the least diminuition of its speed, <lb/>between nine and ten miles an hour. In these experi<lb break="no"/>ments Mr Gurney applied his steam generally but to <lb/>one wheel in order to give the company full proof of <lb/>the power and practicability of the invention. Having <lb/>satisfied them as to this, and as to its manageability, <lb/>by a variety of involutions and evolutions, he gave them <lb/>a specimen of its speed, and drove seven or eight times <lb/>round at the rate of 16 or 17 miles an hour. It is <lb/>difficult to say whether the company was more pleased <lb/>or surprised at these unequivocal proofs of Mr Gurney's <lb/>success. The Duke of Wellington observed that it <lb/>was scarcely possible to calculate the benefits we should <lb/>derive from the introduction of such an invention as <lb/>this.</p>
                <p>The French papers of Tuesday state that the Em<lb break="no"/>peror Nicholas was preparing to make a new levy at the <lb/>rate of 4 upon every 500 male individuals, which would <lb/>give about 160,000 fresh soldiers. He is said, however, to <lb/>have deferred promulgating the ukase until he should <lb/>have ascertained that the Porte had definitely rejected <lb/>the terms of peace which he had proposed. On the <lb/>other hand, we are told that the Sultan has rejected those <lb/>terms, and that, notwithstanding the successes gained <lb/>by the Russians, he was resolved to run all the chances <lb/>of a desperate struggle rather than submit to conditions <lb/>which he deemed insulting.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The English Bench.</hi> –There are two vacancies at <lb/>present on the judicial Bench ;–one occasioned by the <lb/>death of Mr Baron Hullock ; the other by the more <lb/>recent decease of Mr Charles Warren, Chief Justice of <lb/>Chester, who expired at his house in Bedford Square, <lb/>on Wednesday afternoon, in the 66th year of his age. <lb/>Mr Campbell is spoken of as the successor of the for<lb break="no"/>mer ; and the choise, we supposem will be generally <lb/>deemed to be a proper one. With respect to the Chief <lb/>Justiceship of Chester, an evening paer, the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi>, very <lb/>properly recalls to public recollection the fact, that "the <lb/>Commissioners on the Common Law had recommended <lb/>in their report, the abolition of the Welsh judgeships <lb/>altogether;" and adds an opinion, in which we per<lb break="no"/>fectly coincide, tht " the present seems a fair op<lb break="no"/>portunity for carrying the recommendation into effect." <lb/>Indeed, in our mind, every opportunity is a fair one <lb/>for reducing public expences, when public burdens are <lb/>oppressive.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Platina Coin.</hi> –We have seen a specimen of the <lb/>new Russian platina coinage. The coin is about the <lb/>size of a shilling, but heavier than a sovereign, and of <lb/>three roubles value. On one side are the Russian eagle <lb/>and imperial arms; on the other the value of the coin, <lb/>and date– <hi rend="italic">Globe.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Ugly Wives Fittest for Poets.</hi> –The spouses of the <lb/>living British poets are well known to be among the plain<lb break="no"/>est of the <hi rend="italic">sect</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">Mr Slinslop</hi>  would say.–is wed<lb break="no"/>ded to the head of a gorgon, – – is not much better <lb/>off, – – has eloped from his mate. We might run <lb/>through the whole catalogue, without discovering a <lb/>handsome woman, yet none have exceleed these writers <lb/>in descriptions of female beauty. The truth is, that <lb/>the contemplation of a bottle or peaked nose, a wide <lb/>mouth, goggle eyes, and a spare body, causes an author <lb/>to set out with more enthusiasm in search of the ideal <lb/>of womanly perfections, and affords the widest scope to <lb/>the imagination. Nothing impedes the fancy more <lb/>domestic intercourse with a celestial shape and di<lb break="no"/>vine face ; in which case a fatal uxoriousness supersedes <lb/>the poet's diligence, and he ceases impotently to de<lb break="no"/>scribe what he can well enjoy. Milton's Eve was not <lb/>copied from Mrs Milton grilling his dinner at the kitch<lb break="no"/>en fire–but from some unattainable damsel of his fan<lb break="no"/>cy. Plurality of women is only allowed to a poet– <lb/>one lawful, plain, household wife–and as many airy <lb/>mistresses as he can embody.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Swan River.</hi> –The ship Warrior, Stone, command<lb break="no"/>er, bound to Swan River, Sydney, and the East Indies, <lb/>sailed for her destination on Friday, from Portsmouth, <lb/>with prospects of favourable weather in her progress <lb/>down the Channel. The Warrior is a fine vessel of <lb/>about 700 tons burden, and carried out upwards of 250 <lb/>passengers to the new settlement. Several of the pas<lb break="no"/>sengers are persons of independent fortune, who have <lb/>embarked considerable property in the speculation ; and <lb/>and two ofthem, named Byrne and Molloy, paid the <lb/>enormous sum of L1,000 for the best accommodation <lb/>the vessel could afford their families and suite. Six <lb/>pianos are on board the Warrior, and a proportionate <lb/>number of fair and accomplished vocalists and musicians <lb/>of course accompany the instruments to their destina<lb break="no"/>tion. The Warrior has also on board fifty dogs of the <lb/>choicest breed, several pens of sheep, considerable <lb/>number of swine, two milch cows, and three valuable <lb/>horses ; but, as tempestuous weather may be antici<lb break="no"/>pated on the vessel reaching the Bay of Biscay, appre<lb break="no"/>hensions are entertained that a portion of the live cargo <lb/>must be consigned to the ocean before the termination <lb/>of the voyage. It is calculated that, from the advan<lb break="no"/>tageous arrangements entered into by the commander <lb/>and a gentleman named Semple, who has chartered the <lb/>Warrior, and gone out in her, they will clear the enor<lb break="no"/>mous sum of L10,000 by the voyage.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">The King's Health.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>It will be seen from our private letter, that unfavou<lb break="no"/>rable accounts respecting his Majesty's health were cir<lb break="no"/>culating in London at 7 o'clock on Wednesday even<lb break="no"/>ing. In our last we alluded to the suspicions which <lb/>the non-appearance of bulletins for four days after the <lb/>first, gave rise to. On Monday a second bulletin ap<lb break="no"/>peared, certainly not of a character to remove the pub<lb break="no"/>lic anxiety, and this has been followed by two days' <lb/>silence. Every one naturally puts the question, "If <lb/>his Majesty is better, why not state this in a bulletin, <lb/>that the thousand discouraging rumours in circulation <lb/>may be put to rest?" The <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle </hi>
               <lb/>says, that the high officers of State are not much <lb/>better informed on the subject than others, and that <lb/>a knowledge of his Majesty's real condition is <lb/>confined to the very few immediately around his <lb/>person. In the absence of correct information, infe<lb break="no"/>rences are drawn from every passing circumstance. It <lb/>was observed that Sir Henry Halford very shortly after <lb/>his return from Windsor on Tuesday morning had a <lb/>long interview with the Duke of Wellington ; and it <lb/>has not escaped notice, that his Majesty's sister, the <lb/>Duchess of Gloucester, had been sent for to visit him. <lb/>The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>  says, that according to reports which are <lb/>circulated in high quarters, his Majesty's illness ex<lb break="no"/>cites considerable alarm, and that gout in the <lb/>stomach is complicated with dropsical symptoms. <lb/>What credit may be due to these statements, we <lb/>cannot tell; but whether they be true or false, <lb/>they furnish a reason for the publication of offi<lb break="no"/>cial intelligence. The King's health is a matter <lb/>which concerns the public deeply, and all mystery and <lb/>deception on the subject are most reprehensible. We <lb/>refer to our London head for a variety of articles upon <lb/>the subject ; and if this night's mail bring any addi<lb break="no"/>tional information of importance we shall publish it <lb/>in a secoond edition.</p>
                <p>The two Houses of Parliament meet again on <lb/>Monday.</p>
                <p>We publish the address of the Birmingham Union <lb/>to day, and meant to accompany it with some remarks, <lb/>but have only time at present to express out regret <lb/>that so masterly a paper, dealing in great and immu<lb break="no"/>table principles, should have its value lessened by <lb/>being so much mixed up with ephemeral matters, and <lb/>with false or questionable doctrines respecting cur<lb break="no"/>rency.</p>
                <p>The passion for emigrating to Swan River has not <lb/>received any check. There are four ships now at Lon<lb break="no"/>don, and as many more at other ports, which are pre<lb break="no"/>paring to sail for the settlement with passengers. In<lb break="no"/>deed the numbers who are flying from the country at <lb/>this moment who are, we believe, quite unprecedented. <lb/>Within the last ten days we have seen notices of fifteen <lb/>ships that were loading with emigrants at Hull, twelve <lb/>at Waterford, and several at Bristol, Liverpool, and <cb/>Greenock, all destined, we think, for the United States, <lb/>or British America. The exportation of human beings <lb/>from the British Isles, to different quarters of the <lb/>world, must now be proceeding at the rate of one or <lb/>two thousand per week.</p>
                <p>It will be remembered, that according to reports <lb/>from India received some time ago, Lord William <lb/>Bentick had issued an order, abolishing those horrid <lb/>human sacrifices, the <hi rend="italic">Suttees</hi>. Doubts were thrown <lb/>upon this intelligence when the subject was lately <lb/>talked of in Parliament ; but we are happy to say, that <lb/>its accuracy is confirmed by the arrival of the official <lb/>document. It is disgraceful to the British Indian Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, that it has been hitherto either so callous, <lb/>that it overlooked this enormity, or so ignorant of its <lb/>own resources, and the true state of the people under <lb/>its authority, as to believe that it had not power to <lb/>effect its abolition.</p>
                <p>The report of a revolution having taken place in <lb/>Chili, is confirmed in letters from Bogota. The <lb/>constitutional Director, Pinto, has been driven out of <lb/>the capital by General Prieto with an armed force, and <lb/>great excesses are said to have been committed.</p>
                <p>A small fleet sailed lately from Cadiz for Havannah, <lb/>with 2000 soldiers on board. The expedition is sup<lb break="no"/>posed by some to be intended for the invasion of <lb/>Mexico ; but it is more likely to find employment in <lb/>keeping down the elements of insurrection in Cuba– <lb/>The plot to which we alluded in our last, seems to have <lb/>excited much alarm. Some of the most opulent fa<lb break="no"/>milies in the island, with several lawyers and official <lb/>persons, were concerned in it. Their object was, as we <lb/>conjectured, to convert the island into an independent <lb/>republic.</p>
                <p>From a detailed list published in the French papers, <lb/>it appears that the expedition against Algiers is to be <lb/>composed of 34,000 men, infantry, cavalray, and artil<lb break="no"/>lery.</p>
                <p>Farther intelligence has been received from the ca<lb break="no"/>pital of Colombia to the 14th of February. A warm <lb/>address had been presented by the Congress to Bolivar, <lb/>entreating him not to abandon the republic at a mo<lb break="no"/>ment when its existence was menaced by conspiracies; <lb/>and he seems to have once more consented to remain <lb/>in office. Commissioners had been appointed to pro<lb break="no"/>ceed to Valentia, and endeavour to accomodate the <lb/>differences between the people of Venezuela and the <lb/>central government, by peaceable means. If these <lb/>failed it was determined to employ force. The Congress <lb/>was in session at Bogota, and was proceeding to fulfil the <lb/>object for which it had been assembled, by drawing up <lb/>a new constitution. The bases are published, and though <lb/>the present only an imperfect sketch of its plan, <lb/>they disclose one or two features which seem to be cha<lb break="no"/>racteristic. The government is to be <hi rend="italic">central</hi>, as it has <lb/>hitherto been, not <hi rend="italic">federal</hi>  like that of the United States, <lb/>which has served as a model to Mexico, Guatemala, <lb/>and La Plata. In the one case the supreme authority <lb/>is vested in a single legislature, which meets in the ca<lb break="no"/>pital ; in the other it is divided among a number of <lb/>local assemblies, while the general congress represent<lb break="no"/>ing the whole, wields no other powers than what is ne<lb break="no"/>cessary to hold the separate members in a state of <lb/>union. The federal system, which leaves to every pro<lb break="no"/>vince the management of its own concerns, has ad<lb break="no"/>vantages for a settled and enlightened community ; but <lb/>whether it is equally adapted to the circumstances of <lb/>an ignorant people newly escaped from political con<lb break="no"/>vulsions, is very questionable. There seems, how<lb break="no"/>ever, to be a partiality for the federal system in the <lb/>new world ; and to humour this feeling, the new con<lb break="no"/>stitution provides, that "Chambers of Districts" shall <lb/>be established, with powers to decide on all municipal <lb/>and local affairs. The difficulty will be, to give these <lb/>bodies the powers necessary to develope the industry <lb/>and resources of the country, without permitting them <lb/>to impose taxes, and exercise other legislative functions, <lb/>which will interfere with the business of the general <lb/>government. Another articl state, that the members <lb/>of the Senate and House of Representatives are to hold <lb/>their seats for a considerable time, in order " to avoid <lb/>the inconveniences resulting from frequent changes, or <lb/>the repeated election of the same person." In the <lb/>mouth of an English statesman, we should consider <lb/>this vile sophistry ; but allowance must be made <lb/>for the <hi rend="italic">res dur? novitas regni</hi>, in a new <lb/>state like Colombia, formed of heterogenous ele<lb break="no"/>ments, among which it is not easy to establish <lb/>any principle of cohesion. One the same grouns, the <lb/>Columbian legislators may be pardoned for resolving <lb/>that the Catholic religion is that of the state, and that <lb/>no other shall be permitted. This is merely a conces<lb break="no"/>cession for the sake of peace, to prejudice which the <lb/>government is not strong enough to subdue, and can<lb break="no"/>not defy without great danger. Nothing is said about <lb/>the mode of election, or the power of the President, two <lb/>points of vital consequence, which may give a new <lb/>complexion to the whole scheme. We have made <lb/>these remarks on the proposed constitution, because it <lb/>probably holds out the last chance of composing the <lb/>trouble of Columbia. If it does not satisfy the people <lb/>other provinces will soon follow the example of Vene<lb break="no"/>zuela, and all the address and influence of Bolivar will <lb/>not prevent the republic from splitting into four or <lb/>five independent communities, whose mutual jealousness <lb/>and wars will crush the librties, and destroy the pro<lb break="no"/>sperity of the whole.</p>

               <lb/>This afternoon the first sale of wools for a long time <lb/>past took place at Garraway's Coffee-house. The <lb/>quantity announced for sale to-day was nearly 200 bales, <lb/>consisting of about 100 bales of New South Wales <lb/>wool, 50 bales of Van Dieman's Land wools, &amp;c. The <lb/>New South Wales wool was first put up and went off <lb/>very briskly at prices averaging from 1s 4 1/2d to 1s 10d <lb/>per lb., which quotations are higher than those last <lb/>obtained. The Van Dieman's Land wools were sold <lb/>by order of the Van Dieman's Land Company, being <lb/>a portion of the last arrivals from the Company's flocks. <lb/>They met a very ready sale, and the average prices ob<lb break="no"/>tained were from 1s 5d to 2s 1d per lb. The arrivals <lb/>from Germany and other places this year are expected <lb/>to be very great.</p>

               <pb/>THE EQUALITY OF SEXES.–The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>  of Sa<lb break="no"/>turday las has some witty remarks on the plaint which <lb/>appeared in our paper on the excess of females over <lb/>males in the census, which he assures us is entirely <lb/>owing to the lives of females being prolonged by their <lb/>better regularity. This is a sly censure upon the ha<lb break="no"/>bit of our countrymen, one-fifth, or sixth part of whom <lb/>we were supposed by implication to be cut off perma<lb break="no"/>nently by intemperance! We admit that a few hearty <lb/>fellows do go off in apoplexy; but we deny that the <lb/>number bears any proportion to the amount supposed; <lb/>we have two other remarks to make on his state<lb break="no"/>ment. First, since our manners were corrupted by im<lb break="no"/>itating <hi rend="italic">English</hi>  fashions, it is whispered, we hope un<lb break="no"/>, that there are such things as tippling women in <lb/>country, some of whom do disappear suddenly–no <lb/>matter how; and secondly, we wish our London friend <lb/>inform us how it happens, that while all Broad <lb/>England has only an excess of 11 1/2 per cent females, <lb/>Edinburgh should have no less than 24! We under<lb break="no"/>stand that since this astounding fact was brought out, <lb/>there has been a great efflux of ladies from the city to <lb/>the adjoining counties. We know a number who have <lb/>or are flying to Fife and the north. A friend, who <lb/>careful observer, compares it to the dispersion of <lb/>the Jews.

            </p>
                <p>Botany Bay serves as a recipient for criminals whose <lb/>reformation is hopeless, and whom it is therefore desir<lb break="no"/>able to remove from the Society to whose peace and se<lb break="no"/>curity they are sworn enemies. This is the sole value <lb/>of the colony. If it did not exist, recourse would be <lb/>had more frequently to perpetual imprisonment and the <lb/>gibbet. Experience shews, however, that transportation <lb/>does not produce the intended effect of terrifying the <lb/>guilty. Its monitory operation depends greatly on the <lb/>situation of the criminal. "Agricultural labourers <lb/>with families dread it extremely, while to single men, <lb/>mechanics who are sure of receiving high wages, and <lb/>generally to all those who feel a desire of change, and a <lb/>vague expectation of pushing their fortunes, it appears <lb/>to hold out no terrors whatever." In the colony there <lb/>is a competition among settlers to obtain convinct <lb/>servants, and those who get them, endeavour, from <lb/>a regard to their own interest to render the situation <lb/>of the convicts as little irksome as possible. The <lb/>evidence proves, that when the feeling degrada<lb break="no"/>tion is once overcome, the situation of the Australian <lb/>convict "is, in many respects, preferable to that of <lb/>the agricultural labourer in this country :" He <lb/>has better clothing, more abundant food, and en<lb break="no"/>joys a finer climate. The hardship, too, of compulsory <lb/>labour is but for a limited time. The convict who is <lb/>transported for 7 years, is allowed a Ticket of Leave, <lb/>at the end of 8years. Once possessed of this <lb/>ticket he is allowed to work on his own account, and <lb/>with high wages, easily acquires capital. The com<lb break="no"/>mittee see little chance of rendering punishment effec<lb break="no"/>tive in the colony. They recommend various subordi<lb break="no"/>nate regulations, and among others, they suggest as a <lb/>remedy for the great expense attending transportation, <lb/>that no convict be assigned to a settler until he shall <lb/>have paid, or given security for the payment by instal<lb break="no"/>ments, of the expense incurred in the conveyance of <lb/>the convict from the mother country.</p>
                <p>We are satisfied that the true check to the increase <lb/>of crime is to be found, first, in the diffusion of educa<lb break="no"/>tion and sound knowledge ; and, second, in the improve<lb break="no"/>ment of our judicial and municipal institutions. Law, <lb/>in all its important branches, should be dispensed by <lb/>paid and responsible persons. A judge ought to <lb/>be stationed in each small district, and keep open <lb/>court every day of the year. He should be chosen <lb/>by some popular constituency, which would faithfully <lb/>represent the feelings of the mass of suitors; and <lb/>as a guarantee for his diligence, he should hold his <lb/>office only for seven years, and be re-eligible. Jus<lb break="no"/>tices of Peace, if retained at all, should be elected <lb/>as in most of the American states, by the householders <lb/>for three, four, or seven years. Jails also, should be <lb/>placed under the controul of popular bodies, and thrown <lb/>open to the improving efforts of private benevolence. <lb/>In this, as in other points, we have much to learn from <lb/>the Americans, who never forget that the criminal is still <lb/>a man. The grand defect in our legislation has been, <lb/>that the rich made laws for the poor, of whose situation <lb/>they had scarcely any knowledge, and with whose feel<lb break="no"/>ings, wants, and moral condition, they had of course no <lb/>sympathy. The unpaid Magistracy of Britain is a bar<lb break="no"/>barism belonging to the tenth century. Thirty years <lb/>hence men will wonder how their forefathers tolerated <lb/>so monstrous a system.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Wool</hi> –The accounts received in Lond from New <lb/>South Wales to the 8th of January, state that the produce <lb/>of the last year's clip of wool in Australia will be greatest <lb/>than that of the preceding year, and the the quali<lb break="no"/>ty has also considerably improved. From Van Die<lb break="no"/>man's Land it is now ascertained that the supply this <lb/>year will be short, but the general quality is very supe<lb break="no"/>rior. In the course of about a week or ten days, large <lb/>arrivals of wool are looked for from New South Wales <lb/>and the private contract business is expected to be very <lb/>active. The public sales of wools went off on Friday <lb/>very well, and at full prices. The arrivals of this week <lb/>have consisted of about 708 bales, of which about 292 <lb/>bales were Van Dieman's Land wools, and the rest Ger<lb break="no"/>man. There is a steady demand, and as it is under<lb break="no"/>stood that the manufacturers are short of stock, the an<lb break="no"/>ticipations are that trade will son be greatly improved.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">York Wool Market, May</hi>  23.–The market com<lb break="no"/>menced here for this season this day, with only a small <lb/>show of wool, and not many buyers. The holders ask<lb break="no"/>ing very high prices caused part to be left unsold. <lb/>The following are the prices ; Hogs from 18s to 19s ; <lb/>Hogs and Ewes 16s 6d to 17s 6d ; Locks 11s to <lb/>12s, 6d per stone of 16lbs.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Bradford Market</hi> –The supply of Merinos in the <lb/>markets on Thursday evening, was by no means equal <lb/>to the demand–all qualities in six quarter wide Me<lb break="no"/>rinoes were eagerly bought up, and in some instances <lb/>a farther advance was obtained ; three quarter wide <lb/>Merinoes run much in demand, but a very scanty sup<lb break="no"/>ply ; the advance on six quarter wide Merinoes is from <lb/>4s to 6s per piece, compared with what was given at <lb/>the beginning of the year, and three quarter wide are <lb/>proportionably higher. Unless a reduction takes place <lb/>in the price of wool, the manufacturers state they must <lb/>have a further advance.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Rochdale Flannel Market.</hi> –The market today was <lb/>very lively for this season of the yar ; low goods both <lb/>for white and for dyeing were of very ready sale, and <lb/>in some instances a little advance was obtained ; several <lb/>sales were effected in fine qualities, and if the demand <lb/>proves permanent, the prospect for the coming season is <lb/>very promising.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">The Wool Trade.</hi> –The whole of the London public <lb/>sales of Colonial and other woold having now been <lb/>gone through, the wool trade is in a more settled state, <lb/>and transactions by private contract are conducted on a <lb/>more extensive scale. The total amount of the late <lb/>sales, the last of which took place on Tuesday, was <lb/>4,000 bales, and the colonial wools were taken by the <lb/>manufactures at the extreme advance realized at the <lb/>previous sales in July. In some cases, indeed, quota<lb break="no"/>tions from 2d to 3d per lb. in advance were obtained. <lb/>The sales on Saturday was most fully attended, and in<lb break="no"/>creased boldness was observed. The colonial wools <lb/>offered on that day fetched excellent prices. Some few <lb/>bales were also offered, forming a part of the second <lb/>clip of wools in the new colony on the Swan River. <lb/>They were much better in quality than those last re<lb break="no"/>ceived. Some German lambs' wool also commanded <lb/>attention, and sold as high as 3s 10d to 4s per lb. The <lb/>sale on Tuesday (the last of the series,) was not quite <lb/>so fully attended as those of last wekk, but, according <lb/>to quality, full prices were obtained. The sale consisted <lb/>of 437 bales New South Wales and Van Diemen's <lb/>Land wool, 96 bales of Portugal wool, 54 Spanish, and <lb/>72 bales of Cape, German, Russian, and other wools. <lb/>The best fleece of Amsterdam offered fetched 2s 10d to <lb/>3s 2d, and seconds 2s 3d to 2s 7 1/2d per lb ; the <lb/>best Portugal 1s 2d to 1s 11d ; the best Spanish 2s 5d <lb/>to 2s 8d ; the best Cape 1s 4d to 1s 8d ; the best Van <lb/>Diemen's Land 1s 8d to 1s 10d ; and the best German <lb/>2s to 2s 3d per lb. The result of these sales is to esta<lb break="no"/>blish a much firmer market for wools of all descriptions <lb/>than previously existed. The arrivals of wool are <lb/>limited, and this week only 575 bales of German wool, <lb/>and abotu 375 bales of Neapolitan wool have been en<lb break="no"/>tered at the custom house.</p>

            </p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="enlarged-capital">T</hi> he subject of emigration is rising in importance <lb/>from year to year, and cannot lose its interest as long <lb/>as much misery or much discontent exists among our <lb/>working classes. Upper Canada, the great recipient of <lb/>our surplus population, is 4000 miles from Britain, a <lb/>distance which looks extremely formidable ; but such <lb/>is the amazing economy of water carriage, when se<lb break="no"/>conded by good arrangements, that the voyage by sea <lb/>to Montreal can be made at as small expense as the <lb/>journey by land to Manchester ! The passage money <lb/>from Dublin to Montreal or Quebec (exclusive of food) <lb/>has been as low as 30s ; and it would not be higher <lb/>probably from Leith or Greenock, if the emigrants <lb/>were in sufficient numbers, and so prompt in their ar<lb break="no"/>rangements, that the vessel lost no time beyond what <lb/>was strictly necessary for taking her full compliment <lb/>aboard. If the ship is detained a month before this is <lb/>got, the owners must, of course, be indemnified for the <lb/>detention by a higher fare. Four stone of oatmeal, <lb/>with a little ham or salt fish for variety, will subsist a <lb/>man or woman on the voyage ; and thus a human be<lb break="no"/>ing can be conveyed over a distance equal to one-sixth <lb/>part of the circumference of the globe, and six times <lb/>longer, we dare say, than the wanderings of Ulysses, at <lb/>the small coast of 45s !</p>
                <p>In an article in May 1832, we pointed out the rapid <lb/>strides with which emigration was advancing ; and <lb/>some Parliamentary papers we have received since, ex<lb break="no"/>hibit new proofs of its extraordinary progress. It <lb/>has, in fact, outstripped the expectations of the most <lb/>sanguine.</p>
                <p>The following table shows the number of person who <lb/>have emigrated in the last eight years to North America, <lb/>the Cape, and Australia :–</p>
                <p>British America. United States. Cape of G. Hope. Australia. Total. <lb/>1825 8,714 5,551 114 485 14,891 <lb/>1826 12,818 7,063 116 903 20,900 <lb/>1827 12, 14,526 114 715 28,003 <lb/>1828 12,084 12,817 135 1,056 26,092 <lb/>1829 13,307 15,678 197 2,916 31,198 <lb/>1830 30,574 24,887 204 1,242 56,907 <lb/>1831 58,067 23,418 11 1,561 83,160 <lb/>1832 66,339 32,872 196 3,733 103,140</p>
                <p>It will be seen from this table how steady the in<lb break="no"/>crease of emigration has been, especially to Canada. <lb/>It must be observed, that a great proportion, probably <lb/>more than a half of those who sailed for the United <lb/>States, were destined for the British colonies, and only <lb/>chose that route as the most eligible, on account of the <lb/>facilities which the Hudson and its associated canals <lb/>present for travelling to the upper province. Canada <lb/>and Nova Scotia must have drawn at least 80,000 set<lb break="no"/>tlers from Britain last year ; and yet, such are the ca<lb break="no"/>pacities of these colonies for absorbing population, that <lb/>the price of labour was not lowered in the least degree ; <lb/>and from the previous arrangements made, it is an<lb break="no"/>nounced that a much larger number of persons could <lb/>have been received without inconvenience ! Sanguine <lb/>as we were upon the subject, we did not anticipate that <lb/>emigration could be conducted on such a scale, with <lb/>the extraordinary ease, certainty, and economy now ex<lb break="no"/>emplified. Those who reflect on the distress and <lb/>perplexity which would be produced by land<lb break="no"/>ing the <hi rend="italic">sixth-part</hi>  of eighty thousand strangers on <lb/>the shores of Britain in one summer, will appreciate <lb/>the extremely dissimilar condition of a colony which, <lb/>with less than a million inhabitants, can take in <lb/>eighty-thousand new settlers in the same period without <lb/>embarassment or confusion.</p>
                <p>The general result is, that Britain sent off 103,000 <lb/>souls from her population last year, of whom a[?] number <lb/>sailed 7000 miles, a number 14,000, and those who <lb/>made the shortest voyage, 4000 miles. The annals of <lb/>emigration afford nothing approaching to this in any <lb/>part of the world ; and yet we may reasonably expect to <lb/>see still greater things atcheived.</p>
                <p>It appears from the various census since 1801, that <lb/>the annual increase in Britain, if no persons left it, <lb/>would be about 350,000; or we may place the fact in <lb/>a more striking light by stating, that <hi rend="italic">there are about a </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">thousand persons more in the three kingdoms every </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">day than there was on the day before</hi>. If by raising <lb/>the habits and ideas of the labouring classes, we could <lb/>get this daily increase reduced one half, and the <lb/>other half could be carried off by emigration–if we <lb/>could by this means keep the supply of labour station<lb break="no"/>ary while capital was increasing, a great improvement <lb/>would be effected in the state of the population. Now <lb/>from what has been stated it appears that the emigrants <lb/>who leave our shores annually amount to nearly one<lb break="no"/>third of the annual excess already ; and in a year or <lb/>two there is every probability that it will amount to <lb/>one-half.</p>
                <p>Of 51,200 emigrants who landed at Quebec and <lb/>Montreal last year, 17,500 went from England, <lb/>28,200 from Ireland, and 5,500 from Scotland. In <lb/>the year 1831, the numbers were, from England 10,300, <lb/>Ireland 34,100, Scotland 5,300.</p>
                <p>Of the emigrants from Scotland last year, 1716 sail<lb break="no"/>ed from Greenock, 1145 from Leith, 638 from Cro<lb break="no"/>marty, 478 from Aberdeen, 439 from Dundee, 231 <lb/>from Alloa, 181 from Islay, 175 from Anna, 160 from <lb/>Glasgow, 112 from Leven, 110 from Campbeltown, <lb/>and numbers under 100 from Stanraer, Peterhead, and <lb/>Irvine.</p>
                <p>Of the emigrants to the United States last year <lb/>15,754 sailed from Liverpool, 5,546 from London <lb/>2,742 from Bristol, 2,613 from Londonderry, and <lb/>1,711 from Greenock.</p>
                <p>Mr Buchanan, the Government agent at Quebec, <lb/>states in his Report, that "the general description of <lb/>emigrants who arrived last year ; many respectable and wealthy fa<lb break="no"/>milies came from all part of the united kingdom ; and <lb/>the extent of property and specie brought into the <lb/>country by them is exceedingly great, fully amounting <lb/>to from t600,000 to t700,000 sterling." About 5000 <lb/>persons were sent out by pecuniary aid from parishes <lb/>or landlords ; and there were 1700 "commuted pen<lb break="no"/>sioners" (military, we believe), many of them men of <lb/>irregular habits, and ill fitted for the situation of set<lb break="no"/>tlers. Of these, about 100 returned to Britain. The <lb/>fear of cholera was a considerable check to emigration. <lb/>It appeared in Quebec on the 8th of June, and the <lb/>persons who arrived after that, suffered much from <lb/>the difficulty of procuring lodgings even for a day ; <lb/>but Mr Buchanan estimates the whole number of emi<lb break="no"/>grants who fell victims to the disease, at no more than</p>
                <p>"The demand for all classes of working people <lb/>(says the Report,) has never been exceeded in the Ca<lb break="no"/>nadas, particularly since the abatement of the cholera, <lb/>and I can assure your Lordship that, during my late <lb/>tour through the districts and settlements of Upper <lb/>Canada, I did not see an industrious emigrant who <lb/>could not meet with emplyment. The number of <lb/>that class arrived this year is not adequate to supply <lb/>the demand created by the more wealthy emigrants. <lb/>This was particularly felt in the Western and London <lb/>districts of the upper province, where the want of la<lb break="no"/>bourers was so great that it was found necessary to en<lb break="no"/>courage a number to come over from Ohio and Pen<lb break="no"/>nsylvania." This was written on the 12th Dec. 1832, <lb/>and the arrival of emigrants closed in October.</p>

            </p>
                <p>The following document has just been issued from the <lb/>Colonial Office:–</p>
                <p>Downing street, April 6, 1834. <lb/>Numerous applicants have been received from per<lb break="no"/>sons desirous of emigrating to New South Wales or Van <lb/>Dieman's Land, who, after stating their inability to de<lb break="no"/>fray the whole charge of their conveyance, solicit aid <lb/>for that purpose, on condition of repaying the same out <lb/>of their earnings in the colony where they propose to <lb/>settle. His Majesty's government has sanctioned the <lb/>appropriate of a limited sum out of the colonial reve<lb break="no"/>nues of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, to <lb/>assist the private funds of such emigrants as may ap<lb break="no"/>pear likely to earn the means of repayig that aid, and <lb/>to become useful settlers. The following are the re<lb break="no"/>gulations under which this induglence will be dispens<lb break="no"/>ed:–</p>
                <p>No advance will be made except to young and mar<lb break="no"/>ried agricultural labourers, who intend taking their <lb/>wives and families with them : and a strict inquiry will <lb/>be instituted into their character and habits of industry, <lb/>before the assistance they solicit will be granted to them.</p>
                <p>No one family will be allowed an advance exceeding <lb/>t20; and it will be useful therefore for parties, who <lb/>may not possess the remainder of the sum requisite for <lb/>defraying the expense of their passage, to apply for as<lb break="no"/>sistance.</p>
                <p>Every person desirous of receiving the proposed ad<lb break="no"/>vance must fill up, and send back to the Under Secre<lb break="no"/>tary of State for the Colonial Department, the return <lb/>hereto annexed. If the information contained in this <lb/>return, and the answers to the inquiries which may be <lb/>addressed to the parties who certify the correctness of <lb/>the return, shall be considered satisfactory, the appli<lb break="no"/>cant will receive notice to that effect. He may then <lb/>proceed to make his agreement with the owners or <lb/>masters of ships proceeding to New South Wales or <lb/>Van Diemen's land, and as soon as any ship-owner <lb/>or master shall notify (in a form which will be provided <lb/>for that purpose) that the emigrant has taken the other <lb/>necessary steps for engaging his passage, and order will <lb/>be granted for the payment in the colony, of t20 to the <lb/>agent or master of the vessel in which this emigrant <lb/>may arrive. The emigrant will of course be able to[?] ob-[?] <lb/>tain a corresponding deduction from the amount[?] [?] <lb/>paid by himself in this country.</p>
                <p>The order for payment will be entrusted [?] <lb/>ter of the vessel in which the emigrants to pro[?] <lb/>and will consist of a sealed dispatch to the governor, <lb/>containing the name and description of the party on <lb/>whose account the money is to be paid, and encolosing a <lb/>promissory note, which he will be required to sign in <lb/>acknowledgement of his debt ; which note must be wit<lb break="no"/>nessed by the captain and chief mate of the vessel. But <lb/>arrangements will be made, by which the payment of <lb/>this order will not take place in the colony until the <lb/>captain shall have produced the parties, on whose ac<lb break="no"/>count it is to be made, before the officer appointed for <lb/>that purpose, and they shall have entered into a fresh <lb/>obligation for the repayment of the advance made to <lb/>them. For it is the intention of his Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and cannot be too clearly understoof by all per<lb break="no"/>sons who may accept this loan, that repayments of the <lb/>debt (in such proportions and at such intervals as may <lb/>not be unsuitable to the circumstances of each emi<lb break="no"/>grant) shall be strictly enforced, by means of the ample <lb/>powers which the laws of the colony render available <lb/>for that purpose.</p>
                <p>Government agents for emigration have been appoint<lb break="no"/>ed at Liverpool, Bristol, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Bel<lb break="no"/>fast, and Greenock, who have been instructed to afford <lb/>gratuitous information to all persons applying to them <lb/>as to the best means of carrying their schemes of emi<lb break="no"/>gration into effect. Parties, therefore, who may reside <lb/>in the neighbourhood of these agents are requested to <lb/>apply to them either personally (or if by letter post <lb/>paid) for information on this subject.</p>
                <p>All application for the assistance of government must <lb/>be made by letter only, addressed to R. W. Hay, Esq. <lb/>Under Secretary of State, London ; and should the <lb/>number of applications be greater than the funds at <lb/>their disposal will enable them to comply with, priority <lb/>of date will form the rule of selection among applications <lb/>in which there shall appear no other groun of distinc<lb break="no"/>tion. <hi rend="smallcaps">W. R. Hay.</hi>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Association.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>A meeting of the members of the South Australian Asso<lb break="no"/>ciation was held on Monday, at Exeter Hall, "for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of explaining the principles, objects, plan, and prospects <lb/>of a new colony," proposed to be founded in South Australia. <lb/>Mr W. Whitmore in the chair.</p>
                <p>Upon taking the chair, Mr Whitmore stated, that the first <lb/>question which the meeting would have to consider would be <lb/>this–whether there existed or not at present any necessity <lb/>for a more extended system of colonization. It appeared to <lb/>him that there was a great defect in our present system of <lb/>colonication, and that it would be greatly to our advantage if <lb/>we established it upon a new principle, well and seriously <lb/>considered. That which struck him as the greatest defect <lb/>was, that we did not provided that colonization which in<lb break="no"/>cluded within it members of all classes of society. Large <lb/>numbers of emigrants went out with capital, but not carry<lb break="no"/>ing with them that number of the lower class which was <lb/>necessary to employ their capital to advantage. In other <lb/>cases, perhaps almost as numerous, the labourer went out <lb/>without capital which was necessry to enable him to employ <lb/>his labour to advantage. This was a striking defect. Now <lb/>the question which they were then called upon to consider, <lb/>regarded the best means of remedying that defect. Those <lb/>means, it appeared to him, were quite practicable, and might <lb/>be accomplished in this manner, vz. by establishing as a sys<lb break="no"/>tem that all the waste lands which they were about to colo<lb break="no"/>nize should be sold at a given price, such as the market would <lb/>command, and that the proceeds of such sales should be <lb/>employed in sending out to the colonies a sufficient number <lb/>of labourers to cultivate the lands so sold. If this system <lb/>could be carried into effect, he apprehended that all the evils <lb/>of our present system of colonization would be removed, and <lb/>that we should be enabled to transplant a portion of the com<lb break="no"/>munity of the mother country with all its various grades into <lb/>the new country which they now proposed to coloniz. He <lb/>believed that if we proceeded upon this principle, we should <lb/>lay the foundation of the greatest colony which England had <lb/>ever settled.</p>
                <p>Mr Grote, M.P., moved the first resolution,–"That the <lb/>wealth and prosperity of this country have been greatly pro<lb break="no"/>moted by the establishment of British colonies in various <lb/>parts of the world, and that colonization, when conducted <lb/>systematically and upon sound principles, offers the means of <lb/>extending indefinitely the commercial empire of the united <lb/>kingdom, and the field of employment for British capital and <lb/>labour." He would not enter into the recommendations <lb/>which this undertaking offered to all classes of the communi<lb break="no"/>ty ; but he would venture to state, that to any gentleman <lb/>who considered the prospectus which had been put out by the <lb/>association, and who recollected that it was a matter of cer<lb break="no"/>tainty that the land in the colony was to be used as the means <lb/>of raising a fund to carry over thither the labour, which was <lb/>superabundant here, it must be evident that from this impor<lb break="no"/>tant innovation on our colonial system great benefit must be <lb/>derived[?] both to the new colony and to the mother country.</p>
                <p>Mr Clay, M.P., in seocnding the resolution, entered at <lb/>great length into the difficulty of finding employment, which <lb/>now prevails in all parts of the community, and then, after <lb/>condemning the corn laws, continued thus–Colonization, if <lb/>carried on to a considerable extent, would as effectually add <lb/>millions of fertile acres to our shores as if the Irish sea were <lb/>filled up with fertile land. If that miracle took place is it <lb/>not clear that all distress would immediately cease, and that <lb/>the emplyment which the addition of so many fertile acres <lb/>would afford must give a new stimulus to the prosperity of <lb/>the country ? Is it not clear that the miserable compotation[?] <lb/>for potato-gardens in Ireland would cease, and that the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties flowing from an unemployed population would cease ? <lb/>Does any man doubt that it would be well worth the while of <lb/>our capitalists to take such land at from 10s to 20s an acre. <lb/>(Hear.) Yet this plan is in effect the same as if the land were <lb/>added to our own island, because, if this plan of colonization <lb/>be adopted, a transplantation of a sufficiency of labourers, <lb/>now wanting employment, from this country, for its culture, <lb/>will take place, which is equivalent to the transportation of <lb/>the land to the labourer. In point of fact, the ocean joins <lb/>these distant lands, instead of separating them. (Hear.)– <lb/>There can be no doubt but that a wider comercial code, and <lb/>the removal of restrictions on labour, would greatly facilitate, <lb/>extend, and increase the commercial intercourse between the <lb/>old nation of the world ; but in no case would the increase <lb/>be in proportion to that which might be calculated on, as the <lb/>consequence of a connection with newly-formed countries in <lb/>other climates. As regards the establishment of colonies, it <lb/>is virtually an extension of the mother country.</p>
                <p>Colonel Torrens, M.P., proposed the second resolution– <lb/>"That in establishing colonies, great care ought to be taken <lb/>to combine labour and capital with land, in such propor<lb break="no"/>tions as are best calculated to insure the prosperity of all <lb/>classes of society, and that, in establishing modern colonies, <lb/>this important consideration has been so generally overlook<lb break="no"/>ed." It was, he said, almost unnecessary for him to state that <lb/>in all systems of colonization, land, labour, and capital, ought <lb/>to be combinedin just proportions ; and yet this simple prin<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ciple had been hitherto greatly neglected by those who had <lb/>led new colonies from the mother country. In the first place, <lb/>the whole of the land of this colony was to be public land. <lb/>No individual was to obtain a single acre by gift. There was <lb/>to be no patronage, no job–all were to be on a footing of <lb/>equality, and nobody was to have a single inch of land for <lb/>nothing. There would also be another advantage in this sys<lb break="no"/>tem, which would arise in the following :–In other co<lb break="no"/>lonies, the labourer who had gone out and found that he could <lb/>get land for nothing, had often fallen into the mistake that <lb/>land was wealth, instead of it being merely the means of <lb/>producing wealth. That fatal mistake had often led him to <lb/>refuse the work of the master with whom he had gone out, <lb/>and set up for himself as an independent landowner. He had <lb/>in consequence set up, where he was far away from the mar<lb break="no"/>ket of the colony, where he had no roads over which to convey <lb/>his produce, and where he had perished miserably. But in <lb/>this colony the labourers would be compelled for some time <lb/>to work for hire.</p>
                <p>Mr Guest, M.P. seconded the resolution.</p>
                <p>Mr Hutt, M.P. moved the third resolution to the following <lb/>effect:–"That in order to promote the greatest prosperity of <lb/>a new colony, it is expedient that all waste land, without any <lb/>exception, shall be declared public land, and be disposed of to <lb/>individuals by sale only, and according to an uniform, impar<lb break="no"/>tial, and permanent system."</p>
                <p>Captain Gowan seconded the resolution, and spoke in the <lb/>highest terms of the salubrity of the climate of Australia. <lb/>Many of his fellow soldiers in India had gone there for the <lb/>recovery of their health, and had found something so tem<lb break="no"/>perate and soothing in the country, that they had retired <lb/>there altogeher, preferring its mild and gentle breeze to the <lb/>chills of their native country, England.</p>
                <p>Mr P. Scrope, M.P. moved "That it is also desirable that <lb/>the whole of the purchase money of public land, without any <lb/>deduction, should be employed in providing a free passage <lb/>from the mother country to the colony, of young adult per<lb break="no"/>sons of the labouring class, who may be willing to emigrate, <lb/>and in equal proportion of both sexes." As the want of <lb/>labour was the great difficulty in all infant colonies, the <lb/>more labour they imported, the greater labour did they give <lb/>their land ; the more they got for the sale of it, the greater <lb/>was their power of importing fresh labour. This resolution, <lb/>therefore, acted in a reciprocal manner upon itself, and when <lb/>it was once fairly put into operation they would proceed on<lb break="no"/>wards on the road to prosperity with accelerated velocity, <lb/>meeting with no other obstacle than the unwillingness of <lb/>England to part with her inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Mr Wilks, M.P. seconded the resolution.</p>
                <p>Mr Handson moved –"That amongst the unoccupied por<lb break="no"/>tions of the earth which form part of the British dominions, <lb/>the south coast of Australia appears to be a sport peculiarly <lb/>suitable for founding a colony upon the principles embodied <lb/>in the preceding resolutions." The place where this colony <lb/>was to be founded was one distinguished from every other <lb/>part of Australia, from its possessing a facility of internal <lb/>communications prior even to the formation of roads, and <lb/>the soil would amply repay the labour expended on its culti<lb break="no"/>vation.</p>
                <p>Mr Robert Owen (not of Lanark) said that the coasts of <lb/>this colony abounded with whales, and that its whale fishe<lb break="no"/>ries might become valuable.</p>
                <p>Mr M. D. Hill rose to propose the resolution embodying the <lb/>mode of carrying the principles of this association into effect. <lb/>No colony could go on without some law. He did not care <lb/>how little they had of it, provided they made up in quality <lb/>what was deficient in quantity. The hon. member entered <lb/>into an elaborate description of the laws intended to be enact<lb break="no"/>ed for the colony, and concluded by moving–"That the <lb/>provisions for the peace, order, and good government of the <lb/>British Province of South Australia, as contained in the bill <lb/>now before Parliament, are highly satisfactory."</p>
                <p>Mr D. Wakefield seconded the resolution.</p>
                <p>Sir W. Molesworth, M.P. proposed, and Mr Childers, M.P., <lb/>seconded the following resolution :–"That it is the opinion <lb/>of this meeting that the thanks of the country are due to Mr <lb/>Spring Rice for his prompt and enlightened conduct in pro<lb break="no"/>moting the beneficial public object of the South Australian <lb/>Association."</p>
                <p>The resolutions were carried unanimously. Thanks were <lb/>given to the Chairman, and the meeting, at which many <lb/>ladies were present, broke up. The proceedings lasted from <lb/>twelve o'clock to a quarter before five.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Affairs of Oude</hi>
            </p>
                <p>On the order of the day for the third reading of the Univer<lb break="no"/>sities' Admission bill being moved–</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Herriks[?]</hi>  took the occasion of calling on Government to <lb/>explain the circumstances which had occurred in certain <lb/>transactions between the Board of Controul and the East India <lb/>directors. These transactions, the hon. gentleman stated, to <lb/>be the repeated peremptory commands of the Board of Con<lb break="no"/>troul to the Directors of the East India Company to prepare <lb/>a despatch for the purpose of directing the Indian Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to compel the King of Oude, to pay certain claims made <lb/>on him on behalf of Calcutta bankers, which commands the <lb/>Court of Directors refused to obey, on the ground that the in<lb break="no"/>terference which the Board of Controul required them to ex<lb break="no"/>ercise with the King of Oude, was inconsistent with the re<lb break="no"/>lations subsisting between the British Government and the <lb/>King of Oude, and would be most mischievous in effect. On <lb/>the 31st of January the right jon. gentleman had appliedfor, <lb/>and obtained a rule to show cause why, under the act of Par<lb break="no"/>liament, a <hi rend="italic">mandamus</hi>  should not issue to compel the Court <lb/>of Directors to comply with the desire ofthe Board of Con<lb break="no"/>troul. On the 31st of January, 1834, the Court of King's <lb/>bench was prepared to give its decision upon the application <lb/>for the <hi rend="italic">mandamus</hi>, when, without any reason being assigned, <lb/>the right hon. President of the Board of Controul withdrew <lb/>his application.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">C. Grant</hi>  said that in the regret which had been express<lb break="no"/>ed respecting the possible collision between the two authorities, <lb/>he fully concurred; bu, entertaining such a sentiment, he <lb/>confessed it surprised him not a little to find his Right Hon. <lb/>Friend endeavouring to open a dispute already composed. <lb/>The right honourable gentleman then proceeded to give <lb/>a brief outline of the case, and referred to the various high <lb/>authorities connected with India, who had declared in favour <lb/>of the demand. With regard to his having withdrawn the ap<lb break="no"/>plication for the <hi rend="italic">mandamus</hi>  without explanation, he had to <lb/>say that he fully explain his opinions to the Directors, <lb/>he had re-stated them verbally to the chairman, and he did <lb/>not think himself required, under the circumstances, to re<lb break="no"/>enter into a long discussion upon the point. The effect of the <lb/>recommendation to the King of Oude was merely to urge the <lb/>claim upon his attention.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">R. Peel</hi>  said it was a perfectly novel doctrine, and in the <lb/>present state of the world most inconvenient, that the non<lb break="no"/>payment of debts due to his subjects should give the King of <lb/>England a right forcibly to intervene with foreign states, ex<lb break="no"/>cept where sanctioned by positive treaty.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Hume</hi>  contended, that on the whole, the debt was a just <lb/>one, and ought to be paid.</p>
                <p>The subject here dropped.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Admission of Dissenters to the Universities.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>On the question that this bill be read a third time,</p>
                <p>Mr T. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gladstone</hi>  rose to oppose it. It would, he said, be <lb/>useless to pass the bill, for it would of necessity be inopera<lb break="no"/>tive. If he were asked why he opposed a bill which, if pass<lb break="no"/>ed, would be inoperative, his answer was that he objected <lb/>to its principle, the admission of which was equally destruc<lb break="no"/>tive, whether it effected the object of its promoters or not. <lb/>Further, they were bound to respect corporate rights as long <lb/>as the intentions of their founders were fulfilled ; and no one <lb/>could deny that the Universities did fulfilthe intentions of <lb/>their founders." (Hear, hear.)</p>
                <p>Mr V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Smith</hi>  supported the bill, as one calculated to take <lb/>away a reproach from the Establishment, and be felt as a <lb/>compliment by the Dissenters, whose only desire was to exer<lb break="no"/>cise their vigorous intellects in the promotion of science <lb/>and literature.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Baines</hi>  said, that the original statutes showed that there <lb/>were then no tests, nor did any exist at Oxford, in either the <lb/>time of the Lollards or of Wickliff. The term University had <lb/>in it an argument for thegeneral use of these seats of learn<lb break="no"/>ing, which were meant to be universal, both as to the sub<lb break="no"/>jects taught, and the persons to whom they were communi<lb break="no"/>cated. In this sense, the term was understood and applied in <lb/>other countries, and it was an extraordinary fact, deserving <lb/>of attention, that the Universities of Oxford and of Cambridge <lb/>were the only universities that were closed to a large pro<lb break="no"/>portion of the upper classes of the people in any country in <lb/>Europe. This the Dissenters of England felt as a grievous <lb/>indignity, and they thought it unjust that Englishmen should <lb/>attempt to degrade Englishmen by excluding them from the <lb/>best seats of literature and science.</p>
                <p>Mr H. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hughes</hi>  could not accede to the measure, and there<lb break="no"/>fore moved that it be read that day six months.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Goulburn</hi>  contended that the introduction of the Dis<lb break="no"/>senters, as proposed under the present bill, would be nothing <lb/>short of the destruction of the present system of education at <lb/>the Universities. It was indisputable that at a University, re<lb break="no"/>ligion could only be taught according to some set form : <lb/>abandon that mode of tuition, and you abandon the religion <lb/>itself. (Cries of "No, no.") If they let in Dissenters, it was <lb/>perfectly obvious the intentions of the founders of those es<lb break="no"/>tablishments would be completely defeated : he therefore de<lb break="no"/>precated the measures as injurious to religon and opposed to <lb/>the best interest of the country.</p>
                <p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerstone</hi>, Sir R. <hi rend="smallcaps">Inglis</hi>, and Mr G. <hi rend="smallcaps">Wood</hi>  then <lb/>addressed the house, but amidst such discordant noises as <lb/>prevented what they said being heard. The laughing, jeer<lb break="no"/>ing, shouting, were such as has seldom been heard. In par<lb break="no"/>ticular two hon. members who entered from the smoking <lb/>room into the opposite gallery during the address of Mr <lb/>Wood, and who stretched themselves at full length on the <lb/>seats secure from the observation of the Speaker, kept up a <lb/>row of the most discreditable character. The Speaker, with <lb/>much indignation in his tone and manner, called the parties <lb/>to order.</p>
                <p>The motion for the third reading was carried, on a division, <lb/>by 164 to 25. <cb/>The Trading Companies Bill, the Arms Importation (Ire<lb break="no"/>land) Bill, and the Court of Chancery (Ireland) Bill, went <lb/>through committees.</p>
                <p>The Four Courts (Dublin) Bill, the Weights and Measures <lb/>Bill, and the Turnpike Acts Amendment Bill, were read a <lb/>third time and passed.</p>
                <p>The Almanack Stamps Repeal Bill, the Assessed Taxes <lb/>Repeal Bill, and the Militia Ballot Suspension Bill, were <lb/>brought in, and read a first time.</p>
                <p>The house was counted out at three o'clock in the morning.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Tuesday, July 29.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">John Cam Hobhouse</hi>  and General Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward Barnes</hi>, <lb/>took the oaths and their seats ; the former for Nottingham, in <lb/>the room of Lord Duncannon, raised to the Peerage ; the <lb/>latter for Sudbury, in the room of M. A. Taylor, Esq. deceased.</p>
                <p>On the motion of Mr Alderman <hi rend="smallcaps">Thompson</hi>  the Durham and <lb/>Sunderland Railway bill was read a third time and passed.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Southern Australia</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Mr S. <hi rend="smallcaps">Rice</hi>  moved the order of the day for the house <lb/>to resolve into Committee upon the Bill for the Colonization <lb/>of Southern Australia,</p>
                <p>Mr A. <hi rend="smallcaps">Baring</hi>  rose and stated various objections to the pro<lb break="no"/>ject. The hon. member contended that at this period of the <lb/>year there was not time to deliberate upon such an important <lb/>subject, and, independent of this preliminary objection, he <lb/>said he did not conceive that government ought to sanction <lb/>any such experiment without a full conviction that there was <lb/>a reasonable probability of its success. In his opinion the <lb/>experiment was founded upon bases more mistaken than any <lb/>similar one which had ever been tried. In fact, according to <lb/>the plan which had been laid down, the colony would be tied <lb/>up by mortgages in such a way, that it would not again re<lb break="no"/>vert to the Crown, so that the territory would be lost. The <lb/>result would be, that if the gentlemen who set the project on <lb/>foot were mistaken–as he was sure they had been–we would <lb/>be prevented from touching this large portion of Australia, <lb/>unless we could pay off the debt which had been contracted. <lb/>While he stated these objections to the plan, he was anxious <lb/>not to be understood to be inimical to colonization, for <lb/>he was very favourable to it. Every new opening to co<lb break="no"/>lonization he was convinced was a substantial benefit to the <lb/>poorer classes, (Hear, hear, hear.) It was not, therefore, <lb/>to the principle of colonization that he was opposed, <lb/>but he objected to this bill becaue the plan was a most <lb/>mistaken one, and would eventually shut up this large <lb/>portion of the world. One of his main objections was to the <lb/>extent to which it was proposed to carry the experiment. Let <lb/>the gentlemen take, if they like, 100 square miles, but let <lb/>them not risk the whole of a great continent. People, like <lb/>fuel, he said, could not well be carried too far ; they might <lb/>get a few thousands to go out, but they would never get the <lb/>tens of thousands to go which were required for the success of <lb/>the project. The hon. member then objected to two of the <lb/>principles which were laid down by the projectors, that land <lb/>should not be sold lower than 12s. per acre, and that no credit <lb/>should be given. He was convinced that any man acquainted <lb/>with the practical workings of the system in other colonies, <lb/>would blow up the whole plan in a moment. No man who <lb/>went out to Australia would think of taking less than two <lb/>hundred acres. Now that would cost him t120; it would <lb/>cost him t120 more to get himself and his family over; which, <lb/>with stock and other expenses, would amount to t500 or t600. <lb/>He would, therefore, ask any gentlemen in that house, whe<lb break="no"/>ther they thought any man who had t500 or t600 in this <lb/>country, would go out and set himself down on two hundred <lb/>acres in Australia. (Hear, hear.) He therefore suggested to <lb/>his right hon. friend to consent that the committee be post<lb break="no"/>poned until another session, and then have it referred to a <lb/>select committee. He concluded by moving, as an amend<lb break="no"/>ment, that the bill be committed on that day six months.</p>
                <p>Mr W. <hi rend="smallcaps">Whitmore</hi>  was thakful for the very candid manner <lb/>in which the hon. member had stated his objections to the bill. <lb/>With respect to the large extent of territory, he (Mr W.) <lb/>thought that was necessary, as it was intended to introduce a <lb/>completely new system of colonization–one very different from <lb/>any thing ever before attempted. The extent of land it was <lb/>intended to take under this act was from 500,000 to 600,000 <lb/>square miles, and it was the leading principle of the bill that <lb/>all the money arising from the sale of lands should be applied <lb/>to the purpose of sending out labourers free of expense.– <lb/>(Hear, hear, hear.) If this plan succeeded, there would be a <lb/>constant stream of emigrants going out. The land sold by the <lb/>Canada Company had been at a higher price. He had san<lb break="no"/>guine hopes that all the money it would be necessary to <lb/>borrow would be easily repaid. He most conscientously con<lb break="no"/>sidered that this bill would prove a very great benefit to the <lb/>country. It would tend exceedingly towards facilitating and <lb/>amending the conditions of the people of England and Ireland, <lb/>and therefore he hoped it would pass.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">O'Dwyer</hi>  contended that, before the house thought of <lb/>agreeing to such a bill as this, they ought to do something <lb/>towards the ameloriation of the condition of the people of <lb/>Ireland. The various reports which committees of that house <lb/>had made, showed that one-fourth of the land of that country <lb/>was untilled, but was at the same time what was called re<lb break="no"/>claimable land, and well calculated for the cultivation and <lb/>produce of grain. Let this country advance some of the sur<lb break="no"/>plus capital talked of by the hon. member towards the culti<lb break="no"/>vation of this bog land, and discontent would flee[?] from Ire<lb break="no"/>land entirely. The Irish people wanted employment, give <lb/>them that and the house would hear no more about murders, <lb/>fires, and other outrages.</p>
                <p>Mr S. <hi rend="smallcaps">Rice</hi>  in reference to the allusion made by the hon. <lb/>and learned member, begged to say that, although much of <lb/>the bog land in question belonged to private individuals, yet a <lb/>portion of it was the property of the Government, who had <lb/>been, and still were, making experiments, with a view to as<lb break="no"/>certain if the views of the Commissioners could be carried into <lb/>effect. With respect to the manner in which the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Essex had opened this question, he must confess that <lb/>he had brought with him much of usefulness and of experi<lb break="no"/>ence, and of such a character, too, as could not fail to carry <lb/>weight. The right hon. gentleman then proceeded to speak <lb/>in favour of the proposed colonization of South Australia</p>
                <p>After some farther discussion, strangers were ordered to <lb/>withdraw, and the house divided, when there appeared–For <lb/>going into committee, 72; against it 7–Majority, 65.</p>
                <p>The bill went through the committee. The report was re<lb break="no"/>ceived, and ordered to be taken into further consideration on <lb/>Thursday next.</p>
                <p>Several petitions were presented, and, at three o'clock, the <lb/>Speaker left the chair.</p>

Napier has been appointed Governor <lb/>of the embryo colony in South Australia, and we be<lb break="no"/>lieve that a fitter appointment could not have been <lb/>made. We only regret that Colonel Napier has not <lb/>been sent to superintend a colony founded on some<lb break="no"/>thing like sane principles. But if this Austra<lb break="no"/>lian project end, as we have little doubt it will do, <lb/>in the ruin of those who are weak and silly enough to <lb/>embark in it, no one will ascribe any part of the fail<lb break="no"/>ure to the incapacity or unfitness of the Governor. <lb/>The whole blame will fall on the contrivers of the <lb/>scheme.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">South Australia.</hi> –The act of Parliament for found<lb break="no"/>ing this colony will now come into full operation ; the <lb/>Commissioners having complied with the conditions <lb/>precedent, by the sale of t35,000 worth of land, and <lb/>by raisingthe required loan for the government of the <lb/>colony. We may therefore expect shortly to see the <lb/>names of the various officers gazetted (some of them <lb/>have been long ago nominated) ; and we understand <lb/>that active preparations are making with a view to the <lb/>immediate departure of the officers and a small body <lb/>of emigrants. This first expedition will be placed un<lb break="no"/>der the command of Captain Hindmarsh, R.N., the <lb/>Governor ; who, with the assistance of the Surveyors <lb/>and other qualified persons, will carefully examine the <lb/>various harbours in the colony, the quality of the <lb/>neighbouring soil, the supply of water, &amp;c. ; and will <lb/>select that site which, all things considered, is most <lb/>desirable for the first town. We believe it is the in<lb break="no"/>tention of the Commissions not to send out the main <lb/>body of emigrants until the next spring, so as to allow <lb/>ample time for the necessary preparations for their re<lb break="no"/>ception.– <hi rend="italic">Spectator.</hi>

                <p>There have been 300 convents suppressed within <lb/>the last three years. The example was set by the <lb/>Emperor of Russia, who, was by an ukase, dated 31st <lb/>July 1832, abolished 187 convents of monks. This <lb/>was followed by the King of Prussia, who, by a royal <lb/>order, secularised all the convents in the Duchy of <lb/>Posen. In 1834, Don Pedro put down 300 convents, <lb/>and Spain has lately abolished 1800.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration.</hi> –It will be observed, from an adver<lb break="no"/>tisement in to-day's paper, that Government are fitting <lb/>another ship for the <hi rend="italic">free</hi>  conveyance of single females <lb/>from London to Van Dieman's Land ; and from the <lb/>great demand for agricultural labourers, and mecha<lb break="no"/>nics of every description, in that colony, it has been <lb/>resolved to grant a passage to that class, at a cost not <lb/>above what is paid to America–Government paying <lb/>the remainder of the sum as a bounty, amounting to <lb/>t30, which may certainly be looked upon as a great <lb/>boon, both by individuals and the colony at large. In <lb/>all the colonies there appears to be a scarcity of work<lb break="no"/>ing people, as from an official document in our posses<lb break="no"/>sion, it is asserted, on authority, that in Upper Canada <lb/>agricultural labourers, domestic servants, and trades<lb break="no"/>men of every description, will be for some years in <lb/>great request. Farm labourers readily obtain from <lb/>t25 to t30 per annum, with board, lodging, and <lb/>washing, and day-labourers from 3s. to 4s. per day, <lb/>with provisions. The government agent for emigra<lb break="no"/>tion for the Canadas asserts he could find imme<lb break="no"/>diate employment for 20,000 working people, as pub<lb break="no"/>lic improvements are much retarded for want of hands. <lb/>As this is the best season, we would advise all those <lb/>intending to emigrate to apply to the government <lb/>agent for emigration at the Custom House, Leith, <lb/>who will give gratuitous information regarding the <lb/>colonies, and advise as to the best method of putting <lb/>their plans into execution. The rate of wages for <lb/>every description of mechanics may be likewise seen <lb/>there.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Australian Colonies</hi>.–We have seen a print<lb break="no"/>ed circular containing extracts of a letter from Mr <lb/>John Sullivan, surgeon-superintendent of the Emi<lb break="no"/>grant ship <hi rend="italic">Canton</hi>, dated Sydney, 6th October 1835, <lb/>addressed to Edward Forster, Esq. chairman of the <lb/>Emigration Committee, London. In this letter Mr <lb/>Sullivan mentions that the female emigrants, on land<lb break="no"/>ing, were placed in spacious and commodious build<lb break="no"/>ings, adjoining the Government House, at Syd<lb break="no"/>ney, where every attention was paid to their com<lb break="no"/>fort and security from improper intrusion. The <lb/>writer further states :–" We landed in Sydney a <lb/>greater proportion of well conducted, industrious, and <lb/>virtuous young women, than were ever before landed <lb/>from any of the ships of the Emigration Committee <lb/>that came to these Colonies. Three-fourths of the <lb/>young women were engaged, and went into comfort<lb break="no"/>able situations, on the first and second days after land<lb break="no"/>ing ; and before a week all the useful and good ser<lb break="no"/>vants, viz. laundresses, cooks, servants of all work, <lb/>dairymaids, and housekeepers, were in places, many <lb/>of them in Syndey and the surroundings districts ; se<lb break="no"/>veral were taken up the country to Maitland and <lb/>Bathurst ; and as many more cooks, laundresses, dairy<lb break="no"/>maids, or farm servants as we had, could obtain places <lb/>in that time, for these are the descriptions of female <lb/>servants in demand throughout the colony. The <lb/>wages varied from t8 to t20. Some, who were not <lb/>very good servants of all work and housemaids, got <lb/>t8 to t10 ; cooks and laundresses, t12 to t16 (the <lb/>latter are much wanted) ; housemaids and needlewo<lb break="no"/>men, t10 to t12 ; housekeepers, t16 to t20. Go<lb break="no"/>vernesses also are much sought for it ; if we had had <lb/>twenty qualified they could have got situations in <lb/>respectable families and schools ; but the salaries to <lb/>this class are small, say t25 to t40. Nursery gover<lb break="no"/>nesses got t20. All the male emigrants who under<lb break="no"/>stood agriculture, or the management of stock in ge<lb break="no"/>neral, but particularly sheep, were engaged imme<lb break="no"/>diately, at salaries varying from t40 to t50, with a <lb/>house and rations for family use." We understand <lb/>that the <hi rend="italic">Canton</hi>  had a number of females from Edin<lb break="no"/>burgh and its neighbourhood, and the above informa<lb break="no"/>tion must be highly satisafactory to their relatives.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir George Clerk.</hi> –As the cawing of the rooks <lb/>portends a storm, it is worth while to mention that <lb/>the cunning baronet has come down from London, <lb/>and commenced a canvass in this county within these <lb/>few days. It is stated, we believe upon good autho<lb break="no"/>rity, that he accounts for this course of proceeding, <lb/>by referring to the great probability of the Lords <lb/>throwing out the Irish Municipal Bill.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Burn's Monument.</hi> –We understand that there <lb/>is now an early prospect of the completion of this <lb/>monument, which has too long remained in an un<lb break="no"/>finished state, to the surprise of strangers, and the <lb/>discredit to our Modern Athens. The sum already <lb/>in the Treasurer's hands, aided by the profits of the <lb/>handsome musical work lately issued by Mr M'Leod, <lb/>which he has generously devoted to that purpose, is <lb/>now nearly sufficient to meet the calculations of the <lb/>expense requird for the railing in and decoration of <lb/>the ground around the monument. We expect, there<lb break="no"/>fore, that the work will forthwith be commenced, and <lb/>if a few pounds are still wanted, we have no doubt <lb/>there are hundreds in Edinburgh who would wil<lb break="no"/>lingly guarantee the Treasurer against any loss by <lb/>the immediate completion of the undertaking.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Presentation of Plate.</hi> –Mr A. S. Walker, late of <lb/>the Commercial Bank of Scotland, at present manager <lb/>of the branch of the Commercial Bank of England, <lb/>at Uttoxeter, in Staffordshire, was lately presented <lb/>with an elegant tea service by the proprietors of that <lb/>establishment, bearing the following inscription :– <lb/>"Presented to Mr Archibald S. Walker, by the <lb/>Uttoxeter Proprietors of the Commercial Bank of <lb/>England, as a small acknowledgement of his faithful <lb/>and valuable services–March, 1836." This is ano<lb break="no"/>ther proof of the estimation in which many of the <lb/>young men are held who have been trained to the <lb/>banking system in this country. <cb/>From a Return, just published, we find that the <lb/>emigration to Canada has been comparatively small <lb/>last year. The whole number of emigrants landed at <lb/>Quebec and Montreal in 1835, was 12,527 : in 1831 <lb/>and 1832 four times, and in 1834 two times as many <lb/>were sent out. Of the 12,527, there were 5597 adult <lb/>males, 3866 females, and 3064 children under 14 <lb/>years. Of the whole number, 1043 were sent out by <lb/>parochial aid. The numbers from the three king<lb break="no"/>doms were– <lb/>England, 3067 <lb/>Ireland, 7,108 <lb/>Scotland, 2,127 <lb/>From Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, &amp;c. 225 <lb/>Settled in Lower Canada, 2,297 <lb/>Upper Canada, 9,800 <lb/>Died at Grosse Isle and Quebec, 13 <lb/>Returned to the United Kingdom, 117 <lb/>Removed to the United States, 300 <lb/>–12,527</p>
                <p>But besides those who went to Canada, 16,749 <lb/>landed at New York, raising the whole number of <lb/>emigrants to 29,376. There were no less than three <lb/>vessels wrecked last year on their way to Quebec– <lb/>the William Ewing from Londonderry with 300 pas<lb break="no"/>sengers, all saved–the barque James from Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, all saved–and the Nathaniel Graham from <lb/>Cork, with 48 persons on board, passengers and crew, <lb/>of whom 41 were lost.</p>
                <p>From another part of the Report, we find that 2764 <lb/>female emigrants were sent out to Australia last year, <lb/>under the superintendence of the Emigration Com<lb break="no"/>mittee. Of these 2105 had a free passage. The ar<lb break="no"/>rangements seem to have been ood ; for the mortality <lb/>was small, and few complaints were made. The fe<lb break="no"/>males were all of decent character, and due care was <lb/>taken on their arrival to get them disposed of as ser<lb break="no"/>vants, in situations where their morals would not be <lb/>exposed to unnecessary risk.</p>

The number of <lb/>passengers expected is 450,000; the expected income <lb/>is t93,000, of which t67,800 is from passengers ; <lb/>the estimated expense of the work is t539,000.

No one <lb/>can have travelled over the ground without observing <lb/>how admirably it is fitted for this species of commu<lb break="no"/>nication, by its remarkable uniformity of surface. We <lb/>should have doubted whether such a work would pay, <lb/>had it terminated at Edinburgh ; but as a part of an <lb/>unbroken line reaching across the most fertile and <lb/>populous parts of Scotland, from the German ocean <lb/>to the Atlantic, its chances of success are vastly in<lb break="no"/>creased.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Dundee and Arbroath Railway.</hi> –The Com<lb break="no"/>mittee's report on this railway has reached us, but we <lb/>must confine ourselves to an abstract. The length <lb/>is 16 miles 5 furlongs and 90 yards ; the capital <lb/>t100,000, divided into 4000 shares, which is all sub<lb break="no"/>scribed, but authority is taken to raise t40,000 more <lb/>by loan ; sum paid up t5000 ; subscribed by share<lb break="no"/>holders locally interested t88,900, by others t7150 : <lb/>there are three subscribers for t2000 and upwards : <lb/>the expected income from passengers is t16,912, <lb/>goods t14,654, from both t31,566. There are no <lb/>tunnels, no inclined planes, and the steepest gradient <lb/>being only 1 in 1000, scarcely differs from a dead <lb/>level. It does not cross any highway or turnpike on a <lb/>level. The estimated expenses is t99,844.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Statute Labour Acts.</hi> –It appears from the <lb/>votes of the House of Commons, that a Select Com<lb break="no"/>mittee has been appointed to investigate the Scottish <lb/>Statute Labour Acts, and to consider what amend<lb break="no"/>ments may be made thereon. It may be stated, that <lb/>by the present act for this county, proprietors of land, <lb/>and several other descriptions of people are totally <lb/>exempted from any burden, on account of the coaches, <lb/>chaises, gigs, or saddle horses they may keep, though <lb/>it is quite plain good roads are of as much advantage <lb/>to them as to the occupiers of land, upon whom almost <lb/>the sole burden is thrown. In many parishes a con<lb break="no"/>siderable addition would be made to the road funds, <lb/>were no such exemptions allowed. At present the <lb/>management is vested in heritors, rated at one hun<lb break="no"/>dred pounds Scots and upwards, though it is stated <lb/>with confidence, that were the occupiers of land in<lb break="no"/>cluded, beneficial consequences would follow.– <hi rend="italic">East- </hi>

A very satisfactory report for the last year was <lb/>read, and thanks were voted to the different Office<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>bearers. It appears that this society was established <lb/>under the countenance of the Magistrates and Minis<lb break="no"/>ters, and various influential individuals in Leith, and <lb/>is well deserving of encouragement, as affording the <lb/>benefits of mutual insurance to the working classes, <lb/>the lowest rates consistent with perfect security. <lb/>The funds, we understand, are in a prosperous state.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Hay and Straw.</hi> –In consequence of it having been <lb/>alleged last Wednesday, that higher prices were got <lb/>for straw than those quoted, we have made due in<lb break="no"/>quiry, and find there are no grounds for such an alle<lb break="no"/>gation. We have been further assured, that in re<lb break="no"/>porting the prices of hay and straw for these two years <lb/>past, the clerk of the corn market has never shown a <lb/>desire to favour the farm servants at the expense of <lb/>their employers, or to favour either party at the ex<lb break="no"/>pense of the public.</p>
                <p>The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have <lb/>been pleased to grant by their warrant, dated the 6th <lb/>of April 1836, a distinguishing flag to be worn by the <lb/>respective vessels belonging to the Eastern Regatta <lb/>Club of Scotland, viz. a blue cornet flag, with a white <lb/>St Andrew's cross on the upper quarter on a red field.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Heriot's Hospital.</hi> –At the meeting of the <lb/>Governors of George Heriot's Hospital, on Thursday <lb/>the 7th instant, the estimate of Messrs Trotter for <lb/>alterations and repairs on the chapel, amounting to <lb/>t935, was accepted, and it will gratify the friends of <lb/>economy to learn, that this is t65 under the sum <lb/>voted by a majority of the Governors for that purpose <lb/>some time ago. Thereafter a unanimous vote of <lb/>thanks was passed to Councillor Gillespie Graham, <lb/>for gratuitously furnishing a plan of the intended <lb/>improvements on the chapel, which was described by <lb/>Councillor Grant and others, as highly creditable to <lb/>the skill and good taste of that distinguished archi<lb break="no"/>tect. The Governors then proceeded to consider the <lb/>list of applications for admission of boys, preparatory <lb/>to the usual half-yearly election. There were 16 <lb/>vacancies and 37 applicants, who may be thus <lb/>classed :–</p>
                <p>Those who have never received benefit from <lb/>George Heriot's Hospital, or any other insti<lb break="no"/>tution, 12 <lb/>Those who have received benefit for one <lb/>child, 13 <lb/>Do. for two children, 6 <lb/>Do. for three children, 5 <lb/>Do. for five children, 1 <lb/>37</p>
                <p>In considering cases the present practise of the Go<lb break="no"/>vernors is to give preference, first to children of wi<lb break="no"/>dows (being poor), then to those who have never re<lb break="no"/>ceived benefit, afterwards those who have had only <lb/>one child in, and so on. These were but three appli<lb break="no"/>cations for widow's children, and one for an orphan, <lb/>out of the above number, and it is therefore probable, <lb/>considering the large population of Edinburgh, that <lb/>it is not sufficiently known, that George Heriot, in <lb/>his will, expressly points out the <hi rend="italic">fatherless</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">poor</hi>, <lb/>being children of burgesses and freemen, as the ob<lb break="no"/>jects of his charity–hence, if there be not a sufficient <lb/>numbers of really necessitous cases, the Governors, in <lb/>filling up the vacancies, may elect some that do not <lb/>appear to have strong claims, simply from those that <lb/>have such claims not coming forward in sufficient <lb/>numbers. <cb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Political Economy.</hi> –On Thursday last the <lb/>course of lectures on Political Economy, delivered by <lb/>Dr Thomas Murray, in Elder Street Chapel, was <lb/>brought to a conclusion ; on which occasion the thanks <lb/>of the meeting were, on the motion of one of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of committe, voted by acclamation to the lecturer <lb/>for his valuable services. After thanks had been re<lb break="no"/>turned by Dr Murray, Mr A. G. Hunter, merchant, <lb/>was called to the Chair, and some conversation having <lb/>taken place, the committee of management, who had <lb/>necessarily been self-elected, were confirmed by the <lb/>meeting in their office, and empowered to take such <lb/>steps as they might think expedient for obtaining <lb/>lectures to the industrious classes next winter. We <lb/>understand that Dr Murray is to be entertained at <lb/>supper, some evening next week, on the occasion of <lb/>being presented with a piece of silver plate.</p>
                <p>It is with much regret we learn that John Grieve, <lb/>Esq. of Newington Cottage, died on Monday last. <lb/>He was beloved and esteemed for his estimable quali<lb break="no"/>ties by all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance, <lb/>and his death will be long and deeply regretted.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">The Theatre</hi>.–Mr C. Kean concluded his en<lb break="no"/>gagement on Thursday evening–an engagement <lb/>the longest and most brilliant of any that our <lb/>Theatre has witnessed for many years. Mr Kean <lb/>has been with us for a whole month, and has suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded in crowding the house almost every night. <lb/>We understand that upwards of 30,000 persons have <lb/>visited the theatre during his engagement–a number <lb/>beyond that of any former period of equal duration. <lb/>In that time he has appeared in some of the most <lb/>arduous and difficult of Shakespeare's characters <lb/>Hamlet, Richard, Macbeth, Othello, Shylock, and <lb/>King John, investing each with its own peculiar <lb/>charms and interest, and exciting the highest admira<lb break="no"/>tion and astonishment at the versatility and power of <lb/>his genius, which could give such individuality and <lb/>truth to so many dissimilar, distinct, and separate <lb/>classes of characters. The play with which his en<lb break="no"/>gagement concluded was Richard, which character he has <lb/>performed <hi rend="italic">seven</hi>  times during his engagement ; the house <lb/>was, as usual, crowded in every part, and he exerted <lb/>himself most strenuously and successfully. At the con<lb break="no"/>clusion the cheers of the audience were loud and long, <lb/>and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage <lb/>from different parts of the house. Mr K. being loud<lb break="no"/>ly called for, appeared in front of the stage, and de<lb break="no"/>livered the following very neat and appropriate ad<lb break="no"/>dress:–" <hi rend="italic">Ladies and Gentlemen,</hi> –I now stand before <lb/>you for the last time this season, but believe me <lb/>whichever way my pilgrimage may bend, my thoughts <lb/>will ever recur to Edinburgh as those of a child to <lb/>its distant home, fondly anticipating the hour when <lb/>he shall again stand upon its threshold. (Great cheer<lb break="no"/>ing.) Till that period permit me with a heavy, but a <lb/>grateful heart, to pronounce that melancholy word– <lb/>farewell." (Mr Kean then withdrew amidst reiterated <lb/>and enthusiastic plaudits from all parts of the house.) <lb/>–Mr K. we perceive, appears next in Aberdeen, <lb/>where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his <lb/>performances. The boxes there, we are told, are al<lb break="no"/>ready taken for several successive nights to come.– <lb/>Mrs Honey, from the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, <lb/>makes her appearance here on Monday first.</p>
                <p>On Wednesday evening, Mr John G. Moxey, <lb/>baker, Castle Street, was entertained at supper, in <lb/>Menzie's Hotel and Tavern, Waterloo Place, by a <lb/>party of friends, of about fifty in number, previous to his <lb/>leaving this country for America, to which he is about <lb/>to emigrate. The company was very harmonious, and <lb/>the compliment must have been very gratifying to <lb/>Mr Moxey.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Qualifications of General Assembly Elders.</hi> –The <lb/>Presbytery of Cupar, at their meeting on the 29th ult. <lb/>elected the Earl of Leven and Melville, and Walter <lb/>Malcolm, Esq. Edinburgh, to represent them in the <lb/>ensuing Assembly. Mr Malcolm is factor for Cap<lb break="no"/>tain Hay of Mugdrum, who is principal heritor in <lb/>the parish of Newburgh, and was lately ordained an <lb/>elder there. Against his election to serve in the As<lb break="no"/>sembly a protest and appeal were taken, on the grounds, <lb/>as we understand, that he has no domicile within the <lb/>bounds of Presbytery, and is not an officiating elder; <lb/>the protesters allowing that his election, though con<lb break="no"/>sistent with the letter, is contrary to the spirit of an <lb/>act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal is <lb/>sustained, it is evident that a large proportion of the <lb/>Assembly elders must vacate their seats. Intimation <lb/>also was given by D. Maitland M'Gill, Esq., that <lb/>when the commissions came to be attested, he would <lb/>move for evidence being produced that the elders-elect <lb/>maintain family worship. An amusing inquiry was <lb/>instituted in the Presbytery last year respecting the <lb/>Earl of Leven's habits of domestic devotion ; and a <lb/>clerical member had the candour to say, he should <lb/>wish to know how it was with the ministers themselves <lb/>in that respect.</p>
                <p>The University of St Andrews has just conferred <lb/>the degree of Doctor of Divinity on the Rev. Professor <lb/>Paxton, of Edinburgh. In bestowing this public <lb/>honour on one, who, during a long and useful life, has <lb/>done so much for the cause of literature and religion, <lb/>the members of the College have done an act which <lb/>shows that they can appreciate real merit, and which <lb/>will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious pub<lb break="no"/>lic of Scotland. Those who have had the good for<lb break="no"/>tune to enjoy the public ministrations of Professor <lb/>Paxton, and even the general church-going commu<lb break="no"/>nity, are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence, <lb/>of the pious and heartfelt warmth, and of the classical <lb/>elegance which have long characterised his public <lb/>preaching. Even beyond the religious body of which <lb/>he is the ornament, he is well known as one of the <lb/>most popular and impressive teachers of the day. In <lb/>his lectures on Theology, as Professor to the General <lb/>Associate Synod, and afterwards to the Associate <lb/>Synod, he displayed the results of an extensive and <lb/>profound critical study of the Scriptures, and of an <lb/>unwearied research into the Natural History, and the <lb/>manners and usages of the ancients nations. The <lb/>work by which he is chiefly known as an author– <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">The Illustrations of Scripture</hi> –will long bear testi<lb break="no"/>mony to the extent of his learning, and of his Orien<lb break="no"/>tal investigations, and to his powers of lucid and elo<lb break="no"/>quent composition. We understand that the attention <lb/>of the College was directed to Mr Paxton's merits by <lb/>the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages. <lb/>This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the <lb/>same field of study, reflects high honour on the dis<lb break="no"/>crimination and the heart of Mr Tennant.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Public Dinner to Professor Dick.</hi> –On Tuesday <lb/>last, the Students ofthe Edinburgh Veterinary Col<lb break="no"/>lege and a number of Veterinary Surgeons and other <lb/>gentlemen (in all upwards of 70) from various parts <lb/>of Scotland, entertained Professor Dick to a public <lb/>dinner in the Waterloo Hotel. John Lambert, Esq. <lb/>in the Chair, and Alexander Gordon, jun Esq. crou<lb break="no"/>pier. The stewards were Ed. Pyper, Esq. of West <lb/>Craigs, J. R. Laing, Esq. jun of Dunkenny, Sa<lb break="no"/>muel Wordsworth, jun. Esq. W.S., Dr Malcolm, <lb/>James Miller, Esq. and George Rennie, Esq.– <lb/>Amongst the gentlemen present we observed Professors <lb/>Low and Lizars ; Drs Robertson, Spittal, Knox, and <lb/>Aitken, Mr Ferguson, surgeon ; J. B. Murdoch, <lb/>Esq. of Coldoch; Charles Gordon, Esq. Secretary <lb/>to the Highland Society of Scotland ; A. T. Black<lb break="no"/>wood, Esq. of Oggs Castle ; Mr Dick, senior &amp;c. <lb/>The cloth having been removed and the usual loyal <lb/>toasts drank, the chairman, in a neat and appropriate <lb/>speech, proposed the health of Professor Dick, to <lb/>whom the present meeting had assembled to do ho<lb break="no"/>nour, and who at once commanded their esteem as a <lb/>member of society and their admiration as a man of <lb/>talent, which toast was drank with the greatest en<lb break="no"/>thusiasm. The chairman then proposed his Grace <lb/>the Duke of Gordon and the Highland and Agricul<lb break="no"/>tural Society of Scotland, Patrons of the Edinburgh <lb/>Veterinary College, which was followed by a variety <lb/>of other appropriate toasts. Many excellent songs <lb/>were sung, and the conviviality of the evening was <lb/>kept up until a late hour.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Royal Infirmary</hi> –We understand that the Ste<lb break="no"/>wards of the late Fancy Ball for the benefit of the <lb/>Royal Infirmary have, by their judicious arrange<lb break="no"/>ments in the management of the ball, been enabled to <lb/>pay over to the trustees of that institution, (after de<lb break="no"/>ducting all expenses) the sum of t432, 7s. 8d. The <lb/>managers of the Infirmary, as well as the public at <lb/>large, are certainly much indebted to the gentlemen <lb/>who acted as stewards upon that occasion, for their <lb/>valuable extertions, particularly at the present time, in <lb/>support of this great and useful institution, for the <lb/>relief of those labouring under the united calamities <lb/>of indigence and disease.</p>

               <pb/>Papers from Madras to the 17th of January have <lb/>been received. Accounts had arrived through Singa<lb break="no"/>pore, from the ship Mangles, stating that when pass<lb break="no"/>ing through Torres Straits she touched at Murray's <lb/>Island, where they discovered eight Europeans, part <lb/>of the crew of the long-missing bark, Charles Eaton, <lb/>in a state of slavery, but the natives would not deliver <lb/>up the men. The Charles Eaton was supposed to <lb/>have been lost on the Barrier Reef, in Torres Straits, <lb/>in 1833, in prosecution of her voyage from New South <lb/>Wales to Madras, but no precise intelligence of her <lb/>fate was previously known. The ironworks which <lb/>had been erected at Porto Novo were proceeding with <lb/>activity, and some railing had been made there, quite <lb/>equal, it is stated to anything og the kind manufac<lb break="no"/>tured in England.</p>

               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">(From a Correspondent.)</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Our penal settlements appear to be very indifferent<lb break="no"/>ly managed; and we are glad to find that such a man <lb/>as Sir John Franklin is appointed to govern Van Die<lb break="no"/>men's Land; and the sooner an improved system is <lb/>adopted for New South Wales, the better. Not only <lb/>are men sent out to govern who are ignorant of human <lb/>nature, a knowledge of which is essential to the manage<lb break="no"/>ment of the heterogenous materials of our penal colo<lb break="no"/>nies; but when the Government at home opens its eyes <lb/>to any proposal for improvement,it is mismanaged. Our <lb/>rulers have the sense to see the importance of sending <lb/>our respectable females to these colonies ; but they trust <lb/>an Emigration Committee, and this committee trusts <lb/>individuals who desire to make the most of the con<lb break="no"/>cern ; and we are glad to have an opportunity of mak<lb break="no"/>ing the public acquainted with the mode in which <lb/>the business is conducted, in the hope that some hu<lb break="no"/>mane Member of Parliament will take the subject <lb/>up. The mode of managing female emigration is <lb/>this :–</p>
                <p>A temptation, in the first place, is held out of a <lb/>free passage to Australia. A ship is hired, and this <lb/>ship must ave a <hi rend="italic">full</hi>  cargo, to satisfy the <hi rend="italic">owners. </hi>
               <lb/>Advertisements are issued, and instead of hard work<lb break="no"/>ing females, a parcel of decayed governesses, dress<lb break="no"/>makers, &amp;c. &amp;c., with a small mixture of better <lb/>articles, is made up. But if, as almost always hap<lb break="no"/>pens, a sufficient number of these to fill the ship <lb/>does not come forward, a supply of sweepings <lb/>is taken from a workhouse! Here, then, is such a <lb/>mixture of good, bad, and indifferent, to the amount <lb/>of two hundred and upwards, that there is enough <lb/>of evil to corrupt the good. As to the comfort of the <lb/>poor creatures they are crammed <hi rend="smallcaps">four into one </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">bed</hi>  !</p>
                <p>Such is the power of jobbing, that we happen to <lb/>know the fact, that some young women of respectabi<lb break="no"/>lity who wished to go to New South Wales <hi rend="italic">with their </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">friends</hi>, were refused a free passage, unless they went <lb/>to London to go in the Government ship ! Thus we <lb/>see that the interests of agents and shipowners over<lb break="no"/>comes the interests of the colonies, and actually ob<lb break="no"/>structs the attainment of the object in view. We find <lb/>blindness a very common ailment in every department <lb/>of Government ; and however desirous our rulrs may <lb/>be to reform every abuse, and to adopt useful mea<lb break="no"/>sures, they are often thwarted by the necessity (which <lb/>ought not to exist) of conciliating harpies and leeches, <lb/>which devour the public substance, and suck the pub<lb break="no"/>lic blood. Reform has, as yet, only begun to clean <lb/>the outside of the platter ; and it may not reach the <lb/>inside in our day. It is the duty, however, of all pa<lb break="no"/>triots, to sharpen the knife that is to cut out corruption <lb/>from the heart of the commonwealth, by means of ex<lb break="no"/>posure of every abuse that comes to be known, and to <lb/>support those who are willing to apply it.</p>
                <p>As in a matter of so much importance nothing <lb/>should be concealed, there is no hesitation in stating <lb/>that it consists with our knowledge that, after the <lb/>Emigration Committee in Van Diemen's Land, detail<lb break="no"/>ing the deplorable consequences of sending out young <lb/>women from workhouses, a ship has actually sailed, <lb/>nearly filled up as we have described. When any <lb/>representation is made to a public office, the matter is <lb/>said to belong to another department ; and that other <lb/>department says it is not its province to interfere ; and <lb/>thus humanity is made the shuttlecock to the battle<lb break="no"/>dore of jobbing and the blindness of office.</p>
                <p>If our brethren of the press will take up this, the <lb/>inhuman job will be put an end to.</p>

               <lb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Walter</hi>  moved, pursuant to notice, that "an hum<lb break="no"/>ble address be presented to his Majesty, praying that he will <lb/>be graciously pleased to issue his royal orders that a placard <lb/>entitled "Emigration to Van Diemen's Land," which the se<lb break="no"/>veral postmasters throughout the kingdom have been directed <lb/>to put in a conspicuous place in their several post-offices, and <lb/>to circulate among the clergy and the parochial authorities <lb/>be withdrawn." He had been assured y several gentlemen <lb/>who had returned from Van Diemen's land, that many of the <lb/>young females sent out by the Emigration committee had <lb/>been irrevocable consigned to prostitution, and that such as <lb/>obtained services found themselves placed among a very dif<lb break="no"/>ferent calss of persons to that which they had been accustom<lb break="no"/>ed to mix with in this country. The hon. member read an <lb/>extract from a Hobart Town paper, of the 19th of February <lb/>last, in which it was stated that some of the females "thus <lb/>launched into the world," were not more than twelve of thir<lb break="no"/>teen years old.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Wakley</hi>  seconded the motion. <lb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir G. Grey</hi>  adverted to the extraordinary object of the <lb/>address, when the information desired had in fact already <lb/>been given on a former day. He hoped, whatever informa<lb break="no"/>tion, correct or erroneous, might be circulated on the subject <lb/>of emigration, that the people of England would not adopt <lb/>their notions from anonymous paragraphs in Hobart Town <lb/>newspapers. According to the hon. member there was a sys<lb break="no"/>tem in operation by which people were driven out of the <lb/>country–actually turned out of it, as if they were so many <lb/>slaves. Now he could declare that there could be no more <lb/>unfounded statement than this. Though much good had ari<lb break="no"/>sen to the colonies and individuals, yet it could not be denied <lb/>that, in some instances, youn women had turned out badly <lb/>They had these facts upon authority–that many of those fe<lb break="no"/>males obtained respectable places. The names of the indivi<lb break="no"/>duals who obtained them, the dates of their arrival, the <lb/>mode of their meployment, were all to be found int he papers <lb/>on the table of the house. In conclusion, he begged of the <lb/>hon. member and others, when statements relative to emi<lb break="no"/>gration were made, to receive them with caution and reserve.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr C. Lushington</hi>  defended the proceedigs of the Emi<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>gration Committee. he mainted that by their labours the <lb/>greatest posible good had been accomplished, hear, hear.) <lb/>He would then ask of any one to look at the names of the gentle<lb break="no"/>men who were on that committee–to look at their charac<lb break="no"/>ters; and could any one who did so believe that the members <lb/>of that committee would be guilty of the sin of sendng out, <lb/>day after day, young females to the colonies–of thus duping <lb/>those unprotected creatures to their destruction? (hear, hear.)</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Walter</hi>  replied. He had not relied for his state<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ments upon newspapers, but upon official documents.</p>
                <p>The motion was negatived without a division.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">The Wool Trade, London, Thursday Evening.</hi> –The follow<lb break="no"/>ing are more accurate averages of the sales of Colonial Wools <lb/>which have recently taken place than we were enabled to ob<lb break="no"/>tain during their progress.</p>
                <p>The Colonial Wools offered consisted of 2041 bays. The <lb/>Wools have become much improved in growth, in length of <lb/>staple, in management, and in washing. The market being <lb/>very bare in combining wool, this description realized a propor<lb break="no"/>tionate advance. Several flocks attracted great attention, <lb/>particularly those market T A in a square, I X and Y, <lb/>which show that great pains have been paid by the growers <lb/>upon them. The correct averages obtained are as follows :–</p>

                <p>The frist class of Van Diemen's Land Wool realised a consi<lb break="no"/>derable rise upon last year's sales, the produce of the same <lb/>flocks then selling only at 2s 2d to 2s 5d per lb.</p>
                <p>The Wool Trade is very brisk. The arrivals this week have <lb/>been 2300 bales, of which about 340 are German, 1000 Spa<lb break="no"/>nish, 300 New South Wales, 20 Cape of Good Hope, 50 Tur<lb break="no"/>key, and 500 bales of South American Woo's.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Huddersfield, Tuesday</hi>.–There has been no visible change <lb/>in the state of this market for the last three or four weeks. <lb/>Business in general is pretty good.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Bradford, June</hi>  30.–The activity we have so often had to <lb/>report in the piece market continues unabated, and in six <lb/>quarters, especially low and middle sorts, trade to-day is par<lb break="no"/>ticularly brisk. Whatever alteration there may be in the <lb/>yarn market, as compared with recent reports, is for the bet<lb break="no"/>ter. Stocks continue low in the staplers' hands, with very <lb/>little disposition to increase them. Prices remain very steady, <lb/>although the demand for wool is extremely limited. Farmers <lb/>are rather firmer. The Liverpool sales of New South Wales <lb/>Wool went off 1d to 2d per lb. above the recent London sales.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Rochdale, June</hi>  27.–The market this week was very well <lb/>attended, but not so brisk as the last.–Low goods were much <lb/>in demand, and sold well. The trade in Rochdale is generally <lb/>good at present, and building is going on to a very considerale <lb/>extent.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">York Wool Market, June</hi>  30.–The quantity of wool brought <lb/>to this day's market, was not so large as that supplied last <lb/>week, nor was the attendance of buyers so numerous, yet a <lb/>considerable portion of business was done, and last week's <lb/>quotations were fully supported :–good, bred hog 18 1/2d ; half <lb/>hog and ewe, 16 1/2d to 17d ; all ewe, 15d to 15 1/2d ; locks without <lb/>cots 10 1/2 to 11 1/2d ; ditto with cots 11d to 12 1/2d per lb.</p>

                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi>  have received the first annual Report of <lb/>new colony of South Australia, a Parliamentary paper <lb/>presented in June last. The site selected for the <lb/>colony is a part of the south coast of New Holland, <lb/>extending two or three hundred miles on each side of <lb/>Spencer's Gulf, and about 600 miles into the interior. <lb/>It was anticipated that the best central station would <lb/>be Port Lincoln at the entrance of Spencer's Gulf, on <lb/>the west side, or Nepean Bay, on the north coast of <lb/>Kangaroo Isle. Port Lincoln is in latitude 35, and <lb/>east longitude 136, about 700 miles right west from <lb/>Sydney, the same distance north-west from Van Die<lb break="no"/>men's Land, and about 1000 miles eastward of the co<lb break="no"/>lony at King George's Sound. Nepean Bay is about <lb/>100 miles east from Port Lincoln. The colony is <lb/>established under Parliamentary Commissioners, as <lb/>an experiment, we believe, to try whether it may not <lb/>be possible to execute an extensive plan of emigration <lb/>without any charge to the country, by selling lots of <lb/>land at such a price as would defray the expense of <lb/>conveying the emigrants from England. The plan <lb/>adopted is, to send out preferably young married per<lb break="no"/>sons under thirty, and to admit no slaves or convicts <lb/>into the colony. A company has embarked t35,000 <lb/>in the enterprise. A surveying vessel was sent out in <lb/>March to examine the coast carefully, that the <lb/>best site might be chosen at first, and the ne<lb break="no"/>cessity of removal avoided. Six vessels altogether <lb/>had sailed down to the 1st May, carrying out 152 male <lb/>labourers with 37 females, and 26 male and 10 fe<lb break="no"/>males of a superior class. These numbers include 26 <lb/>children. The Commissioners attempted at first to <lb/>get 20s. per acre for the land ; but finding it impos<lb break="no"/>sible, they reduced the price to 12s. By selling at <lb/>this price 437 lots, consisting each of a country sec<lb break="no"/>tion of 134 acres, and a town section of one acre, they <lb/>had raised the t35,000 required by the act of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment as the condition of the grant of land. We give <lb/>these few details to put our readers in a condition to <lb/>understand the notices which appear from time to <lb/>time in the papers respecting the colony. We hope <lb/>the Commissioners or the adventurers will give the <lb/>country a distinctive name. The title of "South <lb/>Australia" is bad any way, and even positively ab<lb break="no"/>surd ; since Australia ( <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi>  Australasia,) originally <lb/>intended for New Holland, has already begun to be <lb/>monopolised by Van Diemen's Land. The district <lb/>at Spencer's Gulf, if it is to participated in the general <lb/>denomination, should be termed "North" rather than <lb/>"South" Australia. By the way, most of our colonies <lb/>in that quarter of the world have ridiculous names, as <lb/>is instantly perceived when we coin a nationa term for <lb/>the people out of them. What can be worse than a <lb/>"Van Diemen-lander ;" a "New South-Wales-ian ;" <lb/>a "Swan River-ite ;" or a "King-George's Sound<lb break="no"/>ian ! !"</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Highland Emigrants.</hi> –The ship " Midlo<lb break="no"/>thian" has just been fitted up at Leith for the reception <lb/>of Highland emigrants, which she is to take in at the <lb/>Isle of Skye for Sydney, New South Wales. These <lb/>emigrants are, we believw, to be carried out at a very <lb/>small cost to themselves, the largest portion of the <lb/>passage money being paid by Government out of the <lb/>land revenue of New South Wales, which is exclusive<lb break="no"/>ly appropriated towards the encouragement and promo<lb break="no"/>tion of emigration–the objects in view being, as well <lb/>the relief of those districts in this country which <lb/>are suffering from the want of employment and <lb/>subsistence, as by the introduction into that colony of <lb/>a body of well disposed and virtuous free emigrant fami<lb break="no"/>lies and individuals, the promotion of the moral welfare <lb/>of the colonists generally. The emigrants will, we be<lb break="no"/>lieve, receive employment in New South Wales as <lb/>farm-servants, shepherds, overseers, &amp;c. We had a <lb/>brief inspection of the " Midlothian" on Monday af<lb break="no"/>ternoon, and found it to be a very fine vessel, fitted <lb/>up in a manner the most comfortable and convenient <lb/>that could well be effected. She sails this afternoon <lb/>from Leith to the Isle of Skye.</p>

               <pb/>Thus the British Government is multiplying its <lb/>colonies round the shores of New Holland. Exclusive <lb/>of Van Diemen's Land, which forms a separate island, <lb/>we have first on the eastern shore the old settlement of <lb/>Port Jackson ; a second recently formed at Port Philip, <lb/>500 miles south from Sidney ; a third just described, at <lb/>St. Vincent's Gulf, 500 miles west from Port Philip ; <lb/>a fourth at King George's Sound, 1100 miles west <lb/>from St Vincent's Gulf ; a fifth at Swan River, 250 <lb/>miles north from King George's South. All these <lb/>colonies are in the temperate zone, between the lati<lb break="no"/>tudes of 30 and 38, and will have nearly the <lb/>same climate. We had one at Melville Island, <lb/>on the north coast, within the torried zone, in latitude <lb/>12 ; but it was found to be very unhealthy, and was <lb/>abandoned, after a short trial, ten years ago.</p>
                <p>Though the interior of New Holland, so far as <lb/>hitherto explored, is one of the most barren and un<lb break="no"/>promising lands in the world, there is a margin of <lb/>good soil round the greater part of its coasts, capabale <lb/>[?] of supporting twenty or thirty or fifty mil<lb break="no"/> 
               <cb/>lions of inhabitants; and there is little doubt that, in <lb/>the course of three centuries, it will be the seat of a <lb/>great and powerful nation, cultivating the arts, and <lb/>speaking the language of Britain, and contributing <lb/>powerfully to spread civilisation over the Southern <lb/>Hemisphere.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration</hi>
            </p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi>  Annual Report on Emigration just issued <lb/>contains, besides the usual, correspondences and <lb/>documents connected with the plan which has been <lb/>some time in operation, of transferring labourers from <lb/>India to the Mauritius, and which it is now proposed <lb/>to extend to New South Wales. Leaving this sub<lb break="no"/>jest for the present, we shall state the general results[?] <lb/>of the emigration to Canada.</p>
                <p>The Report shows, that the whole number of <lb/>emigrants who landed at Quebec or Montreal, in the <lb/>last nine years, was 259,788[?], averaging very nearly <lb/>29,000 per annum. The years of greatest emigration <lb/>were 1831 and 1832, the numbers for these years be<lb break="no"/>ing respectively 50,254 and 51,746. The proportions[?] [?] <lb/>furnished by the three kingdoms in the nine years <lb/>were as follows :–Among eight emigrants there were <lb/>five Irishmen, two Englishmen, and one Scotsman. <lb/>Scotland in proportion to its population has sent off <lb/>three times as many emigrants, and Ireland about <lb/>nine times as may as England; and it should be <lb/>added, that a certain part of the emigration from <lb/>England is artificial, consisting of paupers sent out at <lb/>the expense of their parishes. Emigrations offers the <lb/>most natural, practicable, and safe means of relieving a <lb/>country of its redundant or unemployed population ; <lb/>and it may be asked, why it is so much less resorted to <lb/>in England than in Scotland and Ireland? It cannot[?] <lb/>be the ignorance of the English, for this would lead <lb/>to the inference that the Irish, who emigrate in the <lb/>largest numbers, were the best informed of the three <lb/>nations. It is, we apprehend, nothing but the Poor <lb/>Laws, which hold out to the labourer the certainty of <lb/>a subsistence at home, however idle or improvident he <lb/>may be, and render him averse to live in the colo<lb break="no"/>nies, where he would have no such resource. This is <lb/>only one of the many evils which these laws have pro<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>duced, not only to the country at large, but to the la<lb break="no"/>bouring classes themselves, whose average condition <lb/>was greatly deteriorated, while only a fraction of their <lb/>number shared the benefit of the allowance. We <lb/>speak of the Poor Laws as they existed before the Act <lb/>of 1834 was passed.</p>
                <p>The number of emigrants who went to Canada <lb/>last year was 21,901, of whom 1399 went from <lb/>Scotland, 5580 from England, 14,538 from <lb/>Ireland, and 274 from Nova Scotia, Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, or the West Indies. In 1836 the number of <lb/>emigrants was 27,728. The ports in Scotland from <lb/>which the greatest numbers sail are Greenock, Leith, <lb/>Aberdeen, and Cromarty. Of the emigrants in 1837, <lb/>4000 settled in Lower Canada, 16,300 in Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>da, 1500 went to the United States, and ninety-two <lb/>died in the hospital or quarantine station.</p>
                <p>In the same period of nine years, 236,288[?] British <lb/>emigrants have landed at new York, or fully 26,000 <lb/>per annum on average. There is a great fluctua-[?] <lb/>tion in the number. In 1833 and 1835 it was only <lb/>16,000 ; in 1837 it was 34,000 ; in 1836 no less than <lb/>59,075 ; and addingthe 27,728 who went to Canada, <lb/>no less than 86,800 persons must have landed at New <lb/>York and Quebec from the British Isles in [?]. <lb/>There is a discrepancy, however, between this account <lb/>and another in a different Return, also newly pub<lb break="no"/>lished. The Report of the "Agent-General for Emi<lb break="no"/>gration," makes the number who went to the United <lb/>States from Britain in 1836, only 37,774. The for<lb break="no"/>mer probably comprehends all British born subjects, <lb/>including persons from Nova Scotia, Canada, and the <lb/>West Indies, and probably all passengers, many of <lb/>whom returned.</p>
                <p>The Agent-General gives the number of persons <lb/>who emigrated to the British Colonies and the United <lb/>States for every year since 1825. We present merely <lb/>the average for the last year seven years.</p>
                <p>Annual number of Emigrants from Britain to <lb/>North American Colonies, 39[?],00 <lb/>Ditto do. to United States, 34,[?]00 <lb/>Ditto do. to Cape of Good Hope, 20[?] <lb/>Ditto do. to Australian Colonies, 3[?]0 <lb/>73[?],[?]</p>
                <p>In 1832, the number who emigrated to these Colo<lb break="no"/>nies was no less than 103,140. The number who <lb/>went out to Australia in 1837, was much greater than <lb/>in any preceding year, being 5054.</p>
                <p>If we assume that each emigrant pays for his pas<lb break="no"/>sage, &amp;c., or has in his pocket t30, the average net[?] <lb/>expended on emigration will be about two millions per <lb/>annum. It may be correctly stated now, that human <lb/>beings form no inconsiderable <hi rend="italic">item</hi>, in number and <lb/>value, of our exports. In the case of Ireland we sup<lb break="no"/>pose it is by far the most flourishing, and by no means <lb/>the least advantageous branch of the national com<lb break="no"/>merce.</p>
                <p>The annual increment of the population of <lb/>British Isles is about 330,000, independently of the <lb/>efflux by emigration ; but including this, it must be <lb/>about 420,000. It follows that there are about [?] <lb/>more inhabitants in the country each day than there <lb/>were on the day before. Of the 1150 additional mortals[?] <lb/>emigration carries off 200.</p>
                <p>The establishment of steam navigation across the <lb/>Atlantic will, no doubt, give a new impulse to the <lb/>circulation of human beings, while the construction of <lb/>railroads across the Alleganies, and of canals in Canada, <lb/>will greatly increase the capacity of the western world <lb/>to absorb the imported multitudes. In seven years <lb/>hence, the journey from London to Missouri will be <lb/>shorter in point of time, and perhaps cheaper, than the <lb/>journey from Washington to Missouri was seven years <lb/>ago. A religious man might see something like the <lb/>finger of Providence in the fact, that just at the time <lb/>France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, <lb/>begin to feel severely the pressure of a redundant po<lb break="no"/>pulation, inventions have started into existence which <lb/>may be said to annihilate space, and bring the most <lb/>thinly inhabited parts of the world, into juxtaposition <lb/>with the most overpeopled.</p>
                <p>From the American Almanac, we find that the num<lb break="no"/>ber of passengers who arrived in the United States in <lb/>1836, was 81,000, of whom 4000 were native Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans. The proportion of emigrants from the different <lb/>foreign countries was–</p>
                <p>From the British Isles, 47,792 <lb/>... British American Colonies, 2,681 <lb/>... Germany, 20,142 <lb/>... France, 4,443 <lb/>... Prussia, 563 <lb/>... Switzerland, 465 <lb/>... Denmark, 414 <lb/>... Holland, 298 <lb/>... Mexico, 797 <lb/>... Texas, 698 <lb/>... Cuba, 516 <lb/>... Other countries, 2,152</p>
                <p>Some curious inferences might be drawn from this <lb/>table, as to the motives which induce men to leave <lb/>their native country. <hi rend="italic">Celeris paribus</hi>, there is most <lb/>emigration where there is most intelligence. Thus, <lb/>Spain, Portugal, Sardinia, Naples, the Papal States, <lb/>and Austria, furnish no emigrants to American, while <lb/>Britain and Germany furnish a vast number. Much, <lb/>however, must depend on the domestic condition of <lb/>the country, and on the greater or less facilities for <lb/>removing. Thus, considering its inland position, and <lb/>the small number of its inhabitants, the spirit of emi<lb break="no"/>gration must be much more active in Switzerland, <lb/>which sends out 445 persons, than in France, which <lb/>sends out 4443.</p>
                <p>The magistrates of New York, it appears, con<lb break="no"/>sider the influx of emigrants a nuisance, and it <lb/>would seem, from an expression of Mr Buchanan's, the <lb/>agent at Quebec, that they had laid a tax of ten dol<lb break="no"/>lars upon all who arrive with an intention of settling. <lb/>The key to this proceeding is no doubt to be found in <lb/>the following facts. A Board of Aldermen reported in <lb/>June last, that the expense of City Almshouses in the <lb/>preceding year were 205,500 dollars, or t44,000 ; that <lb/>of 1209 persons admitted in a certain period, 932 were <lb/>aliens ; and that the whole number under the charge <lb/>of the Commissioners was 3074, of whom three-fourths <lb/>were foreigners. A communication from the Mayor <lb/>at the same time says:–" Nearly 2000 emigrants arrive <lb/>each week ; our streets are filled with the wandering <lb/>crowds of those passengers, clustering in our city, <lb/>unaccustomed to our climate, without money, without <lb/>employment, without friends, many not speaking our <lb/>language, without any dependence for food, or rainment[?], <lb/>or fireside." In Boston and Philadelphia, also, nearly <lb/>one-half of the inmates of the almshouses were foreign<lb break="no"/>ers.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Commission of the General Assembly</hi>
            </p>
                <p>On Wednesday, the Commission of Assembly met in <lb/>the Tolbooth Church–Dr Muir, Moderator, in the <lb/>chair.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">The Presbyterian Church in New South Wales. </hi>
               <lb/>–The Moderator recalled to the notice of the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion, that on a former meeting, they had directed him <lb/>to write to Lord Glenelg, Secretary for the Colonies, <lb/>disavowing connection with Dr Lang in New South <lb/>Wales, and blaming his proceedings in that colony, in <lb/>separating himself from the Presbytery there formed in <lb/>connection with the Church of Scotland. Since that <lb/>time he had had a communication from Lord Glenelg, <lb/>which he was sure would be received by the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion with great satisfaction.</p>
                <p>The communication from Lord Glenelg was then <lb/>read. It consisted of a copy of the despatch transmit<lb break="no"/>ted to the Governor of New South Wales, approving <lb/>of his conduct in withholding the salaries of the Pres<lb break="no"/>byterian laymen who had not submitted themselves to <lb/>the authority of the Presbytery in connection with the <lb/>Church of Scotland, and further directing that Dr <lb/>Lang's salary should be discontinued. His lordship <lb/>explained, that in doing this the Government had no <lb/>wish to constitute themselves judges in any ecclesias<lb break="no"/>tical disputes ; but as the salaries awarded to these <lb/>gentlemen had been given on the faith that they were <lb/>to remain in connection with the Church of Scotland, <lb/>they could not be continued so long as they defied her <lb/>authority.</p>
                <p>On the motion of Mr Dunlop, the Commission una<lb break="no"/>nimously expressed their satisfaction with the prompti<lb break="no"/>tude and decision which the Government had shown <lb/>in the matter ; and directed the Moderator to commu<lb break="no"/>nicate their minute to Lord Glenelg. It was also agreed <lb/>to re-appoint the Committee to watch over the farther <lb/>proceedings, especially as it was understoof that Dr <lb/>Lang was now on his way to this country.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Case of Small Isles.</hi> –The Commission, then pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded to take up the case of Small Isles, which, it will <lb/>be recollected, arose out of the Rev. Mr M'Lean hav<lb break="no"/>ing, as was alleged, appeared in the lobby of the As<lb break="no"/>sembly House, while that Court was sitting in May last, <lb/>in a state of intoxication. The case occupied the Court <lb/>a considerable part of the day; and at the evening <lb/>sederunt the following motion, by Dr Gardner, was una<lb break="no"/>nimously agreed to–That the Commission having con<lb break="no"/>sidered the evidence on the record, find, that in as far <lb/>as that evidence is hearsay, it is inadmissable; but find <lb/>it proved that on the afternoon of Friday the 25th of <lb/>May last, Mr M'Lean was seen in a state of intoxication <lb/>in the vestibule of the General Assembly, attempting <lb/>to force his way into it; that it is proved he was on two <lb/>other occasions during the sitting of last Assembly in a <lb/>state of intoxication; and, therefore, they find that he <lb/>ought to be deposed from the office of the holy minis<lb break="no"/>try, and direct the Moderator accordingly to pronounce <lb/>the sentence of deposition, directing the Clerk to trans<lb break="no"/>mit an extract of the sentence to the Presbytery of <lb/>Skye, and them to declare the parish of Small Isles <lb/>vacant.–The Moderator pronounced from the chair <lb/>the sentence os deposition.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Case of Lethendy.</hi> –In the course of the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings during the early sederunt of the Commission, the <lb/>Procurator rose and said, he might take the present <lb/>opportunity of stating to the Commission, that within <lb/>the last three or four days a petition and complaint had <lb/>been given in to the Court of Session, and appointed to <lb/>be served, at the instance of Mr Clark, presentee to the <lb/>parish of Lethendy, against the Presbytery of Dunkeld, <lb/>and Mr Kessen, whom that Presbytery had lately in<lb break="no"/>ducted into that charge, in despite of interdicts issued <lb/>by the Court of Session. He mentioned the fact to that <lb/>Commission, presuming that they would authorize him <lb/>to defend the Presbytery, who had acted under autho<lb break="no"/>rity of the Commission itself.</p>
                <p>Mr Buchanan of Glasgow, after some remarks in <lb/>commendation of the firmness of the Presbytery in carry<lb break="no"/>ing through the settlement amidst many difficulties, <lb/>moved that "The Commission sanction the Procu<lb break="no"/>rator's defending the Presbytery in the trying <lb/>circumstances in which they are placed, and resolve <lb/>that they will to the utmost of their power encourage <lb/>and support them under whatsoever difficulties they <lb/>may be subjected by their execution of the sentence <lb/>of the Commission ; and that the thanks of the Com<lb break="no"/>mission be given to the Presbytery for the decision and <lb/>temperate firmness with which they have practically <lb/>maintained the rightful authority and jurisdiction of <lb/>the Church."</p>
                <p>Dr Bryce said, he was quite unprepared for any mo<lb break="no"/>tion on this subject; but with the views which he enter<lb break="no"/>tained in regard to this case, it was impossible he could <lb/>concur in the motion proposed, and he must therefore <lb/>dissent from it.</p>
                <p>Mr James Bridges expressed great indignation against <lb/>Mr Clark for thus bidding defiance to the authority of <lb/>the Church Courts, and he proposed, that for thus <lb/>trampling on the rights and dignity of the Church, Mr <lb/>Clark should be forthwith called before the Commission <lb/>for an exemplary punishment.–Mr Dunlop suggested, <lb/>that although he concurred in feeling with Mr Bridges, <lb/>it would be premature at present to take any steps <lb/>against Mr Clark, inasmuch as there was no official <lb/>communication on the subject from the Presbytery of <lb/>Dunkeld.</p>
                <p>Mr Makgill recommended to Mr Bridges, for this <lb/>reason, not to press his motion, declaring, that as at <lb/>this time 200 years ago eight Bishops had been de<lb break="no"/>posed, he trusted the time was not far distant when Mr <lb/>Clark would receive a similar reward for his misconduct; <lb/>and Mr M. said emphatically, that whatever the Pres<lb break="no"/>bytery of Dunkeld might suffer for upholding the inde<lb break="no"/>pendence of the Church, he, as a member of Commis<lb break="no"/>sion, by whose orders they had acted, would be proud to <lb/>bear his share.</p>
                <p>Mr bridges then intimated, that he would waive <lb/>pressing his motion, and Mr Buchanan's was adopted, <lb/>Dr Bryce and Mr W. Malcolm intimating their dissent, <lb/>on the ground that it was incompetent and inexpedient <lb/>for the Commission to adopt such a resolution.</p>
                <p>

               <lb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Celebrated Assembly at Glasgow.</hi> –In the course <lb/>of the day, the Moderator suggested, that as this was <lb/>the second centenary of the great Assembly at Glas<lb break="no"/>gow, which might be considered as the founder, not <lb/>only of their ecclesiastical but of their civil liverties, <lb/>a meeting should be held, exclusively devoted to prayer <lb/>and thanksgiving to Almighty God for the benefits con<lb break="no"/>ferred on their Zion.</p>
                <p>At seven o'clock accordingly, several of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers, and a considerable number of people assembled, <lb/>when an hour was spent in devotional exercises, which <lb/>were conducted by Drs Muir, Lee, and Dickson, in <lb/>succession.</p>
                <p>The Commission adjourned to the second Tuesday in <lb/>February next.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Thursday</hi>  afternoon the splendid ship Indus, <lb/>which has been some time in the docks, sailed with a <lb/>full cargo and about sixty settlers, for Port Adelaide <lb/>and Philip, South Australia. The Indus has been <lb/>fitted up in that style of elegance and comfort, for <lb/>which the agents, Messrs Broadfoot and Son, are so <lb/>celebrated. The passengers consist of a number of <lb/>respectable individuals of various professions, the <lb/>greater bulk of whom are agricultural labourers, sent <lb/>out by Messrs Adamson and Co., agents for her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's Commissioners in South Australia.</p>
                <p>On Wednesday forenoon a man fell from the deck <lb/>of the Royal William steam-ship, and had his thigh<lb break="no"/>bone broken, and was otherwise seriously bruised. <lb/>He was carried to the Dispensary Rooms, but upon <lb/>examining the nature of his injuries, the medical at<lb break="no"/>tendants recommended his removal to the Edinburgh <lb/>Royal Infirmary.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Afflicting Case of Destitution.</hi> –Some <lb/>time ago a vessel was advertised to sail from this port <lb/>for Australia, and to take out Government settlers free <lb/>of expense. A family in Shetland, consisting of the <lb/>husband, wife, and six of a young family, sold off their <lb/>effects and came to Leith for the purpose of availing <lb/>themselves of this opportunity to settle in the above <lb/>colony. On applying to the agent, however, they were <lb/>informed that they did not come under the description <lb/>of persons wanted. Since, therefore, they have <lb/>lived in Leith till their little all has been exhausted, <lb/>and the husband, from the combined effects of disap<lb break="no"/>pointment and want, has been thrown upon a sick-bed, <lb/>and the whole family are literally in a state of starvation. <lb/>Several private individuals, with a benevolence that <lb/>does them the highest credit, have temporarily sup<lb break="no"/>plied their wants ; but the hands of private charity is <lb/>soon crippled, and unless something else be immedi<lb break="no"/>ately done, we may have soon to report one or more of <lb/>their deaths from the actual want of the necessaries of <lb/>life. The object of the present notice therefore is to <lb/>draw forth the sympathies of the charitable, to relive a <lb/>family thus suddenly involved in want and misery, who, <lb/>from their industrious habits and every way excellent <lb/>characters, left their native home with the good wishes <lb/>of all their friends. Any donations, either in money <lb/>or clothes, will be thankfully received by Mr Andrew <lb/>Spence, of the firm of Messrs Cunninham &amp; Spence, <lb/>No. 62, Tolbooth-wynd, Leith.</p>

               <lb/>?It will gratify the admirers of the Duke of Welling<lb break="no"/>ton to learn, that the Directors of the New Zealand <lb/>Company have resolved that the name of the city <lb/>founded by Colonel Wakefield, Lambton Harbour, <lb/>Port Nicholson, and which is destined to become the <lb/>capital of New Zealand, shall be named "The City <lb/>of Wellington," in honour of the illustrious Duke. <lb/>The Duke is a great advocate for colonization, and to <lb/>him the promoters of colonization of South Aus<lb break="no"/>tralia were in a great measure indebted for securing <lb/>the enactment of the statute which gave effect to the <lb/>principles on which that colony is founded ; and, as many <lb/>of the promoters of South Australian emigration are Di<lb break="no"/>rectors of the New Zealand Company, they have re<lb break="no"/>solved, setting all party politics aside, to confer this ho<lb break="no"/>nour on the Duke. There could be no stronger proof of <lb/>the political sagacity and statesmanlike views of the <lb/>Duke, than his approval of the Wakefield system <lb/>of colonization, and no better mode of perpetuating <lb/>his name than by bestowing it on the metropolis of the <lb/>"Great Britain of the Southern Hemisphere."</p>

                <p>Narrative of a Whaling Voyage Round <lb/>The Globe &amp;c. &amp;c By Frederick Debell <lb/>Bennett, Esq., F.R.G.S. 2 vols. London: <lb/>Richard Bentley.</p>
                <p>We have been somewhat disappointed in these <lb/>volumes. We expected to have found them, like <lb/>Scoresby's, full of interesting details regarding <lb/>whale fishing, whereas, there is hardly a word on <lb/>the subject throughout the whole of the first vo<lb break="no"/>lume, and very little in the second ; in fact, what <lb/>there is, is confined to a sort of supplementary ap<lb break="no"/>pendix. This is the more strange, that one of the <lb/>chief purposes of the author, as he himself informs <lb/>us, in undertaking this voyage, was to investigate <lb/>the anatomy and habits of southern whales, and <lb/>the mode of conducting the sperm whale fishery, <lb/>subjects which, he remarks, were then untouched <lb/>by the literature of any country. Yet, in the <lb/>work itself, this chief purpose dwindles into one <lb/>of very secondary prominence. This, the readers <lb/>of the work, at least most of them, will the more <lb/>regret, on finding how very curious and interest<lb break="no"/>ing are the two or three chapters which the author <lb/>has given on the subject of South Sea whaling. <lb/>There are full of entertaining details of both a <lb/>popular and scientific character, and cannot be <lb/>read without exciting a wish that larger portion <lb/>of the work had been composed of such material.</p>
                <p>In making these remarks, however, we are far <lb/>from intending to depreciate the sort of informa<lb break="no"/>tion, in the shape chiefly of sketches of the South <lb/>Sea Islands, to which the greater part of the vo<lb break="no"/>lumes are devoted ; we mean merely to say, that <lb/>it is not what we expected from the title of the <lb/>work, nor, we may add, what, for our own reading, <lb/>we should have preferred. Yet are these sketches <lb/>very amusing reading–full of graphic descriptions <lb/>and curious details of native character, which is <lb/>still found in the South Sea Islands in a state of <lb/>very primitive simplicity. "We have frequently <lb/>seen," says Mr Bennett, " amongst the congrega<lb break="no"/>gation assembled at Church (in Raiatea), a native <lb/>clothed in nothing but a shirt ; another with a <lb/>beaver hat surmounting a person naked except <lb/>the scanty maro ; and a third, whose whole attire <lb/>was a black coat, white neckerchief, and a shirt!"</p>
                <p>We observe a rather odd circumstance noted <lb/>by Mr Bennett. He says that the " temperate <lb/>ships" of America are the principal purveyors of <lb/>ardent spirits to the natives of the South Sea <lb/>Islands, carrying large quantities of rum thither <lb/>for the purposes of traffic! This is placing the <lb/>temperance principle in a somewhat curious pre<lb break="no"/>dicament.</p>
                <p>Another remark of the author's not less strik<lb break="no"/>ing–mark it well and take comfort from it ye <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">bon vivants[?]</hi>  of the civilzed world–is, that disease <lb/>is as abundant amongst the native islanders as <lb/>amongst the most refined of their species, and from <lb/>this concludes, that man in his savage state is as <lb/>liable to the " ills that flesh is heir to," as in his <lb/>civilised condition. Dr Johnson made a similar <lb/>remark regarding the Highlanders of Scotland ; <lb/>alleging that the London alderman lived as long <lb/>over his turtle feast, as the Highlander over his <lb/>paten cake. What degree of fellow-feeling with <lb/>civic dignitary and his good living, or whether <lb/>any, dictated this remark of the learned doctor, <lb/>we cannot say.</p>
                <p>Mr Bennett's work is written with great ability, <lb/>and in style whose only fault is exhibited in a <lb/>tendency, occasionally, to the use of rather learned <lb/>phraseology.</p>
                <p>We conclude with an extract from that portion <lb/>of the work which, from its great interest, we <lb/>regretted was not larger, but which, limited <lb/>as it is, is so full of curious information, and so <lb/>crowded with remarkable incident, as to render <lb/>the selection by no means an easy task.</p>
                <p>"Some sperm whales appear reluctant to employ <lb/>their tail when attacked, but prove active and danger<lb break="no"/>ous with their jaws. Such individuals often rather seek <lb/>than avoid the attacking boats, and, rushing upon them <lb/>with open mouth, employ every possible art to crush <lb/>them with their teeth, and, if successful, will sometimes <lb/>continue in their neighbourhood, biting the wreck and <lb/>oars into small fragments. When thus threatening a <lb/>boat, the whale usually turns and swings upon its back, <lb/>and will sometimes act in a very sluggish and unac<lb break="no"/>countable manner, keeping its formidable lower jaw <lb/>suspended for some moments over the boat, in a threat<lb break="no"/>ening attitude, but ultimately rolling to one side, and <lb/>closing its mouth harmlessly ; nor is it rare to observe <lb/>this whale, when pursued and attacked, retain[?] its mouth <lb/>in an expanded state for some minutes together. Such <lb/>threatening demonstrations of the jaw, as well as some <lb/>others with the flukes, occasionally compel a boat's <lb/>crew to leap into the water, and support themselves <lb/>by swimming or clinging to oars until the danger has <lb/>passed.</p>
                <p>"In the year 1835, the ship Pusie Hall encountered <lb/>a fighting whale, which after injuring and driving off <lb/>her four boats, pursued them to the ship, and withstood <lb/>for some time the lances hurled at it, by the crew, from <lb/>the bows of the vessel, before in could be induced to <lb/>retire ; in this affair a youth in one of the boats was <lb/>destroyed by a blow from the whale, and one of the <lb/>officers was severely lacerated by coming in contact <lb/>with the animal's jaw.</p>
                <p>"A highly tragical instances of the power and fero<lb break="no"/>city occasionally displayed by the sperm whale, is re<lb break="no"/>corded in the fate of the American South-Seaman <lb/>Essex, Captain G. Pollard. This vessel, when cruis<lb break="no"/>ing in the Pacific Ocean, in the year 1820, was wrecked <lb/>by a whale under the following extraordinary circum<lb break="no"/>stances. The boats had been lowered in pursuit of a <lb/>school of whales, and the ship was attending them to <lb/>windward. The master and second mate were engaged <lb/>with whales they had harpooned, in the midst of the <lb/>school, and the chief mate had returned on board to <lb/>equip a spare boat, in lieu of his own, which had been <lb/>broken and rendered unserviceable. While the crew <lb/>were thus occupied, the look-out at the masthead re<lb break="no"/>ported that a large whale was coming rapidly down <lb/>upon the ship, the mate hastened his task, in the <lb/>hope that he might be ready in time to attack it.</p>
                <p>"The Cachalot, which was of the largest size, con<lb break="no"/>sequently a male, and probably the guardian of the <lb/>school, in the meanwhile approached the ship so closely, <lb/>that the although the helm was put up to avoid the con<lb break="no"/>tact, he struck her a severe blow, which broke off a <lb/>portion of her keel. The enraged animal was then ob<lb break="no"/>served to retire to some distance, and again rush upon <lb/>the ship with extreme velocity. His enormous head <lb/>struck the starboard bow, beating in a corresponding <lb/>portion of the planks, and the people on board had <lb/>barely time to take to their boats, before the ship filled <lb/>with water and fell over on her side. She did not sink, <lb/>however, for some hours ; and the crew in the boats <lb/>continued near the wreck until they had obtained a <lb/>small supply of provisions, when they shaped a course <lb/>for land ; but here, it is to be regretted, they made a <lb/>fatal error. At the time the accident happened they <lb/>were cruising on the Equator, in the longitude of about <lb/>118[?] degrees West, with the Marquesan and Society <lb/>Islands on their lee, and might have sailed in their <lb/>boats to either of those groups in a comparatively short <lb/>time. Under an erroneous impression, however, that <lb/>all those lands were inhabited by an inhospitable race <lb/>of people, they preferred pulling to windward for the <lb/>coast of Peru, and in the attempt were exposed for a <lb/>lengthened period in extreme privations."</p>
                <p>A few Cachalots have been noted individually as <lb/>animals dangerous to attack. One was thus distin<lb break="no"/>guished on the cruising ground off the coast of New <lb/>Zealand, and was long know to whalers by the name <lb/>of 'New Zealand Tom.' He is said to have been of <lb/>great size, conspicuously distinguished by a white <lb/>hump ; and famous for the havoc he had made amongst <lb/>the boats and gear of ships attempting his destruction. <lb/>A second example, of cimilar celebrity, was known to <lb/>whalers in the Straits of Timor. He had so often <lb/>succeeded in repelling the attacks of his foes as to be <lb/>considered invincible, but was at length despatched by <lb/>a whaler, who, forewarned of his combative temper, <lb/>adopted the expedient of floating a cask on the sea, to <lb/>withdraw his attention from the boats ; but notwith<lb break="no"/>standing this <hi rend="italic">ruse</hi>  the animal was not destroyed with<lb break="no"/>out much hard fighting, nor until the bow of one of <lb/>the boats had been nipped off by his jaws."</p>

                <p>On Monday night a public meeting, chiefly com<lb break="no"/>posed of the working classes, was held in the Justi<lb break="no"/>ciary Court Hall, Glasgow, for the purpose of memo<lb break="no"/>rializing Lord John Russell in favour of obtaining <lb/>the Lord Provost in the chair. The hall was crowded <lb/>to excess, and it was perfectly evident from the first that <lb/>the Chartists had mustered in great strength to carry <lb/>out their usual course of obstruction to the particular <lb/>business of the evening.–Mr T. Gillespie proposed a <lb/>resolution in favour of emigration to New Zealand <lb/>through the medium of funds raised by the sale of <lb/>lands in the colony, and addressed the meeting at <lb/>some length in support of the resolution.–Mr R. Malcolm, jun. <lb/>a young lad, and a Chartist spouter, after a long <lb/>speech, proposed an amendment; to the effect that <lb/>while the meeting was favourable to emigration to New <lb/>Zealand, or any other part of the world, by those so <lb/>disposed, they objected to any application being <lb/>made for a grant of public money for any such pur<lb break="no"/>pose–that they were opposed to the question of emi<lb break="no"/>gration being allowed to occupy public attention, &amp;c. <lb/>and concluded with the statement that emigration <lb/>would not afford even temporary relief to the oppressed <lb/>operatives, and that bad laws were the chief cause of <lb/>all their present sufferings, &amp;c. This amendment <lb/>which was supported by the most trifling arguments <lb/>we ever heard brought forward in public, was of <lb/>course loudly cheered by the Chartists. The Lord <lb/>Provost repeatedly explained that he had agreed to <lb/>take the chair on the understanding that the subject <lb/>of emigration to New Zealand was to occupy the atten<lb break="no"/>tion ; but here a matter, perfectly foreign to the busi<lb break="no"/>ness for which they were convened, was introduced by <lb/>way of amendment ; there was an attack made upon <lb/>the general policy of the country–and he had posi<lb break="no"/>tively to state that, if such an amendment was carried, <lb/>he would not remain in the chair. This was received <lb/>by cries for "a new chairman" and much confusion, <lb/>one party cheering, and the other hissing and yelling <lb/>alternately during the greater part of the evening. A <lb/>discussion followed, in which a boy named Jack took <lb/>a prominent part ; and it became perfectly evident that <lb/>the Chartist speakers were woefully ignorant of the <lb/>subject they had the impudence to discuss. It was <lb/>gravely and indignantly averred, that by going to New <lb/>Zealand, the working men would incur the risk of <lb/>being swallowed by cannibals! Till informed of the <lb/>contrary, the Chartists seemed to think that the means <lb/>of emigration were to be supplied from the public ex<lb break="no"/>chequer ; and when told that the funds were to be <lb/>raised by the sale of lands in New Zealand, one of <lb/>them sagely observed that it would be much more <lb/>humane and just to appropriate the proceeds of those <lb/>sales of land to employ it in sending out emigrants ! <lb/>Another favourite argument was, that every person <lb/>had a right to subsist in the land that gave him <lb/>birth, and that it was barbarous and cruel to send <lb/>a man, however wretched, out of his native <lb/>country ; also, that emigration would produce no <lb/>benefit to society at home, as the places of those <lb/>sent off would soon be filled by others. Of <lb/>course, if these arguments had always been held <lb/>good, and acted upon, the whole human family would, <lb/>to this day, have been crowded together in the cradle <lb/>of our race in the East, provided only the thing had <lb/>been possible; the extension of mankind to other parts <lb/>of the world must have been wicked, and cruel, and <lb/>useless–for "for every inhabitant of a country is entitled <lb/>to a subsistence in the land that gave him birth," and, <lb/>on his removal to another land, his place would just be <lb/>filled by others ! The above is a mere specimen of <lb/>the worse than childish arguments used by the Chartist <lb/>spouters, and which the men who are now " knocking <lb/>loudly at the door of the constitution for admission," <lb/>cheered as if they had been fraught with the choicest <lb/>wisdom !–Mr John Crawford, Secretary to the New <lb/>Zealand Land Company, endeavoured, by some sensible <lb/>remarks, to place the question of emigration to New <lb/>Zealand on its proper footing ; but in vain ; they were <lb/>determined to have the charter only–and till then <lb/>starving workmen, willing, but unable, to emigrate, <lb/>must starve on. On a division, the amendment pro<lb break="no"/>posed by Mr Malcolm was carried by a large majority, <lb/>and, after a vote of thanks had been given to the Lord <lb/>Provost, the meeting broke up. This was not done, <lb/>however, till the Chartists were called upon to be at <lb/>their posts at the meeting to be held to-day to address <lb/>the Queen–to render themselves, of course, a little <lb/>more odious by another stretch of their obstructive <lb/>power–if they can.</p>

               <pb/>On Monday a discussion of some interest took <lb/>place in the House of Commons relative to the <lb/>affairs of South Australia. Owing to certain de<lb break="no"/>fects in its government, that colony has fallen <lb/>into a state of financial embarassment requiring <lb/>immediate relief. Lord John Russell traced the <lb/>history of the settlement from its foundation, and <lb/>stated that, while its revenue does not exceed <lb/>t20,000 its expenditure has increased to the <lb/>enormous sum of t130,000 a year ! At present <lb/>its affairs are managed by commissioners, the re<lb break="no"/>sponsible Ministers of the Crown having no di<lb break="no"/>rect control over its expenditure. This is mani<lb break="no"/>festly an evil, and must form the subject of future <lb/>legislation, but in the meantime it is necessary to <lb/>provide for the payment of certain bills now <lb/>over-due. Accordingly, Lord John Russell pro<lb break="no"/>posed that her Majesty should be authorized to <lb/>guarantee a loan of t210,000 for this purpose. <lb/>Lord Stanley concurred generally in the views of <lb/>the noble Secretary for the Colonies, but though <lb/>that the Government ought not to demand a <lb/>loan until they had brought in a bill to explain <lb/>distinctly the principles on which they proposed <lb/>that the colony should henceforth be governed. <lb/>Sir Robert Peel suggested that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should ask a vote of credit for the sum re<lb break="no"/>quired, which, as it met the urgency of the case, <lb/>was ultimately agreed upon, and the subject was <lb/>deferred till Friday.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Grote</hi>  rose to move a series of resolutions in con<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>demnation of the application of a part of the Land and Emi<lb break="no"/>gration Fund of New South Wales to the maintenance of <lb/>gaols and police in that colony. It was in 1831 that this ex<lb break="no"/>pense, antecedently borne by the Home Government, was <lb/>for the first time thrown upon the colony, whose revenues <lb/>were then found to yield considerable surplus of revenue <lb/>beyond expenditure. The charge so imposed at that time was <lb/>calculated to be about t25,000 a year ; and had that been all <lb/>the colony would have borne it without a murmur; but in <lb/>fact it had ever since averaged nearly t60,000. It was not <lb/>reasonable to impose such a charge on the colony, on account <lb/>of gaols and police, constituted not the ordinary uses of <lb/>a colonial society, but for the peculiar purposes of our trans<lb break="no"/>portation system. The argument urged by the Home Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was, that the expense was chiefly caused by the extensive <lb/>distribution of convicts by assignment throughout the colony, <lb/>whose settlers drew a proportional profit from the labour so <lb/>assigned. But that assignment was a gain, not more to the <lb/>colonists, who obtained the labour, than to the mother country, <lb/>which saved the expense of maintaing the labourers. What<lb break="no"/>ever value the mother country might be entitled to claim <lb/>for the labour of the convicts, ought in strictness to fall, not <lb/>on the colony at large, but on the individual employers; and <lb/>if there were valid reasons against an exaction of premium <lb/>from them, still it was unjust to throw the obligation upon <lb/>the colony at large. That was to pay private wages out of <lb/>public rates. This one charge on the oclony was sufficient <lb/>on account for all that embarassment in its finances which <lb/>had been growing for the last six years. It had been enabled <lb/>to defray the impact, only by resorting to the emigra<lb break="no"/>tion fund, and thus checking emigration itself. No <lb/>less than t260,000 had been abstracted from that fund to <lb/>meet these costs of jails and police. The diversion of that <lb/>fund from emigration was a great evil, both to the colony, <lb/>where labour is so pressingly needed, and to the poor of this <lb/>country, to whom that refuge is so material. He considered <lb/>the emigration fund as held by the Government in trust for <lb/>the united intersts of the colony and of the mother country. <lb/>The great extent of sales of land in the colony had been <lb/>[?] owing to the belief of the colonists that the proceed<lb break="no"/>[?] would be applied to emigration.</p>
                <p>The hon. member was proceeding to cite the opinions of <lb/>various persons in favour of this strict application, when a mo<lb break="no"/>tion was made to count the House, and it adjourned for want <lb/>of its quorum[?] of 40 members.</p>

            </head>
                <p>We have received a copy of a Series of Resolu<lb break="no"/>tions passed, on the 23d of October 1840, by the <lb/>Legislative Council of New South Wales, on the <lb/>subject of immigration into colony. The <lb/>object of these resolutions is to encourage emigra<lb break="no"/>tion from the mother country, by showing the <lb/>demand for labour in New South Wales, and the <lb/>advantages offered to the immigrant. We have <lb/>only room for a few of the more important resolu<lb break="no"/>tions :</p>
                <p>Resolved. That there exists throughout the colony <lb/>an urgent and increasing want of working hands, in <lb/>every branch of industry ; that there is ample employ<lb break="no"/>ment for emigrants, at highly renumerating wages <lb/>without the interruption, in this mild climate, experi<lb break="no"/>enced in colder countries during the winter months ; <lb/>and that, even during the worst period of the past <lb/>severe drought, no persons able and willing to work <lb/>found any difficult in procuring advantageous employ<lb break="no"/>ment.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That, in the opinion of this Council, there <lb/>can be no more advantageous field for the employment <lb/>of industry than is presented in New South Wales– <lb/>experience proving, that able-bodied, sober, indus<lb break="no"/>trious and careful emigrants may, within a few years <lb/>after their arrival, rise form the condition of labourers <lb/>to be themselves employers of labour; by which pro<lb break="no"/>cess, and by the progressive increase of the flocks and <lb/>herds of the colony, a constant demand for additional <lb/>labourers is created, sufficient to remove all apprehen<lb break="no"/>sion of a dearth of employment for as many as may <lb/>arise.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That this Council would particularly in<lb break="no"/>stance the large and increasing sums at the credit of <lb/>the working classes in the Savings Bank of New South <lb/>Wales, as affording gratifying evidence of their pros<lb break="no"/>perous condition, the deposits having increased from <lb/>t24,469, the amount on 31st December 1835, to t127,000 <lb/>on 31st August 1840.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That great additional advantage must <lb/>accrue to the mother country from the large consump<lb break="no"/>tion in this colony of British produce and manufac<lb break="no"/>tures, the declared value of which, from 1826 to 1839, <lb/>according to the official returns for that period, <lb/>amounted to more than eight millions sterling, having <lb/>progressively increased from t280,000, the amount in <lb/>1826, to t1,251,969 in 1839 ; whilst the exports from <lb/>the colony, including the produce of the fisheries, in<lb break="no"/>creased from t106,600 in the former year, to t948,776 <lb/>in the latter–the total amount being t6,187,530 for the <lb/>whole period.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That the trade between the mother coun<lb break="no"/>try and this colony, together with the whale fisheries <lb/>in the adjourning seas, also affords a valuable nursery <lb/>for seamen, important in this respect, in proportion to <lb/>the distance from Great Britain, and calculated to <lb/>strengthen and secure her maritime power ; and that <lb/>this field for the employment of British shipping must <lb/>increase with the growing prosperity of the colony– <lb/>considerations which appear to this Council to consti<lb break="no"/>tute a strong additional claim, on the part of the colony, <lb/>to the fostering care of the British Government.</p>

The arrangements for the comfort <lb/>of the emigrants on board were certainly very com<lb break="no"/>plete ; and it must be gratifying to know that those <lb/>persons sent out by the company will be provided <lb/>with a large proportion of their provisions fresh, a <lb/>great quantity of patent preserved provisions being <lb/>shipped for that purpose on board the Tyne. There <lb/>are a greater number of children than usual in the <lb/>Emigration Depot–many of the families consisting of <lb/>from eight to twelve individuals.

The Directors of the Company and <lb/>several hundred persons of rank and wealth met there <lb/>to bid farewell to the enterprising emigrants, who ap<lb break="no"/>peared highly delighted with the honour extended to <lb/>them, and in high spirits with the anticipations of the <lb/>successful result of their mission. After viewing the <lb/>arrangeents made for the comfort of all on board, <lb/>the Directors returned to the West India Dock Tavern, <lb/>where a sumptuous breakfast was provided in the large <lb/>room. The Duke of Sussex took the chair, and was <lb/>supported on the right by the Earl of Devon, and on <lb/>the left by Jos. Somes, Esq., the Governor of the Com<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>pany. Among the guests were the Duchess of Inver<lb break="no"/>ness, the Duke and Duchess of Somerset, Lords Cot<lb break="no"/>tenham, Sandon, Marcus Hill, Clements, Viscount <lb/>Ebrington, M.P., the Hon. Frederick Dundas, Hon. <lb/>Captain Drummon, Messrs P. Maxwell Stewart, M.P., <lb/>Gowen, G. F. Young, W. C. Young, and the Misses <lb/>Young; the Hon. Mrs Douglas, the Hon. Miss Petre, <lb/>Rev, Dr Hinds, J. E. Boulcott, Captain Hine, Sir Ro<lb break="no"/>bert and Lady Harland, Sir John Doxatt, M. D.; Mr, <lb/>Mrs, and Miss Pennington; Lieutenant Lean, her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's Emigration Agent; MEssrs Jordan, E. G. Wake<lb break="no"/>field, Dudley Costello, Mr and Mrs S. C. Brees, Captain <lb/>Sinclair, R.N.,&amp;c. &amp;c. The rapid progress which the <lb/>grand undertaking of colonizing New Zealand has <lb/>made, was more than once alluded to by his Royal <lb/>Highness and other distinguished speakers on both <lb/>sides of politics, and its many advantages were dwelt <lb/>upon with much sincerity of feeling. Several gentle<lb break="no"/>men of the first families go out with this expedition, <lb/>which will be closely followed by several first-rate <lb/>ships.</p>

            </p>
                <p>A Return, just published, shows that emigra<lb break="no"/>tion is still proceeding upon a gigantic scale:–</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigrants from the United Kingdom in 1840. </hi>
               <lb/>England. Scotland. Ireland.

                <p>We have not the previous Returns at hand, <lb/>but we believe that a larger number of emigrants <lb/>never left the shores of the British Isles in one <lb/>year than the above. It is startling to think, <lb/>that 1800 persons quit the kingom every week <lb/>never to return. The natural increase of the <lb/>people must be about 1100 per day, of whom emi<lb break="no"/>gration carries off 250, leaving 850 to swell the <lb/>Census.</p>
                <p>The emigration to our North American colo<lb break="no"/>nies was as follows:–</p>
                <p>To Canada, 21,209 <lb/>–New Brunswick, 8,056 <lb/>– Newfoundland, 387 <lb/>–Nova Scotia, 972 <lb/>–Cape Breton, 437 <lb/>Prince Edward's Island, 1,214 <lb/>Hudson's Bay, 18 <lb/>32,293</p>
                <p>To Australia it was:– <lb/>Swan River, 224 <lb/>South Australia, 2,748 <lb/>Port Philip, 3,473 <lb/>Sydney, 7, <lb/>Van Diemen's Land, 299 <lb/>14,392</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Theatre Royal.</hi> –The Pantomine, we ob<lb break="no"/>serve, is postponed till Friday. Meanwhile, the <lb/>theatre is crowded nightly, the public being ad<lb break="no"/>mitted at second price from the commencement <lb/>of the performances.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Music Hall.</hi> –We stated, about two month <lb/>ago, that, in connection with other improvements <lb/>in the Assembly Rooms, a plan was under consi<lb break="no"/>deration for erecting a Music Hall. We are now <lb/>happy to announce, that at a meeting of the pro<lb break="no"/>prietors of the Rooms last week, full pwers were <lb/>given to the Directors to take the requisite steps <lb/>for carrying the design into execution. The de<lb break="no"/>sire so long felt by the cultivators of music here, <lb/>will soon be realisd, by the erection of a splendid <lb/>hall, constructed with a due regard to the accom<lb break="no"/>modation both of professional men and the public, <lb/>and with a minute attention to the most recent <lb/>improvements, by which full effect is secured to <lb/>musical performances when conducted on a grand <lb/>scale. By what may be called a propitious coin<lb break="no"/>cidence, Mr Bishop, the new Professor of Music, <lb/>arrived in Edinburgh on the very day when this <lb/>resolution was come to.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Martin's Paintings.</hi> –The exhibition of <lb/>these celebrated paintings in this city has already, <lb/>we believe, attracted many visitors. They are <lb/>truly wonderful creations, and possess a power <lb/>and grandeur of which the engravings, so familiar <lb/>to the public, convey but a faint conception. In <lb/>contemplating " the Deluge," the spectator is so <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>the scene, that he is apt to overlook the details; <lb/>but these will be found on inspection to be among <lb/>the most interesting features of the picture. The <lb/>groups of perishing beings are exquisitely wrought, <lb/>while everything is made to contribute to the <lb/>terrific grandeur of the catastrophe. The other <lb/>two pictures–"Pandemonium" and "the Rivers <lb/>of Bliss," are smaller in size, but equally indica<lb break="no"/>tive of the high poetic genius of the artist. No<lb break="no"/>thing could be more striking than the contrast <lb/>these pictures present to each other–the one fear<lb break="no"/>ful beyond expression, the other exhibiting a <lb/>heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the <lb/>eye rests with delight. There are several other <lb/>valuable paintings in this collection, amongst <lb/>which is "The Offering Up of Isaac," a Rem<lb break="no"/>brandt in fine preservation.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Gordon's British Diorama.</hi> –This beautiful <lb/>exhibition opened on Saturday last, and has, we <lb/>understand, been crowded with visitors ever since. <lb/>It will be seen by Mr Gordon's advertisement in <lb/>to-day's paper, that the view of the Tower of <lb/>London during the recent conflagration (to which <lb/>we alluded in our last) has now arrived, and is <lb/>being exhibited along with the other views.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Broughton-place Congregation</hi>.–We <lb/>understand that the call given by Broughton<lb break="no"/>Place Congregation to the Rev. Mr Croon, San<lb break="no"/>quhar, to be colleague to the Rev. Dr. Brown, <lb/>has not been accepted, owing to the strong claims <lb/>which the affectionate people among whom he <lb/>presently labours have to continuance of his <lb/>services, and his unfitness, as he alleges, for a <lb/>charge so laborious; a result which, we learn, has <lb/>caused among the members of Broughton-Place <lb/>extreme and general regret.</p>

                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Captain Ross' Discoveries.</hi> –Extracts from <lb/>Captain Ross' despatches have been published in <lb/>a Parliamentary paper. From the map which <lb/>accompanies the paper, we gain a more distinct <lb/>idea of his track than the previous article copied <lb/>from the <hi rend="italic">Athenean[?]</hi>  afforded. South Victoria <lb/>Land, which he discovered, extends in latitude <lb/>from 70 1/2 south to 79, how much farther is un<lb break="no"/>known; and in longitude its eastern coast lies <lb/>between 163 and 171. Its position is directly <lb/>south from New Zealand, and at the distance of <lb/>1500 geographical miles. The length of the part <lb/>seen was fully 500 miles. It was girt with a bor<lb break="no"/>der of ice many miles in breadth, which rendered <lb/>it inaccessible. The passage southward was closed <lb/>at latitude 78 by a barrier of ice 150 feet high, <lb/>which was traced for 300 miles east from Victoria <lb/>Land. Icebergs were encountered in numbers <lb/>after they passed parallel of 63, and pack ice <lb/>at 66. The land " rose in lofy peaks from 9000 <lb/>to 12,000 feet in height, perfectly covered with <lb/>eternal snow; the <hi rend="italic">glaciers</hi>  descended from <lb/>near the mountain summits, <hi rend="italic">project many miles </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">into the ocean,</hi>  and presented a perpendicular face <lb/>of lofty cliffs." They could not reach the main<lb break="no"/>land, but landed on an island, which they found <lb/>to consist of volcanic rocks. On 28th January, <lb/>in latitude 77 1/2, longitude 169 E., they discovered <lb/>a magnificent volcano, emitting smoke and flame <lb/>in a splendid profusion," and named it Mount <lb/>Erebus. An extinct one near it was named after <lb/>the other vessel, Mount Terror. At the distance <lb/>of less than half a mile from the ice cliffs which <lb/>barred their progress southward, they had sound<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ings with 318 fathoms. These cliffs, no doubt, <lb/>reached the bottom, and, including the 150 feet <lb/>above water, <hi rend="italic">must have had an elevation fo 2000 feet </hi>
               <lb/>of thereabout. The observations on the dip and <lb/>declination induced them to place the South Mag<lb break="no"/>netic Pole in latitude 76, and east longitude <lb/>153; and they considered its position as well as<lb break="no"/>certained as if they had reached it, though their <lb/>nearest approach to it was a point 160 miles from <lb/>it, on the east coast of Victoria Land. The pole <lb/>is probably within that region, though this can<lb break="no"/>not be positively affirmed, as its western boun<lb break="no"/>dary is unknown. The highest latitude they <lb/>reached 78. 4. They were therefore only 12 <lb/>degrees from the pole and about 4 degrees nearer <lb/>to it than Captain Weddel[?], the most successful <lb/>of their predecessors. <cb/>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Sabbath Observance–The Sweetie Case. </hi>
               <lb/>–We understand that the Government of Prus<lb break="no"/>sia, thinking that the mode of keeping the Sab<lb break="no"/>bath in that country was in some respects too lax, <lb/>recently sent over a person to this country, to <lb/>learn whether our practise in Britain would not <lb/>furnish hints for improvement. Unluckily, the <lb/>very first specimens of our piety which met him <lb/>were the sweetie case, and that of the poor man <lb/>Key who was excommunicated for burying his <lb/>child on Sunday. These will of course figure in <lb/>the very front of the officer's report as the na<lb break="no"/>tural fruits of our system, and we may guess <lb/>what their effect will be in reconciling the Ger<lb break="no"/>mans to a stricter observance of Sunday! We <lb/>can, moreover, inform Butters' prosecutors, that <lb/>the fame of their exploits has already travelled, by <lb/>the aid of the Teutonic newspapers, to the utter<lb break="no"/>most parts of Germany, to the infinite amusement <lb/>of the Swabian farmers, the Saxon miners, and <lb/>the shepherds of the Riesengeberge. Key's case is <lb/>no doubt destined to enjoy equal celebrity.</p>

The <lb/>evening was very clear, the sky being without a <lb/>cloud, and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly, <lb/>a dazzling blaze of light burst from the sky, illu<lb break="no"/>minating Benlomond and the distant hills, the <lb/>Curse around Craigforth, and, indeed, the earth <lb/>and air on every side as far as the eye could reach, <lb/>with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The pheno<lb break="no"/>menon appeared like a ball of fire, of an oblong <lb/>shape, and apparently almost twice the size of <lb/>the moon, having at the time somewhat of the <lb/>same silvery appearance as that luminary, but <lb/>flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to <lb/>dazzle the eyes. A tail of fire somewhat re<lb break="no"/>sembling that of a rocket, but composed of the <lb/>most beautifully varied colours, streamed behind <lb/>it for a short distance, adding much to its spen<lb break="no"/>dour, and giving the whole an appearance at once <lb/>singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it <lb/>disappeared, it assumed a red glowing appear<lb break="no"/>ance, and then burst for an instant enve<lb break="no"/>loping the earth and sky in a blaze as bright and <lb/>dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared <lb/>to pass from the south to the north, inclining to<lb break="no"/>wards the earth. To the eye it seemed to burst <lb/>and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another me<lb break="no"/>teor of the same kind, but much less in size, <lb/>brilliancy, and splendour, was observed falling in <lb/>a quartr rather farther to the south, a few mi<lb break="no"/>nutes previously. It is a coincidence worthy of <lb/>notice, that a meteor, of the same nature with <lb/>that first described in the above, was seen at the <lb/>same hour in Glasgow.– <hi rend="italic">Stirly Journal.</hi>

It is pretty generally <lb/>known that a small portion of the would-be-po<lb break="no"/>litical leaders of the town who have not the <lb/>influence to get themselves placed in municipal <lb/>authority, have for a good number of years endea<lb break="no"/>voured to embarass the party in power, by attack<lb break="no"/>ing the credit of the community. The unfavour<lb break="no"/>about state of trade and the leniency of the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil in not enforcing during the last year the ex<lb break="no"/>actions on the owners of property, for entries, &amp;c. <lb/>falling due, caused a deficiency of nearly t300 <lb/>in the usual amount of revenue. This simple <lb/>circumstance was taken advantage of, though <lb/>nothing was lost thereby, and statements prejudi<lb break="no"/>cial to the town's credit were placed in the hands <lb/>of every credito that could be found by the indi<lb break="no"/>viduals referred to, and thus uncalled for alarm <lb/>raised. In addition to this, the adherents of the <lb/>same party in the Council during the last five <lb/>days gave currency to another statement which <lb/>they knew to be quite untrue, about the late Pro<lb break="no"/>vost having commenced to secure himself by <lb/>drawing a thousand pounds, when the fact was he <lb/>had not drawn out a penny.

As regards risk to the creditors, <lb/>from the best informed quarters we are assured <lb/>there is none. More than one-third of the whole <lb/>debts of the town are due to the Bank and the <lb/>members of Council, or their immediate friends, <lb/>and fully a half of the debt against the river is due <lb/>to the same parties.

            </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Falkland Islands</hi>  have been nominally a <lb/>British colony for some years; but, in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of representations made to Government by <lb/>various persons interested in the trade to the South <lb/>Seas, a plan has at least been drawn up for esta<lb break="no"/>blishing a body of settlers in these islands. It <lb/>was submitted to the late Ministers, who referred <lb/>it to the Commissioners of Emigration and the <lb/>Lords of the Admiralty, by both of whom it was <lb/>approved. Rules were prepared by the Com<lb break="no"/>missioners of Emigration ; a vote of t3750 was <lb/>put into the estimates for the first year's ex<lb break="no"/>pense, and, we suppose, passed. If steps have <lb/>not been taken already to send out emigrants, we <lb/>presume they will be taken about the beginning <lb/>of next winter, which is their summer.</p>
                <p>These islands are about 300 miles from the <lb/>south extremity of the American continent, in a <lb/>latitude corresponding with that of London. <lb/>Their climate, however, very closely resembles <lb/>that of Shetland. They have cold summers and <lb/>mild winters. Snow seldom lies in them; but <lb/>owing to their humidity and want of sunshine, <lb/>and the stormy winds which blow almost con<lb break="no"/>stantly, wheat of barley could not be raised in <lb/>them, and even oats might turn out to be a pre<lb break="no"/>carious crop. It is doubted also if wood will <lb/>grow, and at present there is not a single tree in <lb/>the islands. Turnips and potatoes succeed well, <lb/>and there is an abundance of good grass, upon which <lb/>some thousands of black cattle, horses, and hogs, <lb/>thrive in the wild state, and sheep have been in<lb break="no"/>troduced and found to do well. Extensive peat<lb break="no"/>bogs exist, which will afford a sufficient supply of <lb/>fuel. The present population consists of twenty<lb break="no"/>five persons, young and old–one-half of them <lb/>British, the other Gauchos, South American In<lb break="no"/>dians of a semi-civilised description. They are <lb/>all stationed at Port-Louis, a fine natural har<lb break="no"/>bour, where a British officer resides.</p>
                <p>The islands are numerous, but all very small <lb/>except two, whose area is estimated at 13,000 <lb/>square miles, or nearly half the extent of Scot<lb break="no"/>land. They are deeply perforated by arms of the <lb/>sea, and probably afford a greater number of fine <lb/>natural harbours than any country of equal ex<lb break="no"/>tent in the world. Their shores afford excellent <lb/>fish of many kinds, and seals are exceedingly <lb/>numerous.</p>
                <p>The great object in establishing a colony here <lb/>is to provide a harbour of refuge and place of re<lb break="no"/>fitment for our ships frequenting the South Seas, <lb/>which are yearly increasing in number. Every <lb/>vessel going to the Pacific Ocean, or coming from <lb/>it, passes within sight of these islands, or near <lb/>them. At present 60 or 70 British ships pass <lb/>these islands annually coming from Chili or Peru, <lb/>and 20 more engaged in the whale fishery. The <lb/>trade to New South Wales employs 236 vessels, <lb/>most of which return to England by this route, <lb/>which will also be preferred by vessels trading to <lb/>New Zealand, Van Diemen's Land, Port Philip, <lb/>and probably South Australia. From Sydney or <lb/>Hort Town the distance is nearly the same by <lb/>Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope, but the <lb/>prevalence of westerly winds in the parallel be<lb break="no"/>yond the 30th, renders the latter route the more <lb/>advantageous on the outward voyage, and the <lb/>former on the return. The Falkland Islands are <lb/>about half as distant from Britain as New South <lb/>Wales.</p>
                <p>The Emigration Board recommend that Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should send out two surveyors to select an <lb/>eligible site for a town, and to lay out the land in <lb/>blocks of half a square mile, which may be subdivid<lb break="no"/>ed. It is proposed to sell the land to emigrants at <lb/>12s. per acre, and to expend part of the money in <lb/>carrying out additional settlers, part in defraying <lb/>the colonial outlay. There are 40,000 wild cattle in <lb/>the largest island, the privilege of shooting which, <lb/>or catching and taming them, might be sold to <lb/>the settlers or a company. The climate is unin<lb break="no"/>viting, but there is little doubt that persons ac<lb break="no"/>customed to grazing or sheep farming, or to seal<lb break="no"/>hunting, or deep-sea fishery, might drive a profit<lb break="no"/>able trade here. A vast number of ships, making <lb/>long voyages, American, French, Dutch, as well <lb/>as British, pass the islands, and to these it would <lb/>be a great accommodation to find supplies of pro<lb break="no"/>visions and the means of refitting here. Some of <lb/>our starving population in the North of Scotland <lb/>or the Islands, might better their circumstances <lb/>by removing to the Falkland Islands.</p>

                <p>( <hi rend="italic">From the Morning Chronicle.</hi>.</p>
                <p>The dinner given on Saturday by the New Zea<lb break="no"/>land Company to Lord John Russell will serve to re<lb break="no"/>move all apprehensions, if any are yet entertained, <lb/>with regard to the relations between that colony and <lb/>the Government of the parent state. Many of the first <lb/>names in the country honoured this splendid banquet <lb/>by their presence ; and men of all parties, Tories, <lb/>Whigs, and Radicals, appeared to be actuated only <lb/>by one common feeling.</p>
                <p>The public are now tolerably familiar with the <lb/>natural advantages of New Zealand, which appears <lb/>destined to be in the Souther Ocean what Great <lb/>Britain is in the Northern. Lord Ashburton, with <lb/>must felicity, observed, " that the position of the New <lb/>Zealand islands on the map, their climate, fertility, <lb/>abundant harbours surrounded with the seas most <lb/>suited to the whale fisheries, and, above all, the <lb/>character to the native population, led him to antici<lb break="no"/>pate that these islands were likely to become the <lb/>great seat of wealth and naval power." Lord John <lb/>Russell was justly complimented, on all hands, for <lb/>adding these important islands to the great colonial <lb/>empire of this country.</p>
                <p>The speech of Lord John Russell was much and <lb/>deservedly applauded.</p>
                <p>"I believe," said his lordship, "that the foundation <lb/>of this colony of New Zealand will tend to the honour <lb/>and dignity of the Crow, and will tend to the pros<lb break="no"/>perity and future greatness of the nation (cheers). It <lb/>was on this ground, and for these reasons, that I lent <lb/>my humble efforts in support of those exertions that <lb/>had been made, and were about to be made, by the <lb/>New Zealand Company. Gentlemen, in so doing, I <lb/>should be unworthy of your approbation if I took <lb/>any extraordinary merit to myself ; for, in the <lb/>first place, the principle of colonization, the value of <lb/>colonies to this country, the means they afford of aug<lb break="no"/>menting her strength, of adding to her power, of pro<lb break="no"/>moting her wealth, and of increasing her prosperity– <lb/>all this has been ascertained and demonstrated by the <lb/>enlightened discussions of past years (hear, hear). With <lb/>regard to the best mode of colonization, likewise, we <lb/>have had the advantage and assistance of the most en<lb break="no"/>lightened opinions, and the most adverse discussion <lb/>I, therefore, can only take to myself the merit of not <lb/>being blind to the importance and value of those opi<lb break="no"/>nions and discussions (hear, and cheers)"</p>
                <p>But though his lordship speaks thus humbly of his <lb/>own merits, in recommending the adoption of these <lb/>islands by the Crown, it was perfectly well understood <lb/>by all present that, for his conduct with respect to <lb/>his colony, he has truly entitled himself to the grati<lb break="no"/>tude of his country. Lord Ashburton only paid him <lb/>a deserved tribute when he complimented him for the <lb/>sagacity with which he had appreciated the import<lb break="no"/>ance of these islands, so soon as he had entered on the <lb/>administration of colonial affairs, and for the judicious <lb/>measure of setting up the British flag in them.</p>
                <p>We may observe that the health of her Majesty's <lb/>Ministers, proposed by Mr Hutt, M.P., was received <lb/>with loud and universal cheering, and that Mr La<lb break="no"/>bouchere's speech, which was a very good one, was <lb/>well received. Upon the whole, Lord John's visit to <lb/>the City on this occasion is calculated to gain the <lb/>Government favour among the commercial classes. <lb/>His lordship may well be proud, that though New <lb/>Zealand was formally taken possession of in the name <lb/>of the Sovereign of this country many years ago, it <lb/>was reserved for him to make it a British colony.</p>

               <pb/>There is something curious in the preference <lb/>which the emigrants from England, Scotland, and <lb/>Ireland display for different localities. The pro<lb break="no"/>portions emigrating the countries below are as <lb/>follows:–</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigrants </hi>
               <lb/>English Per cent. Scottish Per cent. Irish Per Cent. <lb/>To United States, 54, 14 1/2, 12 <lb/>– Sydney, 17, 21 1/2, 7 <lb/>– Canada, 8 1/2, 25, 50 <lb/>– Port-Philip, 8, 14, 7</p>
                <p>As the table expressly bears to be " a return of <lb/>the persons who have <hi rend="italic">emigrated</hi>," we can scarcely <lb/>suppose that it includes persons who went out to <lb/>the countries mentioned on business, without any <lb/>intention of settling. In the report for Canada, <lb/>the number who went to the United States in <lb/>1841, is stated to be only 32,500, or about two<lb break="no"/> thirds of what stands in the above table.</p>
                <p>It will be observed, that not a single emigrant <lb/>to India or Ceylon appears in the table; yet sure<lb break="no"/>ly some persons go with the express view of re<lb break="no"/>maining in these countries.</p>
                <p>The number of person who were enabled to <lb/>emigrate in 1841 by means of bounties payable in <lb/>the colonies, was, for New South Wales 22,752, <lb/>for Van Diemen's Land 331. It must be remem<lb break="no"/>bered that New South Wales includes Port<lb break="no"/>Philip.</p>
                <p>There are returns of land sold, but not in a <lb/>very perfect form. In Canada, in the year 1839, <lb/>1840, and 1841, the lands sold were 176,518 acres. <lb/>The average price was 3s. to 3s. 8d. in Lower, and <lb/>12s. to 13s. in Upper Canada; the lands granted <lb/>without sale were 194,000 acres, exclusive of those <lb/>for Lower Canada in 1841. In Nova Scotia, New <lb/>Brunswick, and Cape Breton, about 200,000 acres <lb/>have been sold at prices varying from 2s. 3d. to <lb/>3s. 8d. The lands granted are inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>At the Cape, 129,000 acres have been sold in the <lb/>three years, at prices from 2s. 5d. to 3s. 3d.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Lands sold in New South Wales </hi>
               <lb/>Acres. Average Price. <lb/>Sydney District–1839, 234,272, 8s 2 1/2d. <lb/>1840, 105,900, 18s. 8 1/2d. <lb/>1841, 15,790, 20s. 0 1/2d. <lb/>Port-Philip–1839, 38,343 36s. 6 1/2d. <lb/>1840, 83,687, 51s. 11 3/4d. <lb/>(Six months)–, 53,733, 20s. 0d. <lb/>531,930</p>
                <p>The sales were chiefly by auction.</p>
                <p>In Van Diemen's Land, the sales in 1839, 1840, <lb/>were about 130,000 acres, at 10s. or 11s.; in West<lb break="no"/>ern Australia (Swan River), in 1839, 1840, 1841, <lb/>the sales were 71,000 acres, from 6s. 1d. to 11s.; in <lb/>South Australia, 55,000 acres, at 20s. The sales <lb/>of land are no bad index of the progress of the <lb/>colonies in capital and cultivation; and, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to this criterion, it will be seen, that those <lb/>which were advancing most rapidly in the three <lb/>years, were Sydney and Port-Philip. The money <lb/>received in payment of land in these two colonies <lb/>in 1839 and 1840, amounted to t307,647; and, if <lb/>we understand the report correctly, the whole of <lb/>this sum is applicable to emigration, that is, to <lb/>defraying the expense of carrying out emigrants.</p>
                <p>The 118,592 emigrants probably carried with <lb/>them, or expended on their passage, twenty <lb/>pounds each; and thus the money which left the <lb/>country must have amounted to upwards of two <lb/>millions.</p>
                <p>This gigantic emigration one of the things <lb/>which convey an idea of the immense resources of <lb/>Britain. The United Kingdom contains only the <lb/>ninth part of the population of Europe; and we <lb/>believe it may be safely said, that all the other <lb/>eight parts do not send out half the number of <lb/>emigrants annually which are sent by the British <lb/>Isles alone.</p>

Richard Jones, Esq. <lb/>Thomas Barker, Esq. . John Lamb, Esq. <lb/>To be joined by Thomas Icely, Esq. who was a <lb/>Director here, and who is on his way to Sydney. <lb/>Solicitor–James Norton, Esq.</p>
                <p>The Company was established and incorporated <lb/>(and is now in full operation) to carry out in Aus<lb break="no"/>tralia a principle which has been acted on with great <lb/>success elsewhere, namely, that of taking up money <lb/>in this country, at a moderate rate of interest, on <lb/>the credit of a large invested capital, and laying it <lb/>out on undoubted freehold security, at a higher rate.</p>
                <p>The Company is now prepared to grant transferable <lb/>notes, under the Corporation seal, to persons desirous <lb/>of advancing Money to the Company on loan. The <lb/>notes will be for t100 each, or any larger sum desired <lb/>by the lender, and will be made payable at any period <lb/>which may be agreed upon, not being shorter than <lb/>two years. The notes will bear interest at the rate <lb/>of five per cent, per annum, payable half-yearly (on <lb/>the 15th January and 15th July), on the production <lb/>of the half-yearly vouchers, which will be annexed <lb/>to each note: these vouchers, or coupons, will render <lb/>it unnecessary for the holder of a note to present the <lb/>note itself until the principal becomes due. The <lb/>form of note has been preferred to that of bond, as <lb/>admitting of transfer without expense or trouble, <lb/>whilst it affords equal security to the holder.</p>
                <p>The Colonial Board has been established in Syd<lb break="no"/>ney, and the operation of the Company are at pre<lb break="no"/>sent confined to New South Wales.</p>
                <p>Security being the first object of the Company, all <lb/>the arrangements have been framed with the view to <lb/>attain that end.</p>
                <p>The Loans are made at a fixed interest of 10 per <lb/>cent, although the current rate is much higher. <lb/>The land mortgaged (exclusive of collateral se<lb break="no"/>curity) must not be of less value than double <lb/>the amount of the loan. <lb/>The non-payment of interest on the day it be<lb break="no"/>comes due, subjects the mortgager to 2 1/2 per <lb/>cent, additional interest for the period in ar<lb break="no"/>rear; and all parties in default for ten days <lb/>are to be proceeded against the Solicitor of <lb/>the Company "without further instructions" <lb/>and "without distinction or exception of any <lb/>person whatever." <lb/>The Colonial Board only draws on the Company, <lb/>as loans are agreed on; their bills must be ad<lb break="no"/>vertised for public competition and the pur<lb break="no"/>chasers pay the amount, in exchange for the <lb/>Bill, to the Bank of Australasia (the Capital <lb/>of which is t1,200,00) to the credit of the <lb/>Company, to be drawn out by checks of <lb/>the Colonial Board in favour of the borrow<lb break="no"/>ers as the mortgages are completed.</p>
                <p>The high character of the members of the Colonial <lb/>Board, affords the fullest assurance that these ar<lb break="no"/>rangements will be strictly adhered to in spirit as <lb/>well as in form; no difficulty has been experienced <lb/>in investing the full monthly amount sanctioned by <lb/>the instructions of the Court of Directors: indeed the <lb/>Chairman of the Colonial Board states that "he does <lb/>not entertain the smallest doubt of a safe investment <lb/>of all the funds which may be placed at the disposal <lb/>of the Colonial Board."</p>
                <p>The high rate of interest in Australia, has at<lb break="no"/>tracted much private capital from this country to be <lb/>invested in mortgages. These investments have <lb/>been made through the agency of individuals or mer<lb break="no"/>cantile firms, and therefore subject to contingencies <lb/>from which the Company is exempt. To those who <lb/>may desire to make such investments, it must be ob<lb break="no"/>vois that the stock of the Company presents a much <lb/>superior security, and the prospect of a greatly in<lb break="no"/>creased return, inasmuch as the Company derives a <lb/>large profit by lending at 10 per cent in Australia, <lb/>the money borrowed here at half that rate.</p>
                <p>It is equally clear that those who merely seek tem<lb break="no"/>porary employment for their money without becoming <lb/>shareholders, cannot have a better security than the <lb/>Promissory Notes of the Company, for the due pay<lb break="no"/>ment of which, the whole capital of the Company, <lb/>as well as the mortgages on which the money is laid <lb/>out, stand pledged. Every shareholder is required <lb/>to execute in a Deed of Covenant, by which he becomes <lb/>bound to pay to the full amount of his shares, and the <lb/>Charter supplies Creditors with the utmost facility <lb/>in enforcing demands against the Company. When <lb/>it is considered that the funds of the Company <lb/>here are kept in Government Securities and no <lb/>money lent in Australia, except on the best mort<lb break="no"/>gages on land, with collateral security in addition, <lb/>it may be fairly asserted, that in many respects the <lb/>Promissory Notes are entitled to a decided prefe<lb break="no"/>rence over mortgages in this country, which gene<lb break="no"/>rally bear one per cent. less interest than that paid <lb/>by the Company.</p>
                <p>The Charter provides that the sums borrowed <lb/>shall not exceed four times the amount of capital <lb/>paid up.</p>
                <p>That the whole capital of the Company, and all <lb/>the mortgages on which their money is lent, in Aus<lb break="no"/>tralia, shall constitute a security to the lenders of <lb/>money to the Company.</p>
                <p>That the mortgages are to be on land, with the <lb/>power of taking collateral security on stock, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>That every mortgage shall be registered–the re<lb break="no"/>gister to contain such particulars as the Governor <lb/>of the colony may deem necessary.</p>
                <p>That a copy of the register of the mortgages <lb/>shall be kept at the office of the Company, in Lon<lb break="no"/>don, for the information of the share-holders and <lb/>lenders.</p>
                <p>That an annual report be made to the Lords of the <lb/>Treasury of all sums borrowed by the Company, and <lb/>of the appropriation of them.</p>
