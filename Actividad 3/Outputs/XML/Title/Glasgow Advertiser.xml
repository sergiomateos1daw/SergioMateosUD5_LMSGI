               <pb/>Our latest accounts from the West Indies say, <lb/>that no supply from the islands, either of wheat <lb/>or flour, can possibly be obtained from the Ame<lb break="no"/>rican states in consequence of the great bounties <lb/>given by his Most Christian Majesty on these ar<lb break="no"/>ticles. Our charity, therefore, if we have any of <lb/>these articles to spare, must be first extended to <cb/>our own Colonies ; and we cannot be surprised, <lb/>particularly when we consider the present price of <lb/>bread at home, that no assistance can be given at <lb/>present, either to the French or Dutch.</p>
                <p>The crops in the island of Jamaica promise a <lb/>most plentiful harvest, except to the eastward, <lb/>which ahs generally been considered as the most <lb/>productive part.</p>
                <p>By the Westmoreland, just arrived from Ja<lb break="no"/>maica, we learn that the slaves have become mu<lb break="no"/>tinous to an alarming degree, ever since they were <lb/>made acquainted with the intended abolition of <lb/>the Slave Trade.</p>

            </p>
                <p>"We are dreadfully alarmed at present on ac<lb break="no"/>count of the great scarcity of flour throughout <lb/>the province. Common flour sold this morning <lb/>in the market at six dollars, per cwt. bran from <lb/>7s. 6d. to 6s. oats 3s. per bushel, and pease 20d. <lb/>per bushel. There has been an account taken of <lb/>the quantity of flour and wheat in this city, and <lb/>liberties, by order of the Governor and Council, <lb/>and we find there is not more than will serve as <lb/>ten days. They ar much worse off in the district <lb/>of Montreal than we are here: We have sent <lb/>them frequent supplies.</p>
                <p>"Wheat which was found too bad to be ship<lb break="no"/>ped last year at three livres, now sells at two <lb/>dollars. One Merchant will make upwards of <lb/>fifteen hundred pounds by this job.</p>
                <p>"Government, for the relief of the poor, have <lb/>caused to be issued, by the contractor here, rise <lb/>at 3 d. per lb. no one to get more than a dol<lb break="no"/>lar's worth at a time. The day before yesterday <lb/>there was delivered above a hundred pounds worth <lb/>in this way.</p>
                <p>"In consequence of letters by last Thursday's <lb/>post from Montreal, two thousand bushels of da<lb break="no"/>maged wheat were shipped yesterday for that <lb/>market. We have not had a grain of flour from <lb/>England or the States, though we hear of a car<lb break="no"/>go from New York, for Montreal. The vessel <lb/>was to call at New Brunswick ; and it is more <lb/>than probably, that people there, being in great <lb/>want themselves, have detained her. The Go<lb break="no"/>vernment have done now what they should have <lb/>done five or six months ago, and then we should <lb/>not be in this starving condition ; that is, we are <lb/>to have a proclamation to permit the importation <lb/>of grain and flour from the States.</p>
                <p>"My servant is just come home from the ba<lb break="no"/>ker's, where I had sent him for half a dollar's <lb/>worth of bread. After watching for two hours, <lb/>till the bread came out of the overn, he could get <lb/>but eighteen-pennyworth ; three small loaves, <lb/>indeed, weighing only two pounds each. Thir<lb break="no"/>ty-five shillings have been paid for ship biscuit. <lb/>The Lord knows what will become of us–ex<lb break="no"/>cept Government will distribute some of the <lb/>flour that is come for the troops, in the Queen.</p>
                <p>"Mr. Davidson, one of the Council, assured us <lb/>on Thursday last, there was not wheat and flour</p>
                <p>
               <pb/>in the country for five weeks. He has taken a <lb/>great deal of pains to be well informed on the sub<lb break="no"/>juct; and to him are we indebted for the procla<lb break="no"/>mation to allow the importation from the States. <lb/>He stood forth alone, and offered, at his own <lb/>expence, to get an account taken of the quanti<lb break="no"/>ties of wheat and flour in the town and liberties <lb/>of Quebec, and insisted on its being taken into <lb/>consideration."</p>

               <lb/>days ago two bushels of corn, which sold immed<lb break="no"/>diately at 6s. 8d. per bushel; he also brought in <lb/>360 barrels of flour, common and superfine, which <lb/>sold at eight and nine dollars per barrel. No ves<lb break="no"/>sel has arrived here with provisions since Capt. <lb/>George; and no vessel belonging to the island is <lb/>expected to relieve us. A great number of poor <lb/>people have been for ten days past obliged to live <lb/>on the greens of the field. Governor Hamilton, <lb/>by advice of his counsel, has opened the port of <lb/>Bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever, for thirty <lb/>days, to be computed from the 30th day of March, <lb/>laden with bread, corn; or flour. He also allows, <lb/>for three months, the importation of salted pro<lb break="no"/>visions from any foreign port whatever, in vessels <lb/>belonging to these islands. IT is said, what if any <lb/>foreign vessel should come here after the time per<lb break="no"/>mited by proclamation, they will be allowed to <lb/>dispose of their cargo, if they can prove they set <lb/>out with an intent to come here. If any vessels <lb/>be ready to sail from Norfolk, with provisions, ad<lb break="no"/>vise them to call at Bermuda."</p>

               <pb/>THE following extract from a late publica<lb break="no"/>tion, entitled, " A State of the present <lb/>Government of the Province of Quebec," will <lb/>give the public some idea of the Canada Bill, <lb/>which has been so much talked of an procrasti<lb break="no"/>nated so long, and at present pending in Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. The work we understand to be the pro<lb break="no"/>duction of Adam Lymburner, Esq; set over by <lb/>the province to negotiate this afair. It is re<lb break="no"/>markable,withhis former publication, for its strong <lb/>nervous elocution and perspicuity of reasoning.</p>
                <p>"Liberty is congenial to the feelings of all <lb/>mankind. The security which flows from a free <lb/>constitution, to both political and civil liberty, <lb/>contributes greatly towards bringing forth the <lb/>powers of the human mind, and the encourage<lb break="no"/>ment of the industry of people ; but no con<lb break="no"/>stitution can be called free where the people are <lb/>not allowed to participate of the legislative au<lb break="no"/>thority by their representatives : This is the great <lb/>criterion of freedom; and it is extremely natural <lb/>for all British subjects, as they know the value of <lb/>it, to struggle for such a valuable right. Great <lb/>Britain has constantly acknoledged this prin<lb break="no"/> 
               <cb/>ciple in the constitution she has granted to all her <lb/>Colonies; and by that means has rendered them <lb/>more flourishing and prosperous than those of o<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ther nations. Although the inhabitants of the <lb/>province of Quebec have, from the general ten<lb break="no"/>dency of the British government to a mild admi<lb break="no"/>nistration, enjoyed a certain degree of civil liber<lb break="no"/>ty; yet they have been, from the peculiar nature <lb/>of the system of their government, entirely de<lb break="no"/>prived of all political liberty. A more full enjoy<lb break="no"/>ment of these essential privileges has been the <lb/>prayer of their petitions, and of those now be<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>fore the House of commons. The objects prayed <lb/>for may be reduced to the following heads:–</p>
                <p>"1. An elective house of assembly or repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the people. 2. That the members <lb/>of the legislative council receive no salaries as <lb/>counsellors. 3. That the <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> act, and <lb/>the other laws of England relating to personal <lb/>liberty,be made a part of the constitution. 4. That <lb/>trial by jury in civil causes be likewise made part <lb/>of the constitution, and that nine out of twelve <lb/>may return a verdict. 5. That the ancient laws <lb/>and customs of Canada, relative to landed pro<lb break="no"/>perty, marriage settlements, inheritance, and <lb/>dowers, be continued in force in the districts or</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Curious Anecdote</hi>.–A few days ago a stranger <lb/>waited on Mr. Sibbly, Treasurer of the East <lb/>India Company, and desired to speak to him in <lb/>private ; when the were retired, the stranger <lb/>said to Mr. Sibbly, " I am lately returned from <lb/>India, I have smuggled goods to the amount of <lb/>about 120l. What duty have I to pay upon <lb/>them?" Mr. Sibbly smiled, and told him, <lb/>"That he could receive no such money without <lb/>the Chairman's permission." Pray then (said <lb/>the stranger) speak to him of it as soon as possi<lb break="no"/>ble. I am resolved to pay whatever the duty is. <lb/>The Company pays for the exclusive privilege <lb/>of bringing India goods to Europe; the man <lb/>that deprives them of any part of the advantages <lb/>they hope to reap from it, cannot, in my opinion, <lb/>look upon himself as a strictly honest man." <lb/>Since the stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly, the <lb/>Chairman had not had time to give him an an<lb break="no"/>swer ; the stranger notwithstanding, gave him a <lb/>letter, including a Bank note of 30l. The sum <lb/>Mr. Sibbly told him he should pay, if he paid <lb/>any thing.</p>

            </p>
                <p>We left Patia Dec. 15, 1789, and went to <lb/>Decca, and arrived there after a passage of 16 <lb/>days. Just as we arrived there was a famine, <lb/>and it was really a shocking sight to behold; <lb/>you could not move out of your house but the <lb/>corpses lay in your way, and the wild dogs and <lb/>jackalls were eating them at noon-day. The <lb/>Hindoos never bury their dead, but burn them <lb/>to ashes, if they can afford it; if not, throw <lb/>them into the river. I have lately seen a man <lb/>brought to the river side, and laid down at low<lb break="no"/>water mark before he was dead ; and when the <lb/>the tide flowed, it carried him off. If a man, wo<lb break="no"/>man, or child, dies at night, the corpse is eaten <lb/>by the morning. This I have been an eye wit<lb break="no"/>ness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback <lb/>every morning, I had an opportunity of seeing <lb/>more than those that did not. In the course of <lb/>six months I became so much used to it, that I <lb/>took no notice of it.</p>
                <p>"I was there when a dreadful conflagration <lb/>took place, and burnt upwards of seven miles with<lb break="no"/>out intermission, and many souls perished. Now <lb/>consider, first, an inundation; second, a famine; <lb/>and third, a conflagration. How much the place <lb/>must be distressed, I leave you to think. I left <lb/>Decca the 1st of December last, and arrived at <lb/>Calcutta, after a passage through the Sunderburns <lb/>(in 17 days), hearty and well, thank God."</p>

               <pb n="2"/>The old system of sending men of rank to go<lb break="no"/>vern Jamaica, seems to be revived, and laudably <lb/>too.</p>
                <p>This island is the most important possession we <lb/>hold in the West Indies, and is well entitled to <lb/>any mark of distinction which the parent country <lb/>can bestow upon it.</p>
                <p>The salary and emoluments annexed to the <lb/>government of Jamaica, render it the most valua<lb break="no"/>ble of any in the King's gift, except that of Ire<lb break="no"/>land.</p>
                <p>Soon after the Restoration, O'Brian, third <lb/>Earl of Inchiquin, was appointed Governor of <lb/>Jamaica, and died in his Government.</p>
                <p>Henry Bentinck, first Duke of Portland, was <lb/>made Governor of this island in the reign of <lb/>George I. His Grace died at Spanish Town, <lb/>July 4th, 1736, in the 45th year of his age.</p>
                <p>The death of these two Noblemen in their <lb/>government, gave so bad an impression of the cli<lb break="no"/>mate of Jamaica, and the insalubrity of its air, <lb/>that few persons of rank and fortune have been <lb/>ambitious of becoming governors of it, notwith <lb/>standing the brilliancy of the appointments an <lb/>nexd to the situation.</p>

                <p>"I have travelled through several of the States <lb/>and see no appearance of the poverty which you <lb/>hear so much boast of in Britain–every where I <lb/>meet rather with extravagance. Indeed they <lb/>procure too easily to be frugal in their out-givings. <lb/>All the manufactured goods imported from Eu<lb break="no"/>rope are from Britain, and they cannot have goods <lb/>equal in quality and price from any other place.</p>
                <p>"I think I never say so many children as are in <lb/>this country, every town, village, and farm-house, <lb/>are full of them.–The people of this country in<lb break="no"/>crease like rabbits: It is supposed they double <lb/>their numbers every fifteen years; but I should <lb/>think they do it in a shorter period.–What a <lb/>grand prospect for the sale of British goods, for <lb/>when so many hundreds of millions of acres of <lb/>land lye idle to be granted or purchased at a <lb/>small price, the people of this country never will <lb/>manufacture ; At present wages are high, and <lb/>1000 acres of land in the back settlements may <lb/>be purchased for as many <supplied reason="copy blur">pence</supplied>?."</p>

               <hi rend="enlarged-capital">T</hi> HAT no nation can serve the Americans <lb/>with goods equal in quality and price to <lb/>Britain, is wha the whole world knows, and from <lb/>experience the most obstinate rebel American dare <lb/>not deny: It is with pleasure, therefore, we inform <lb/>our readers, that the United States are paying <lb/>more attention to agriculture than to manufac<lb break="no"/>tures–They have already laid out four new <lb/>States since the beginning of their rebellion, viz. <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">Vermont, Kentucky, Indiana,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">The Western Ter<lb break="no"/>ritory.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wil<lb break="no"/>derness; they only began to settle it about the <lb/>year 1774. Kentucky, ten years ago lay in fo<lb break="no"/>rest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid <lb/>has been the population, that there are not less <lb/>than one hundred thousand inhabitants, already, <lb/>in each of these states. The State of Indiana <lb/>was only laid off this present year in 1789, and con<lb break="no"/>tains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From <lb/>a description of these four States, published in <lb/>America in May last, we give our readers a <lb/>short abridged description of the last of them, <lb/>called <hi rend="italic">The Western Territory</hi> ; and it must re<lb break="no"/>rejoice the heart of every Briton to read it, and <lb/>think, that the settling of these countries, though <lb/>the Americans double their numbers every 15 or <lb/>20 years, will long keep them from manufactur<lb break="no"/>ing, and is every day opening a field for new cus<lb break="no"/>tomers to Great Britain; for who will work as a <lb/>tradesman, even though wages are very high, <lb/>when he can, for twenty pounds, purchase a thou<lb break="no"/>sand acres of land, that being the present price <lb/>fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western <lb/>Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufac<lb break="no"/>tures will continually increase with the increasing <lb/>population of America.–Desponding politicians <lb/>may derive comfort from the prospect, that new <lb/>channels of commerce will be opened, and the in<lb break="no"/>land parts of the Continent will require an increas<lb break="no"/>ing supply.–British manufactures will for ages <lb/>ascend the great rivers of that Continent, and by <lb/>means of a most extraordinary inland navigation, <lb/>will be diffused through a country more fertile, <lb/>more extensive, than all the Thirteen United <lb/>States.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Western Territory</hi>
               </hi> 
               <lb/>Is the name given to this new State by Congress. <lb/>It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river <lb/>–north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania? <lb/>south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains, <lb/>according to Mr. Hutchins, Geographer General <lb/>to the Congress, 411,000 square miles, equal to <lb/>two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres, <lb/>from which he deducts forth-three millions of <lb/>acres for water; there will then remain two hun<lb break="no"/>dred and twenty millions of acres belonging to <lb/>the fed–ral government, which is to be sold for <lb/>the discharge of the debt owing to the United <lb/>States. But a very small proportion of these <cb/>lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and <lb/>disposed of by Congress*.</p>
                <p>On the lands which have been purchased by <lb/>Congress from the Indians two settlements are <lb/>already commenced–one at Marietta, the other <lb/>at Miami.</p>
                <p>This State was only laid out by Congress in <lb/>the end of the year 1787, and already contains <lb/>above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are <lb/>the Mississippi, Ohio, Muskingham, Hockhock<lb break="no"/>ing, Sioto, Miami, Wobash,&amp;c–Coal and iron <lb/>mines, and salt pits, abound in this State; the <lb/>soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined, and <lb/>may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little <lb/>or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy, pleasant, <lb/>and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth <lb/>known to the Europeans or Americans–exceed<lb break="no"/>ing the soil of any of the United States. The <lb/>timber is tall, and in great variety?Streams for <lb/>mills abound here. Wheat, indigo, hemp, and <lb/>cotton, thrive well. Many years will probably <lb/>not escape before a good part of the country will <lb/>be brought to that degree of cultivation that will <lb/>exhibit all its latent beauties, and fulfill the de<lb break="no"/>scription of travellers, who call it the <hi rend="italic">garden of </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">the world.</hi>  It is here probably also that the center <lb/>of a great empire will be fixed in some future pe<lb break="no"/>riod. It is the most centrical place for Congress <lb/>to accommodate themselves at. No country is <lb/>better stocked with wild game of every kind; <lb/>herds of deers, elks, bears, &amp;c fill the extensive <lb/>meadows of thie country?turkies, geese, swans, <lb/>and partridges, &amp;c. are innumerable. The rivers <lb/>are excellently stored with fish, and almost all na<lb break="no"/>vigable for small sloops.</p>
                <p>In the ordinance published by Congress for <lb/>the government of this territory, they are to <lb/>be allowed an Assembly when their number a<lb break="no"/>mounts to 30,000 persons; and when they ac<lb break="no"/>quire a certain degree of population they are to <lb/>have representatives in Congress; and when fifty <lb/>millions of acres are settled they are to be divided <lb/>into States.</p>
                <p>Rejoice, O Britons! that they must all be sup<lb break="no"/>plied with manufactures by you, and you <hi rend="italic">only!</hi>
            </p>
                <p>* No more than about twelve millions of acres have <lb/>yet been purchased of the poor natives, for which Con<lb break="no"/>gress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods <lb/>and rum.</p>

               <hi rend="enlarged-capital">O</hi> N Saturday last between three and four <lb/>o'clock, P. M. happened the most violent <lb/>hurricane pest, or thunder storm (for we are at <lb/>a lost to determine its proper name) that was <lb/>ever known in this borough or its vicinity. We <lb/>can conceive of nothing but an earthquake, that <lb/>could be attended with more alarming circum<lb break="no"/>stances. The cloud from the west, or rather a <lb/>number of clouds of a lowering aspect, furiously <lb/>agitated, broken, and seemingly ready to fall– <lb/>attracted the attention, and prepared the mind <lb/>in some measure for what was to follow. The <lb/>lightening appeared to those who were at a dis<lb break="no"/>tance, remarkably red, and seemed to flash from <lb/>the cloud to the earth and back again, in quick <lb/>succession or some time, as to appear one sheet <lb/>of flame. This might have had a great effect on <lb/>the air, at some miles distance from town, to set <lb/>it in rapid motion, especially when pressed down <lb/>by a heavy cloud suddenly falling towards the <lb/>earth. A very considerable quantity of hail fell; <lb/>and the rain was so abundant that it seemed as <lb/>thrown from buckets, and being carried along <lb/>and dashed against every opposing object by a <lb/>most impetuous wind, darkened the air in such a <lb/>manner, that all surrounding objects seemed lost <lb/>in night. The storm threatened to lay the whole <lb/>town in ruins, with such irresistible force did the <lb/>column of air move on: happily however, the da<lb break="no"/>mages were much less than apprehended. The <lb/>The new brick house belonging to the Rev. Dr. Da<lb break="no"/>vidson, being an an elevated spot near the west <lb/>end of the town, and lying directly in the line of <lb/>march of this powerful column, was the first suf<lb break="no"/>ferer; all the parts of the building above the square <lb/>were suddenly borne off, and a great part of the <lb/>roof was carried over Mr. Paton's house, which <lb/>stood at a small distance on the east, striking it <lb/>forcibly, and injuring it greatly in its ways, and <lb/>fell on the adjoining lot. Mr. Paton's house is <lb/>left in much the same condition as the Doctor's. <lb/>After injruing some smaller buildings in its course <lb/>to the eastward, the next elevated object to which <lb/>it pointed its fury, was the presbyterian church <lb/>in the certain of town–a building of uncom<lb break="no"/>mon solidity, calculated, it was thought, to stand <lb/>for ages, admist all the war of the elements. A<lb break="no"/>bout a fourth part, however of the roof of the <lb/>north side was carried off, with the weighty cor<lb break="no"/>nice, and thrown to the ground at some hundred <lb/>yards distance on the east side of the open square <lb/>which is in the centre of this borough. After <lb/>leaving the town it beat its course to the public <lb/>buildings, and greatly injured that range nearest <lb/>the town. Many fences in the neighbourhood, <lb/>which were in the line of its direction, were also <lb/>thrown down; but how far it extended, or what <lb/>damages the farmers may have sustained we have <lb/>not yet learned. Let it, however, not be forgot<lb break="no"/>ten, that dreadful as the scene was, through the <lb/>good providence of God, not a single life was <lb/>lost or any personal injury, worth mentioning, <cb/>received, and the buildings, it is hoped, will soon <lb/>be restored to as good a state as they were in be<lb break="no"/>fore.</p>

                <p>We are happy in informing our readers, that <lb/>in the memory of the oldest man among us a <lb/>more plentiful year has not been known than the <lb/>present. Neither mildew nor fly has affected the <lb/>wheat; the grain is heavy, and full, and in large <lb/>quantities. The other grains are likewise plen<lb break="no"/>tiful, and of an excellent quality. Such distin<lb break="no"/>guished favours call for the gratitude of the in<lb break="no"/>habitants of the United Sates, to the great Au<lb break="no"/>thor of Nature; especially when these blessings of <lb/>nature are connected in the same year with deli<lb break="no"/>verance from anarchy, and with the establishment <lb/>of a wise, free, and just government.</p>

               <pb n="2"/>We have been favoured by a friend with the <lb/>following extract of a letter from Grenada, by <lb/>the last West India Packet.</p>
                <p>"A Mr. C– has just arrive here from <lb/>Martinico, where he left the white inhabitants in <lb/>arms. The negroes there had conceived an idea, <lb/>that the Parliament of England had set the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish negroes free ; where upon those on several of <lb/>the most considerable estates assembled together <lb/>to the amount of 4000, and retired to the moun<lb break="no"/>tains, declaring, they would no longer be slaves ; <lb/>saying, that they had as good a right to be free, <lb/>as the negroes in the English islands. What has <lb/>been the event is unknown ; but some reports say <lb/>that they had arms, and had resisted the military <lb/>and the militia ; and that 400 had been taken <lb/>and condemned to die. It is a little singular that <lb/>such an alarming spirit of discontent should first <lb/>make its appearance among the French negroes, <lb/>if they are (as has been assented by several writers) <lb/>so much more civilized, so much better treated, <lb/>than those of the English islands. God knows <lb/>what bloodshed may soon follow, from the mis<lb break="no"/>taken humanity of some well meaning, but ill <lb/>informed leaders among you."</p>

                <p>"It is with great concern I communicate to <lb/>you the following truly melancholy intelligence: <lb/>–About three weeks ago, Mr. Richard Cheno<lb break="no"/>weth, had six or eight men allowed him, by the <lb/>officer of the garrison at the Falls, to guard his <lb/>exposed plantation, in Bear Crab Settlement, be<lb break="no"/>low the Falls. In the evening of their arrival, <lb/>before they had taken their station as a guard, <lb/>a number of Indians rushed into Mr. Chenoweth's <lb/>house, killed two of the soldiers, and three of Mr. <lb/>Chenoweth's children, and tomahawked and scalp<lb break="no"/>ed his wife, leaving her on the floor for dead– <lb/>Mr. Chenoweth, (who had his arm broke by the <lb/>savages) with the rest of the men, made their <lb/>escape.–There was one of Mr. Chenoweth's <lb/>children sick, in a chamber, and, it is reported, <lb/>she never heard any thing of the dreadful massacre; <lb/>but, next morning, crawling down stairs, she was <lb/>inexpressibly shocked at the sight of a beloved pa<lb break="no"/>rent almost breathless–Mr. Chenoweth returned <lb/>next day to his house, and carried his wife to a <lb/>neighbouring plantation, where they are both <lb/>likely to recover, and, what is remarkable, she <lb/>wants to return to her own house.–The savages <lb/>have been very troublesome in this neighbourhood. <lb/>–A small company are gone to White River, to <lb/>extirpate 80 or 90 Indians, who, as spies have in<lb break="no"/>formed, have upwards of 300 horses, &amp;c. at that <lb/>place."</p>

                <p>That the present Revolution in France is a con<lb break="no"/>sequence of the Revolution in America, cannot <lb/>admit of a doubt. The American Revolution o<lb break="no"/>riginated in Adams, a very insignificant Bosto<lb break="no"/>nian. Not that this Adams had the least expec<lb break="no"/>tation of American independence, when he fo<lb break="no"/>mented the opposition to the stamp-act; indeed <lb/>no human wisdom could possibly have foreseen <lb/>the subsequent folly and imprudence of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish administration and its obsequious Parliament. <lb/>An Administration so totally destitute of common <lb/>sense, so totally ignorant of every princple of <lb/>sound policy, no nation ever beheld. Adams had <lb/>the sagacity to avail himself of such despicable <cb/>policies.–Fortunately for the American cause, <lb/>the Generals that were sent from England were <lb/>of congenial abilities with the Minister, and the <lb/>Americans themselves were surprised at the faci<lb break="no"/>lity with which they acquired their independence. <lb/>–Yet all the blunders of the British administra<lb break="no"/>tion, and the miserable conduct of the British <lb/>Generals, would hardly have been sufficient to <lb/>emancipate America, notwithstanding her ex<lb break="no"/>treme weakeness, without the assistance of France; <lb/>and this assistance depended entirely on Dr. <lb/>Franklin being driven to Paris by the fatal-phi<lb break="no"/>lippic of a certain great lawyer. Such, therefore, <lb/>is the chain of concurrent circumstances that hath <lb/>overturned the French monarch. If the British <lb/>minister had possessed common sagacity–if he <lb/>could have distinguished a general from a corpo<lb break="no"/>ral; if Franklin had been treated with common <lb/>civility, America would have remained a British <lb/>colony, and France an absolute monarch, for <lb/>ages yet to come.</p>

               <pb n="6"/>Mr. Ephraim Daniel, of Baker's-row, Mile<lb break="no"/>end, received the following letter from a friend <lb/>in Holland last week:</p>
                <p>"Sir, your friend L–y, who is just come here <lb/>from the East Indies, desires me to inform you, <lb/>that your unfortunate relation who left you with <lb/>the transports for Botany Bay, was well in Fe<lb break="no"/>bruary last. He has settled at Port Jackson, and <lb/>has leave to teach the children of some of your <lb/>nation to read and write in your own way. The <lb/>place is much improved since you ahve had any <lb/>letters form it, as there was no person without a <lb/>habitation, and being in some order, when he <lb/>left it. Except wearing apparel, very little is <lb/>wanting but business ; but you may thank the <lb/>Dutch at Batavia for it, as they have brought <lb/>several useful things there. The last crops of <lb/>corn, and the garden grounds, were in very good <lb/>condition : and what makes the settlement more <lb/>convenient, one of the people who came in the <lb/>first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for use <lb/>and ornament, as the clay is equally good as that <lb/>of Delft or elsewhere. He was surprised to see <lb/>so many people without hats or shoes, and houses <lb/>without windows, and full of wicker and rush <lb/>furniture, which is used in the place of almost <lb/>every thing else. If the smiths had a plentiful <lb/>supply of coal and iron, hardly any utensils would <lb/>be wanting. Your nephew has two children, and <lb/>says all that are born there are very healthy, and <lb/>more born than are buried or executed of grown <lb/>people. The Christians Church was quite finish<lb break="no"/>ed before he came away ; and he thinks if there <lb/>were enough of your people, they might have a <lb/>place to themselves. The farthest of the lines <lb/>was seldom visited by the savages ; and it was <lb/>reported when he came away, that as soon as <lb/>more troops and a new Governor comes over, <lb/>they would go farther than ever up the country, <lb/>when some valuable discovers are expected to be <lb/>made ; they have a gum which may be used for <lb/>gum arabic, which is veyr useful. He ex<lb break="no"/>pects several of your people will go from Batavia <lb/>to settle there very soon ; and wonders a way <lb/>for sending old clothes is not yet found out. <lb/>Norfolk Island is os thinly inhabited, that it is not <lb/>worth a stranger's while to land there ; and as lit<lb break="no"/>tle is said about it there, as if it was as far off as <lb/>Europe, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

               <pb n="6"/> The West India merchants, who were in the <lb/>utmost anxiety for the arrival of the packet from <lb/>the West Indies, have been most agreebly relie<lb break="no"/>ed from their apprehensions. The account of the <lb/>insurrections in Martinique, which we received <lb/>through France, and which has been since con<lb break="no"/>firmed in the National Assembly, naturally alarm<lb break="no"/>ed them for the British islands. We are happy <lb/>to inform our readers, that the packet brings no <lb/>intelligence whatever of tumult of insurrections. <lb/>We have not heard even that the letters bring <lb/>any account of the conspiracy in Martinique ; a <lb/>circumstance which can only be accounted for by <lb/>the little communication which exists between the <lb/>islands at this season of the year."</p>

            </p>
                <p>"This day week the most diabolical design that <lb/>that ever was formed, was discovered in Martinico : It <lb/>was an insurrection of the negroes, who were that <lb/>night to have set fire to the large and beautiful <lb/>town of St. Pierre ; while the white people were <lb/>all in confusion, and striving to escape the flames, <lb/>they were to be butchered indiscriminately, man <lb/>woman, and child.–The combustibles were laid <lb/>in upwards of 100 houses, consisting of hemp dip<lb break="no"/>ped in turpentine. The plot was not discovered <lb/>till five o'clock in the evening, when a negro be<lb break="no"/>longing to an old lady, stung with remorse on <lb/>thinking that he must murder the woman who <lb/>brought him up form a child, disclosed it to her. <lb/>The Troops being thereupon assembled, 40 of the <lb/>negroes were taken, armed with a hanger and a <lb/>long knife, the insturments which were in a few <lb/>hours to have put a period to the existence of up<lb break="no"/>wards of 5000 people. All the inhabitants have <lb/>been under arms ever since, as they are afraid the <lb/>negroes will attemp to release the 40 who are in <lb/>gaol."</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">To the PRINTER</hi>.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir,</hi>
            </p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">ABOUT</hi>  two month ago I went to the coun<lb break="no"/>try to pay a visit to a friend in a remote <lb/>county; and though I am much of what may be called "a <hi rend="italic">newspaper man</hi>," I never thought of or<lb break="no"/>dering my papers to be sent down to me. To <lb/>my utter astonishment, my <hi rend="italic">rustic</hi>  landlord did <lb/>not take in own newspaper; so there was I, stuck <lb/>down, with my friend in the country–knowing <lb/>no more of what passed in town than if I had <lb/>been in <hi rend="italic">Lapland</hi>. Intending every day should be <lb/>my last, I went on without ordering your, or any <lb/>other paper, till two months had passed away, at <lb/>which period I returned to town. And there, <lb/>Sir, I was quite a new man, and just as if I had <lb/>dropped down from the clouds. Every day I <lb/>heard people talking of occurrences of which I <lb/>knew nothing : Revolutions in France by <hi rend="italic">Fish<lb break="no"/>women</hi>  ; and battles in Flanders, against the <lb/>Emperor, who I thought was fighting against <lb/>the Turks.</p>
                <p>But even this was not the most distressing–for <lb/>one day meeting a friend, I inquired very cor<lb break="no"/>dially after his wife, who I found a few days af<lb break="no"/>terwards, had eloped just before with another <lb/>gentleman ; and meeting with a lady, I inquir<lb break="no"/>ed kindly for her sister, who I found had depart<lb break="no"/>ed to the other world a fortnight before.</p>
                <p>On this account I never will stir again "out of <lb/>the world" unless your paper goes along with me. I <lb/>hold a newspaper to be a kind of <hi rend="italic">viaticum</hi>  with <lb/>which every man should be provided, and which be<lb break="no"/>come the more necessary the further we remove <lb/>from town It. is the only way to keep pace with <lb/>what is going on every day in the fashionable or <lb/>literary world–and to prevent talking about dead <lb/>friends, or wives that have absconded.</p>
                <p>In short, Sir, a newspaper is my <hi rend="italic">creed</hi> –and ne<lb break="no"/>ver will I again travel without my faith along with <lb/>me : having fully experienced the unpleasantness <lb/>of being sent back into the world as ignorant as <lb/>if I had been born again– <hi rend="italic">I hereby give notice</hi> – <lb/>"That if an <hi rend="italic">hottentot</hi>  friend of mine invites me, <lb/>who does not take in your paper or some other– <lb/>I will not visit him." <hi rend="smallcaps">DICK DESPERATE</hi>.</p>

               <hi rend="enlarged-capital">I</hi> N the United States of America there are some <lb/>Jews, and various denomications of Christians, <lb/>–as Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, <lb/>Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers, Dunkers, <lb/>Moravians, Deists, Methodists, Newlights, San<lb break="no"/>dimanians, Universalists, and Shaking Quakers; <lb/>all of whom are allowed to perform religious wor<lb break="no"/>ship accoridng to the dictates of their consciences.</p>
                <p>The Shaking Quakers are a new sects, that <lb/>sprang up about the year 1769 : an old woman <lb/>called the Elect Lady, with twelve disciples, all <lb/>of which were said to be Europeans, were the <lb/>founders of this new mode of worship ; they drew <lb/>thousands of people after them, who pretended <lb/>they were visited with power from on high to <lb/>work miracles, heal the sick, raise the dead, cast <lb/>out devils, and speak in unknown languages.</p>
                <p>This Lady risided in the north-westerly part <lb/>of the State of New York, where she began to <lb/>instil her tenets into some of the people there:– <lb/>afterwards she rambled from place to place, pro<lb break="no"/>mulgating her religion, and gaining proselytes in <lb/>New England, and elsewhere:–she engrossed the <lb/>kingdom of heaven to herself and followers, to <lb/>the seculsion of all others.</p>
                <p>She pretended her mission was immediately from <lb/>heaven;–that she travelled in pain for her elect, <lb/>–could speak in seventry-two unknown languages, <lb/>in which she conversed with those that had de<lb break="no"/>parted this life,–that there had not been a true <lb/>church upon earth since the days of the Apostles, <lb/>until her's was erected,–that both the living and <lb/>the dead must be saved, in, by, and through her <lb/>–must confess their sins unto her, and procure <lb/>her parson, or they could not be saved;–that <lb/>that she gathered her church from both earth and <lb/>hell, as every person that had died since the time <lb/>of the Apostles, until her church was set up, was <lb/>damned, and that they were ocntinually making <lb/>intercession to her for salvation, which was the <lb/>occasion of her talking to them in those unknown <lb/>tongues.</p>
                <p>Those that entered into her church were ob<lb break="no"/>liged to confess their sins, and deliver up their <lb/>jewels, rings, necklaces, buckles, watches, &amp;c. to <lb/>be disposed of as she thought fit.</p>
                <p>It has been reported that some of these confes<lb break="no"/>sions proved very beneficial; for some of her <lb/>church members owned they had stolen things that <lb/>had been laid to innocent persons.</p>
                <p>When these people carry on their worship, they <lb/>pretend to praise the Lord by singing, dancing, <lb/>jumping, turning round, falling down, tumbling, <lb/>&amp;c. and in the mean time some will be trembling, <lb/>groaning, sighing, and sobbing: whilst others are <lb/>preaching, praying, exhorting, &amp;c. others will be <lb/>clapping their hands, shouting, hallowing, scream<lb break="no"/>ing, and making such a hideous noise, that it <lb/>may be heard at a great distance, and will often <lb/>affrighten the spectators.</p>
                <p>They often dance three hours without inter<lb break="no"/>mission, and when any of them are tired of prais<lb break="no"/>ing the Lord that way, they are whipped by o<lb break="no"/>thers, to make the worship go on briskly. <cb/>They dance till they are much emaciated ; the <lb/>young women grow pale, appear like ghosts or <lb/>apparitions, or like deserters from a church-yard, <lb/>–if I may use the sailor's phrase.</p>
                <p>They make no use of the Eucharist, or of wa<lb break="no"/>ter baptism in their churchs; are averse to wars, <lb/>fighting, and swearing ; they use the plain lan<lb break="no"/>guage, and cry– <hi rend="italic">yea</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">nay</hi>, instead of <hi rend="italic">yes</hi>  and <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">no</hi> : but the other Quakers do not approve of all <lb/>their tenets.</p>
                <p>At particular times they labour very hard at <lb/>their respective occupations, and are very careful <lb/>that no time is spent in idleness.</p>
                <p>They pretend they hold a correspondence with <lb/>the saints and angels, and that they frequently <lb/>see and converse with the spirits of their departed <lb/>friends.</p>
                <p>Many of them refuse to be with their wives, <lb/>because they suppose they are part of the hundred <lb/>and forty and four thousand mentioned in the <lb/>Revelations that were redeemed from the earth, <lb/>and were not defiled with women.</p>
                <p>They hold, that they have already been made <lb/>partakers of the first resurrection, and that on <lb/>them the second death will have no power.</p>
                <p>They do not allows the instrumental music in <lb/>their churches, because they suppose it was cere<lb break="no"/>monial, and is abolished;–but pretend that they <lb/>carry on their worship by the immediate power <lb/>and influence of the Holy Ghost, and that they <lb/>have scripture warrents for their practice, a[?]– <lb/>Sing unto God,–Praise the Lord in the dance; <lb/>–O clap your hands, all ye people;–Shout on <lb/>to God;–Make a joyful noise;–Fall down be<lb break="no"/>fore the Lords,&amp;c.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Martinique</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Oct</hi>. 6.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>The disturbances in this island are so far from <lb/>having abated, that they seem daily to gain ad<lb break="no"/>ditional force. The French General, after the <lb/>and endeavoured to bring over a part of the mi<lb break="no"/>litary to his side, against the people : He began <lb/>with subalterns, several of whom took a cer<lb break="no"/>tain oath of attachment which he administered to <lb/>them ; but when he came to the Major, that of<lb break="no"/>ficer declined, saying he had already engaged <lb/>himself on the <hi rend="italic">side of the people</hi>. Incensed at this <lb/>reply, he reviled him in very opprobrious terms, <lb/>and at last laid his cane upon him !</p>
                <p>Frustrated in his attempts upon the infantry, <lb/>he made his next application to the regiment of <lb/>artillery, but with as little success. They inform<lb break="no"/>ed him, that themselves and Culverins were sta<lb break="no"/>tioned there for the protection of the <hi rend="italic">people</hi>, and <lb/>for <hi rend="italic">them</hi>  only should be used.</p>
                <p>Driven to the last shift, his distress suggested <lb/>the sorry expedient of having recourse to the <hi rend="italic">peo<lb break="no"/>ple</hi>  of <hi rend="italic">colour</hi>, who <hi rend="italic">here</hi>  form a considerable corps. <lb/>By a small dose of flattery these people, so rea<lb break="no"/>dily to be caught by a little seeming attention, <lb/>promised to stand by him ; and did so, as long <lb/>as they usually stand firm to any thing–that is, till <lb/>their fears for their own persons became an ob<lb break="no"/>ject of more weighty concern–they then aban<lb break="no"/>doned him.</p>
                <p>The humiliating familiarities to which he de<lb break="no"/>scended to this motley rabble, were truly disgust<lb break="no"/>ing. He embraced them; called them his <hi rend="italic">enfans </hi>
               <lb/>and <hi rend="italic">cher amis</hi>, and practised all the dirty conde<lb break="no"/>scensions, which those only who are conversant in <lb/>the praise-worthy art of cajoling, can form any <lb/>conception of.</p>
                <p>The effect of this conduct was, as might be ex<lb break="no"/>pected, insolence–one of this banditti presumed <lb/>to strike a grenadier–this incensed both the mi<lb break="no"/>litary and the peopl–the consequence was, their <lb/>doughty leader was laid hold of, when his trusty <lb/>defenders left him to his fate. He wa sput into <lb/>confinement, and had the pleasure of beholding <lb/>from the windows of his prison, him whom he had <lb/>inspired with the insolent temerity to strike <lb/>White, suspended on a gibbet.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of St. Pierre then assembled <lb/>to confer on the measures to be taken on this oc<lb break="no"/>casion, when ten deputies were chosen to bring <lb/>the deposed Commander to that part of the island <lb/>for trial, and twelve Judges were chosen to pre<lb break="no"/>side at that very important tribunal.</p>
                <p>Thus stood matters on Thursday last, at which <lb/>time a rumour prevailed that the Marquis de <lb/>Bouillee had suffered death by the extraordinary <lb/>and ingenious method of being put between two <lb/>planks and severed in pieces by a cross-cut saw.</p>

            </p>
                <p>"Congress is still sitting at New York, and <lb/>from the multiplicity of business before them, <lb/>there is no likelihood of the session's soon closing. <lb/>We are curious to know what foreigners will say</p>
                <p>
               <pb/>of our new commercial arrangements. Among <lb/>ourselves there is but one opinion, and that is fa<lb break="no"/>avourable. o our own vessels, a preference is <lb/>undoubtedly due; and among foreign vessels and <lb/>merchandise, there is no discrimination in our <lb/>import and tonnage acts, every nation being on <lb/>the same footing. With respect to the duties <lb/>themselves, they could not be laid lower, consi<lb break="no"/>dering the demand of supplies, which the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee appointed to give in an estimate state at <lb/>upwards of eight millions of dollars.</p>
                <p>"Accustomed to disappointment in hopes of <lb/>improvement in politics and commerce, we <lb/>feel a reluctance to entertaining very sanguine <lb/>wishes. Yet appearances encourage the expect<lb break="no"/>tion of the f–deral government's acting with the <lb/>energy and effect that will give it respectability. <lb/>The prejudices and animosities created by the <lb/>late contest are gradually dying away ; and to <lb/>the idleness and dissipation flowing from the same <lb/>source, industry has in a great degree succeeded. <lb/>A progress has also been made in manufactures <lb/>of various kinds that was not expected ; and the <lb/>persevering in them affords a strong presumption <lb/>of those concerned deriving advantage.</p>
                <p>"Throughout the union, the public opinion <lb/>on matters of government has of late experien<lb break="no"/>ced rapid changes. Vice President Adams, in <lb/>his highly esteemed work, has fully demonstrated <lb/>the absurdity of democracy, and the superior ex<lb break="no"/>cellence of a mix form, such as that of Britain. <lb/>His deductions from premises admitted as just, <lb/>have abated much of the popular aversion to mo<lb break="no"/>narchy ; and as every thing matures quickly in <lb/>our transatlantic soil, it would not surprise many, <lb/>were United America to have a sovereign ear<lb break="no"/>in the next century.</p>
                <p>"In no one instance has our new admnistra<lb break="no"/>tion given general satisfaction, more than in their <lb/>conduct towards the Indians. The interests of <lb/>those unfortunate people will be studiously attend<lb break="no"/>ed to ; and they will be effectually protected a<lb break="no"/>gainst the lawless violence of the individuals or <lb/>States, who wished to wrest their lands from them. <lb/>This determination is dictated by policy as well <lb/>humanity ; for it is now become the interest of <lb/>the States to check, by every means short of <lb/>violence, the erratic disposition of their citizens, <lb/>who, when removed to the wilds beyond the <lb/>mountains, cannot be regarded as of any value, <lb/>in a political view.</p>

               <pb/>Governor Philips describes Port Jackson, which <lb/>is only about nine miles to the Northward of <lb/>Botany Bay in South Wales, on the Coast of <lb/>Holland, as one of the finest harbours in the <lb/>world, in which 1000 sail of the line might ride <lb/>in perfect security. Sydney cove, named so in <lb/>honour of Lord Sydney, the Governor chose in <lb/>preference, which is about hal a mile in length, <lb/>and a quarter of a mile across at the entrance. <lb/>Here was the finest spring water, and ships can <lb/>anchor so close in short, that at a very small expence <lb/>quays may be constructed, at which the largest <lb/>vessels may constantly unload. His meeting with <lb/>the natives here was friendly and uninterrupted. <lb/>The appearance of the place was picturesque and <lb/>pleasing, and it afforded an ample harvest for <lb/>botanical acquisitions.</p>

               <pb/>The Minister is now said to be employed in <lb/>drawing up two plans, which will give rise to <lb/>very warm debates in Parliament : one is for set<lb break="no"/>tling a commercial arrangement between Great <lb/>Britain and Ireland ; the other for giving a con<lb break="no"/>stitution to Canada. In feeling the former, the <lb/>Minister will have to contend with strong com<lb break="no"/>mercial prejudices; in the latter, he will have to <lb/>encounter religious principles. The British <lb/>settlers in Canada are comparatively few in num<lb break="no"/>ber. The great bulk of the Canadians are the <lb/>descendants of French, and are Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lics. The former are Protestants.</p>
                <p>Fleaury in france, and Walpole in England, <lb/>were not fonder of peace than Mr. Pitt. Con<lb break="no"/>quests may be made by war, but consequence and <lb/>wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system, <lb/>if the first commercial nation in the world.</p>
                <p>Besides these considerations, the grand secret <lb/>has been discovered since the present Minister <lb/>came into power, that the best riddance England <lb/>ever had, was of her American Colonies ; because <lb/>by this means, she becomes thoroughly collected <lb/>at home, to oppose every foreign power, without <lb/>the expence and blood of supporting the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans, at the same time that they cannot do with<lb break="no"/>out BRitish manufactures in one line or another.</p>
                <p>Thus, they are under the necessity of protect<lb break="no"/>ing themselves, at the same time, that, like the <lb/>rest of Europe, they are obliged to resort to our <lb/>superior mercantile market.</p>
                <p>Application has been lately made to the Lords <lb/>of the Treasury for an order on the Bank to issue <lb/>some of the new silver coin, in aid of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent want of silver for circulation, the scarcity <lb/>of which is much felt by retail traders in par<lb break="no"/>ticular.</p>

               <pb/>Letters from Jamaica say, that by vessels arri<lb break="no"/>ved there from Hispaniola, there are advices that <lb/>the French inhabitants of that island feel, with <lb/>unabating energy, the glorious cause in which <lb/>their patriotic countrymen in Old France are em<lb break="no"/>barked. Men of every class and description wear <lb/>the national cockade of blue and white. Their <lb/>accounts from France, similar in date and sub<lb break="no"/>stance to ours, have filled them with the most <lb/>lively hopes, and animated them with a spirit of <lb/>resistance to the measures of their Government, <lb/>as forcible as it was unexpected by those entrust<lb break="no"/>ed with the executive power. At Port au Prince <lb/>both the Governor and Intendant have rendered <lb/>themselves completely odious, by vain attempts <lb/>to counteract an impulse that is irresistible. The <lb/>effigy of Mons. Marbois, the latter, has been <lb/>hung and burnt; the people loudly insist that <lb/>both shall immediately quit the colony, and their <lb/>departure is hourly expected. The press, hither<lb break="no"/>to under the severest restraint, triumphs in its free<lb break="no"/>dom; and their weekly publications give an ac<lb break="no"/>count of the proceedings of the States General <lb/>without the smallest reserve.</p>

               <pb/>The following philosophical facts lead us to <lb/>presume that the winter now setting in, will prove <lb/>a mild one : It has been constantly remarked, that <lb/>when this season commences early, and with se<lb break="no"/>verity, in Newfoundland, and the more northern <lb/>part of North America, it becomes extremely ri<lb break="no"/>gorous, and of a proportionate continuance there. <lb/>When, in the above climate, the winters have <lb/>been severe, they have invariably been mild with <lb/>us, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>. Now, the ships which sailed <lb/>from Newfoundland the beginning of October <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">last</hi>, saw the hills already covered with snow. <lb/>There is still another argument in favour of a mild <lb/>winter with us. Previously to the setting in of a <lb/>severe one, nature, in her bounty, has been always <lb/>observed to have provided an uncommon store of <lb/>wild briar fruits, as a nourishment to the smaller <lb/>birds, who would otherwise perish, a vast carpet <lb/>of snow spreading itself over the ground, so as to <lb/>prevent their coming at the worms, &amp;c. on which <lb/>they are accustomed to feed. The present sea<lb break="no"/>son, the store of these wild fruits is extremely mo<lb break="no"/>derate.</p>

               <pb/>By letters from America, dated the 5th ult. <lb/>we learn, that wheat is so great a crop all over the <lb/>Provinces, that it has fallen at Virginia to [?] a <lb/>bushel. At Philadelphia it is 7s. 6d. paper cur<lb break="no"/>rency, about 3s. 8d. Sterling per bushel;–which <lb/>has reduced the price in France in from 48s. to <lb/>42s. 2d. and it is 20s. per quarter lower in Hol<lb break="no"/>land than it was four months ago.</p>
                <p>Two ships, laden with American wheat, have <lb/>already arrived at Bristol, where the cargoes were <lb/>immediately purchased by the dealers. Large <lb/>orders are sent to America for wheat, of which <lb/>there has been a prodigious crop.</p>

                <p>"The convicts already arrived at this port <lb/>from Newfoundland, are near fourscore in num<lb break="no"/>ber; a few others are expected. These unhap<lb break="no"/>py wretches are almost destitute of every sort of <lb/>covering, and some of them are labouring under <lb/>sickness and infirmity. Their story is accurate<lb break="no"/>as follows: About the middle of last June, <lb/>this miserable class of beings, to the amount of <lb/>102 men and boys, and twelve women, all of <lb/>whom were convicts, were embarked at Dublin, <lb/>on board the Duke of Leinster transport, the <lb/>owners of which, who are Dublin merchants, <lb/>contracted with the Government of Ireland for <lb/>carrying the convicts to the North American <lb/>States.</p>
                <p>"After the ship had been at sea five weeks, <lb/>part of which was foul weather, the provision is <lb/>said to have fallen short ; the master of the trans<lb break="no"/>port, Capt. Harrison, accordingly stood in for <lb/>Newfoundland and lay-to till night; when he <lb/>disembarked at Bull's Bay, and a little distance <lb/>from it, with as much secrecy as possible, his des<lb break="no"/>perate freight.</p>
                <p>"To prevent this proceeding being too early <lb/>early known, he landed with them provision for the <lb/>immediate supply of their wants, and bore away <lb/>with a press of sail. The hungry victims lived <lb/>for three days in a state of warfare, quarrelling <lb/>about their food ; the strongest beat the weak, <lb/>and over a cask of rank butter or beef, there <lb/>was for a time as severe fighting as if a kingdom <lb/>had been at stake.</p>
                <p>"They reached the town of St. John's on <lb/>the 20th of July ; and exhibited the most appal<lb break="no"/>ing procession ever seen in that country : the in<lb break="no"/>habitants had immediate councils; and the mili<lb break="no"/>tary and navy co-operating, a place of security <lb/>was fixed upon at a distance from the town, and <lb/>they were lodged ; here under a guard.</p>
                <p>"Here the Irish howl was nightly sung in full <lb/>chorus, and the centinels were frequently fright<lb break="no"/>ed with the noise while on their posts. A battle <lb/>or two every half hour kept them festive all day; <lb/>and when the provision supplied to them by the <lb/>inhabitants was lessening, they broke away, and <lb/>laid hold of every thing that was eatable, with<lb break="no"/>out enquiring whether it had an owner.</p>
                <p>"Some of these poor wretches were anxious <lb/>to be received into the service of the inhabitants <lb/>and probably might have reformed, if so fostered. <lb/>But all of them have a claim to the charity of <lb/>this country for that supply of raiment which is <lb/>necessary to guard them against the inclement <lb/>weather."</p>

               <pb/>of the scarcity of money and general distress at <lb/>Calcutta. The multitude are out of employ, and <lb/>who cannot get into any situations by which they <lb/>might support themselves, is truly deplorable. If <lb/>a place falls vacant, a croud of necessitous candi<lb break="no"/>dates immediately urge their distresses, and it is <lb/>certainly a fact, that, for one appointment, there <lb/>are thirty Englishmen who would be happy to <lb/>obtain it, so many have gone out lately to India, <lb/>for whom there is no employment.</p>

The <lb/>Governor requested the Lieutenant Governor and <lb/>the Council, to meet the President at Cambridge <lb/>(and would have accompanied them himself hand <lb/>his health permitted) whither they were escorted <lb/>by col.

The Lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant governor and Council met him there, and <lb/>preceded the President under the escort of horse, <lb/>and introduced him to the capital of the common<lb break="no"/>wealth.</p>

                <p>The Independent Companies then escorted the <lb/>President to his residence in Court-street–fired <lb/>three vollies, and then dismissed.</p>
                <p>In the evening the several public houses in <lb/>State-street were illuminated, the Coffee House, <lb/>Bunch of Grapes, Eastern Coffee House, &amp;c. <lb/>together, which mad a beautiful appearance.</p>
                <p>Fire works were also displayed in the said street.</p>
                <p>Rockets were likewise thrown from the French <lb/>ships in the harbour, and from Castle William.</p>
                <p>Two French frigates, L'Active and Le Sensi<lb break="no"/>ble, were delightfully illuminated, the former <lb/>with several hundred lamps, judiciously arraign<lb break="no"/>

                <p>It is supposed the number assembled upon the <lb/>above occasion, amounted to 24,000 persons. <lb/>No unfavourable accident happened during the <lb/>whole scene–that we have heard of.</p>
                <p>The regularity and good order in the proces<lb break="no"/>sion afforded to the marhals the highest satisfac<lb break="no"/>tion, as well as to the numerous spectators.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">October</hi>  31. We are informed by very respec<lb break="no"/>table authority, that Mr. M'Gillvry has written <lb/>to the President of the United States, a full and <lb/>sensible account of the rise and progress of the <lb/>disputes subsisting between the Georgians; from <lb/>which statement he expected to prove, to a de<lb break="no"/>monstration, that he has not acted the inconsistent <lb/>part which some have alleged, neither has there <lb/>been such cruelties committed by the Indians.</p>
                <p>From Mr. M'Gillevry's abilities, and consi<lb break="no"/>dering he was educated in Europe, being the son <lb/>of a Scotchman and Indian women, we have no <lb/>reason to expect any savage cruelties from an of <lb/>his people; but, on the contrary, it is rather to <lb/>be presumed that his proposals, which are contain<lb break="no"/>ed in his letter to the President, are of a rational <lb/>nature, and many probably bring about a final and <lb/>an advantageous treaty with the United States.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">November</hi>  12. On Thursday last the Viscount de <lb/>Ponteves gave a surperb entertainment and ball to <lb/>a number of respectable ladies of gentleman of <lb/>this town on board l'Illustre, of seventy-four guns. <lb/>The boats of the fleet, the state yacht and barge, <lb/>received the company at Foster's wharf, before <lb/>12 o'clock–and on the appearance of the first <lb/>boat having ladies on board, a signal gun was fir<lb break="no"/>ed from l'Illustre, and in an instant the squadron <lb/>was beautifully arrayed with the flags of all na<lb break="no"/>tions. On arriving at the ship, the company <lb/>were very politely received by the Viscount, and <lb/>conducted to the state room–the marines saluting <lb/>as the company passed them. At one o'clock <lb/>the whole sat down to a table liberally spread with <lb/>a profusion of luxuries and delicacies, in a hall e<lb break="no"/>rected for the occasion, which was very fancifully <lb/>decorated. At the head of the table was a castle <lb/>of pastry, having thirteen metal guns, by which <lb/>from tubes that communicated through the table, <lb/>and the company were saluted with a f–deral dis<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>charge. On the top of the castle waved a small <lb/>white ensign–the device, <hi rend="italic">two hearts</hi> –the motto, <lb/>" <hi rend="italic">The United hearts of America and France</hi>." <lb/>The head of the hall was ornamented with a <hi rend="italic">heart </hi>
               <lb/>pieced with arrows–and in the motton, " <hi rend="italic">Ho<lb break="no"/>mage to the fair daughters of America</hi>," a fine com<lb break="no"/>pliment made by the noble Viscount to his fe<lb break="no"/>male guests. After dinner, the ball began, and <lb/>closed before nine o'clock, and on departure, his <lb/>Excellency was saluted with thirteen rockets let <lb/>off from a boat moored at some distance from the <lb/>ship.</p>
                <p>Rhode Island and North Carolina yet remain a<lb break="no"/>verse to the new government; they refuse alle<lb break="no"/>giance to all acts of the States, and, of course, do <lb/>not participate in any privilee; they are treated <lb/>in respect to port entries, &amp;c. as foreign States.</p>

               <pb n="2"/> By the last letters from India, we understand <lb/>they were going on in the plodding way, with <lb/>nothing new or important.–The markets are <lb/>overstocked with British goods, so as to enable <lb/>our countrymen to supply themselves with most <lb/>articles at a cheaper rate than if they were at <lb/>home ; the credit of the revenue rather upon the <lb/>increase ; Lord Cornwallis is as strict as ever, <lb/>who is expected to remain another year among <lb/>them, to the no small regret of those who left <lb/>England for the sake of Oriental wealth.</p>
                <p>Our <hi rend="italic">female adventurers</hi>  have also found it a bad <lb/>market ; <hi rend="italic">British beauty</hi>  never fails of finding its <lb/>admirers ; but the late restriction in the East <lb/>have rendered <hi rend="italic">wives</hi>  forbidden fruit, of which <lb/>neither <hi rend="italic">civil</hi>  nor <hi rend="italic">military</hi>  dare to think of tasting.</p>

                <p>I have always remarked that women, in all <lb/>countries, are civil, obliging, tender, and humane; <lb/>that they are ever inclined to be gay and cheer<lb break="no"/>ful, timorous and modest : and that they do not <lb/>hesitate, like men, to perform a generous action. <lb/>Not haughty, not arrogant, not supercilious, they <lb/>are full of courtesy, and fond of society ; more <lb/>liable in general to err than man, but in general <lb/>also more virtuous, and performing more good <lb/>actions than he. To a woman, whether civiliz<lb break="no"/>ed or savage, I never addressed myself in the lan<lb break="no"/>guage of decency and friendship, without receiv<lb break="no"/>ing a decent and friendly answer.

               <pb n="7"/> We have this day received Quebec newspapers <lb/>down to the 24th May, from which the following <lb/>is extracted:–</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="center">
                  <hi rend="italic">Quebec, May</hi>  20.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>We hear late accounts from Niagara mention, <lb/>that the Indians in that quarter are much alarm<lb break="no"/>ed in consequence of a message said to be received <lb/>by them from the States, that they had now rais<lb break="no"/>ed an army to take their own for Niagara, and <lb/>that two thousand men of that army were now on <lb/>their way from New York–desiring the Indians <lb/>to lye still and look on, and that they would pu<lb break="no"/>nish those that should interfere.</p>
                <p>It was also said, that the people of New York <lb/>were determined of themselves to lay open the post <lb/>of Oswego, and that emissaries had been employ<lb break="no"/>ed to persuade the Indians they would be greatly <lb/>benefited by that event.</p>
                <p>We are rather inclined to believe the Indians <lb/>are too sensible of the great benefits already con<lb break="no"/>ferred upon them by our neighbours in buying <lb/>their lands from them, to think of accepting any <lb/>more from that quarter, and we would recom<lb break="no"/>mend it to the new-born Sovereignty on this side <lb/>the Atlantic, before they testify their impatience, <lb/>that national treaties, like private agreements, are <lb/>not to be infringed by one and performed by the <lb/>other party–Pay and you shall receive.</p>
                <p>[As to the Americans making an attempt up<lb break="no"/>on Niagara, they have long had it in contempla<lb break="no"/>tion to get possession of <hi rend="italic">our posts</hi>  upon the lakes <lb/>in Canada.]</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="center">
                  <hi rend="italic">May</hi>  24.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>The concerned in the ship Columbia and sloop <lb/>Washington, have received letters from the Captain <lb/>Kendrick, dated at Nootka in July last; he in<lb break="no"/>forms them, that he passed the winter preceding <lb/>on the north-west coast of America; that he was <lb/>then bound on a voyage further northward, and <lb/>from thence intended to proceed to Canton.– <lb/>The letters were forwarded to Mexico by a Spa<lb break="no"/>nish fleet that had been at Nootka, and from thence <lb/>to the Spanish Charge des Affaires at New York. <lb/>They were covered to the President of the United <lb/>States of America.</p>
                <p>[From what appeared in our paper of Friday <lb/>last, <hi rend="italic">(see Glasgow Intelligence, p</hi>. 424 <hi rend="italic">)</hi>  and what is <lb/>mentioned above, it seems very probable that the <lb/>affair of <hi rend="italic">Nootka Sound</hi>  had been a preconcerted <lb/>scheme between the Americans and Spaniards, <lb/>as Capt. Kendrick addresses his dispatches for the <lb/>President of the States without making the least <lb/>mention (from what is made public) of any <hi rend="italic">Bri<lb break="no"/>tish ships</hi>  being then at Nootka Sound.]</p>

               <pb/>By recent letters from America we learn, that <lb/>the Congress of the nited States, after warm de<lb break="no"/>bates in both Houses, particularly in that of the <lb/>Representatives, passed an act for the purpose of <lb/>fixing permanently their seat of Government at <lb/>German Town in Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>The two new provinces in North America, <lb/>Kentucky and Vermont, whose population already <lb/>is so very considerable, were formed by the vast <lb/>numbers of inhabitants who fled from the destruc<lb break="no"/>tion and ravages of the unhappy contest between <lb/>Great Britain and her colonies, and though the <lb/>greatest part of them were then deemed loyalists, <lb/>yet they have now jooined the American confede<lb break="no"/>ration. Seated on the banks of the great river <lb/>Mississippi, far to the westward of all the other <lb/>states, they can either navigate northerly to the <lb/>lakes, or southerly to the Spanish settlements on <lb/>the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico, and carry on a <lb/>lucrative trade with the Indians. They are pos<lb break="no"/>sessed of as fertile a tract of country as any in the <lb/>world, the position of which they<supplied>???</supplied> also s<supplied>???</supplied>d <cb/>by navigable rivers to Maryland, Virginia, and <lb/>Pennsylvania, and from thence, as their views<supplied>???</supplied>
               <lb break="no"/>tend, to every country in Europe. Thus, from <lb/>the most distressed situation, to rise to opulence <lb/>and independence ina few years, must excite ad<lb break="no"/>miration.</p>
                <p>Agriculture, at present, seems to be the pecu<lb break="no"/>liar province of American industry, from whence <lb/>wealth will flow into every part of that vast coun<lb break="no"/>try, as it abounds in large tracts of rich land, <lb/>level grounds, with a deep soil, and extended sa<lb break="no"/>vannahs; while to the northward the fisheries and <lb/>shipbuilding amply compensate for the want of <lb/>an equal fertility; and though not so abundant <lb/>in coin, yet the provinces produce the finest mea<lb break="no"/>dows, form whence a provision trade will be every <lb/>year increasing. The southern countries of Eu<lb break="no"/>rope, not affording sufficient crops of grain for <lb/>the support of their inhabitants, on account of <lb/>the remarkable encrease of population, and which <lb/>is still augmenting, as arts and manufacturers are <lb/>every where extended: America may, therefore, <lb/>be deemed, in future, the granary of this quarter <lb/>of the globe.</p>

               <lb/>India Islands.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="enlarged-capital">A</hi>  Merchant, originally from London, having <lb/>acquired a great fortune in this island, con<lb break="no"/>cluded with himself he could not be happy in the <lb/>enjoyment of it, unless[?] he shared[?] it with a wo<lb break="no"/>man of merit ; and knowing none to his fancy <lb/>he resolved to write to a worthy correspondent of <lb/>his in London. He know no other [?] than <lb/>that he used in his trade ; therefore treating af<lb break="no"/>fairs of love as he did his business, after giving <lb/>his friend in a letter several comissions, and re<lb break="no"/>serving this for the last, he went on thus : <hi rend="italic">Item[?], </hi>
               <lb/>seeing that I have taken a resolution to marry, <lb/>and that I do not find a suitable match for me <lb/>here, do not fail to send me by next ship bound <lb/>hither, a young woman of the qualifications and <lb/>form following: As for a portion I demand none ; <lb/>let her be of an honest family ; between 20 and 25 <lb/>years of age ; of a middle stature, and well pro<lb break="no"/>portioned ; her face agreeable, her temper mild, <lb/>her character blameless, her heatlh good, and her <lb/>constitution strong enough to bear the change of <lb/>the climate, that there may be no occasion to <lb/>look out for a second through lack of the [?] <lb/>soon after she comes to hand ; which must be pro<lb break="no"/>vided against as much as possible, considering the <lb/>great distance and dangers of the sea. If she <lb/>arrives, and conditioned as abovesaid, with the <lb/>present letter endorsed by you, or, at least, an at<lb break="no"/>tested copy thereof, that there may be no mistake <lb/>or imposition, I hereby oblige and engage myself <lb/>satisfy the said letter, by marrying the [?] <lb/>at 15 days [?]. In witness [?] [?] I [?] <lb/>[?], [?]."</p>
                <p>The London correspondent read over and <lb/>over the odd article, which put the future [?] <lb/>on the same footing with the bales of good he <lb/>was to send to his friend ; and after adressing[?] the <lb/>prudent exactness of the naturalized Creole, and <lb/>his laconic stile, in enumerating the qualifications <lb/>he insisted on, he endeavoured to serve him <lb/>to his mind ; and after many enquiries, he judged <lb/>he had found a lady fit for his purpose, in a <lb/>young person of a reputable family, but no for<lb break="no"/>tune ; of good humour, and of a polite educa<lb break="no"/>tion ; well shaped, and more than tolerably hand<lb break="no"/>some. He made the proposal to her as his friend has <lb/>directed, and the young gentlewoman, who had <lb/>no subsistence but from a cross old aunt, who <lb/>gave her a great deal of uneasiness, accepted it. <lb/>A ship bound for the West Indies was then fitting <lb/>out at Bristol ; the gentlewoman went on board <lb/>the same, together with the bales of goods, being <lb/>well provided with all necessaries, and particularly <lb/>with a certificate in due form, and indorsed by <lb/>the correspondent. She was also included in the <lb/>invoice, the last article of which ran thus : "Item, <lb/>a maid of 21 years of age, of the quality, shape <lb/>and conditioned as per order ; as appears by the <lb/>affadavits and certificates she has to produce." <lb/>Writings, which were thought necessary to so <lb/>exact a man as the future husband, were an extract <lb/>from the parish register ; a certificate of her cha<lb break="no"/>racter, signified by the curate ; an attestation of <lb/>her neighbours, setting forth that she had for the <lb/>space of three years lived with an old aunt who was <lb/>intolerably peevish, and that she had not, during <lb/>all that time, given her said aunt, the least occasion <lb/>of complaint. And li[?]y, the goodness of her <lb/>consitution was certified after [?] by <lb/>[?] [?]. [?] [?] <lb/>departure the London correspondent sent seve<lb break="no"/>ral letters of advice by other ships to his friend, <lb/>whereby he informed him that per such a [?] <lb/>he sent him a young woman of such an age, cha<lb break="no"/>racter, and condition &amp;c. in a word, such [?] <lb/>desired to marry. The letters of advice, the <lb/>bales, and the gentlewoman came safe to the <lb/>port ; and our Creole, who happened to be one[?] <lb/>of the foremost on the pier and the lady's landing <lb/>was charmed to see a handsome person, who hav<lb break="no"/>ing heard him called by his name, told him, <lb/>"Sir, I have a bill of exchange upon you, and you <lb/>know that it is not usually for people to carry a <lb/>great deal of money about them in such a long <lb/>voyage as I have made ; I beg the favour you will <lb/>pleased to pay it." At the same time she gave <lb/>him his correspondent's letter, on the back of <lb/>which was wrote, " The bearer of this is the <lb/>spouse you ordered me to send you." Ha, [?]<lb break="no"/>[?] ! said the Creole, I never yet suffered my <lb/>bills to be protested, and I swear this shall not be <lb/>the first : I shall reckon myself the most fortunate <lb/>of all men, if you allow me to discharge it." <lb/>Yes, Sir, replied she, and the more willingly, <lb/>since I am apprized of your character. We have <lb/>several persons of honour on board, who knew <lb/>you very well, and who, during my passage <lb/>have answered all the questions I asked them con<lb break="no"/>cerning you, in so advantageous a manner, that <lb/>it has raised in me [?] for you." <lb/>This first interview was in a few days after follow<lb break="no"/>ed by the nuptials, which were very magnificent. <lb/>The new married couple are satisfied with their <lb/>happy union made by [?] of exchange, which <lb/>was the most fortunate that had happened in that <lb/>island for many years.</p>

                <p>"Our harvest is over westward and through <lb/>the southern counties of this State. This week <lb/>will finish it in the northern, and I am confident <lb/>we have not had so fine a crop since 1774, and all <lb/>gathered without a drop of rain, which will ren<lb break="no"/>der wheat fit for exportation in OCtober. The <lb/>Summer grains are also abundant, and those on <lb/>the ground, especially Indian corn, equally pro<lb break="no"/>mising.

                <p>The public debt of this country having in <lb/>course of a few days been funded, brought many <lb/>foreigners into deep speculations, which reduced <lb/>bills of exchange to par.</p>

                <p>On Monday last was married at Stockport, an <lb/>inhabitant of Macclesfield, to a female on whom <lb/>he had fixed his <hi rend="italic">affections</hi>.

               <lb/>probably being strengthened on the occasion, he <lb/>attended the happy pair to church, and saw the <lb/>marriage ceremony ; after which they spent the <lb/>evening at the bridegroom's house, where all was <lb/>gaity.

                <p>On the 18th of June, 1692, the Hon. Mr. <lb/>Boyle left by will the sum of 5400l. to be laid <lb/>out in lands in Yorkshire, out of the rents of which <lb/>the sum of 90l. was to be paid annually to the <lb/>College of William and Mary, in New England, <lb/>to be applied for the purpose of propagating the <lb/>Christian religion amongst the Indians in the back <lb/>settlements in North America ; and likewise a <lb/>further sum of 45l. to be paid to the same College, <lb/>for the support of two missionaries to preach the <lb/>gospel. The city of London were left trustees, <lb/>and the management under the trust was, by the <lb/>will, committed to the care of the Bishop of Lon<lb break="no"/>don. The present Bishop instituted this suit, in <lb/>which the city, and a great number of other per<lb break="no"/>sons, were parties, for the single, and indeed novel <lb/>purpose of knowing, whether (as the teststor had <lb/>originally devised the several sums <hi rend="italic">for the use of </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">British subjects,</hi>  and the Americans having ceased <lb/>to be in that situations <hi rend="italic">since</hi>  their independence), <lb/>the annuity ought not to revert to this kingdom, <lb/>or to some other of his Majesty's colonies, to be <lb/>applied to similar purposes. This being the first <lb/>determination of that nature since the American <lb/>Revolution, the Lord Chancellor decided it with <lb/>that superior dignity of sentiment that always at<lb break="no"/>tends his decrees. Two phrases are sufficient– <lb/>"all charitable devices are to be held sacred– <lb/>we cannot rake up the ashes of the dead, in search <lb/>of latent intentions. The annuities and arrears <lb/>must be paid, and Messrs. Anderson and Gipps, <lb/>and likewise the city of London, must be paid <lb/>their costs."</p>

               <pb/>On Tuesday afternoon the six Cherokee Chiefs <lb/>visited the Cathedral of St. Paul's, which they <lb/>explain with an equal degree of curiosity and</p>
                <p>
               <pb/>amazement. They were asked whether they <lb/>would not attend the evening service, which they <lb/>readily complied, and seemed particularly de<lb break="no"/>lighted with the organ.</p>
                <p>The Cherokee Chiefs having made us an offer <lb/>of 20,000 men, gratitude obliges us to make <lb/>them some acknowledgement, whether we accept <lb/>their offer or not.–We can very well spare them <lb/>the members of the <hi rend="italic">Halter Club</hi>,–all our house<lb break="no"/>breakers, highwaymen, pick pockets, swindlers, <lb/>Faro and E O Table keepers,–and all their ac<lb break="no"/>complices to an amazing number.</p>
                <p>Such a collection would be a truly valuable <lb/>present.–Among them are found dispersedly all <lb/>the qualities of able Generals,–skilful Financiers, <lb/>–able Negotiators, active Citizens,–and men <lb/>highly expert at a <hi rend="italic">Coup de Main</hi>.</p>
                <p>Were we to add the Pugilistic tribe,–the <lb/>Cherokee Chiefs might on their return to their <lb/>own country enter into a boxing war against their <lb/>enemies–with a certainty of the most brilliant <lb/>success.</p>
                <p>Trading Justices and Lawyers they would per<lb break="no"/>haps be glad to have ; and it is the opinion of <lb/>most people, that a few thousands of the latter <lb/>description of men might be spared.</p>

               <pb/>When the Cherokee Chiefs first visited Covent<lb break="no"/>garden Theatre, one of them appeared much de<lb break="no"/>lighted with the splendid appearance of an In<lb break="no"/>dian cap worn by one of the pantomime actors; <lb/>this being observed, the performer was directed <lb/>the performance; the Chief, amazed at the offer <lb/>of the magnificent present, said, through his in<lb break="no"/>terpreter, " that even in his won country he <lb/>should be unable to repay it ; however, at pre<lb break="no"/>sent he would do the utmost in his power ;" on <lb/>this he ordered the actor to approach him, and <lb/>then lighting his Cherokee pipe stuffed with a <lb/>variety of nauseous combustibles, he too three <lb/>whiffs himself, and presenting the tube, desired <lb/>the actor to take three whiffs also–the greatest <lb/>favour a Cherokee could confer ; the actor, a<lb break="no"/>astonished at the singularity of this unexpected ho<lb break="no"/>nour, reluctantly complied with the request,to the <lb/>great entertainment of the Dramatic circle.</p>

                <p>This Colony is in a perfect state of anarchy ; <lb/>is so much that we have had thoughts of quitting <lb/>the island, and going to Trinidad, taking the ne<lb break="no"/>groes with us. Unless some speedy and effectual <lb/>succours arrive, the colony is utterly ruined. The <lb/>greater part of the colonists, this day, assembled <lb/>at Gros-morne.–The grenadiers, who were in <lb/>the fort of Trinity, with twenty three officers of <lb/>the regiment, were glad to make their escape.– <lb/>There are 1500 men in the FOrt Bourbon, many <lb/>of whom are from Dominica, Guadaloupe, and <lb/>other colonies, an supposed to have been sent by <lb/>Martinico refugees.–The firing of cannon is heard <lb/>incessantly ; at this rate the magazine of powder <lb/>will soon be consumed.</p>
                <p>The Municipality of Fort Royal, have been <lb/>obliged to promise and sign whatever the insur<lb break="no"/>gents have been please to dictate.–The soldiers <lb/>run about the streets and oblige the inhabitants to <lb/>give them money.–Imagine, in short, a scene of <lb/>confusion and terror, and you will then have some <cb/>idea of the persent [?] of Fort Bourbon and <lb/>Fort Royal.</p>
                <p>The town of St. Pierre swarms with strangers, <lb/>who come here from all parts. M. Chabrol, Co<lb break="no"/>lonel of the regiment which has been sent here, <lb/>together with a company of Chaffeurs, has been <lb/>appointed comandant o the NAtional troops.</p>
                <p>The women, confident that it is in his power <lb/>to re-establish tranquility, prostrate themselves be<lb break="no"/>fore him, strew the ground on which he walks <lb/>with flowers, and affectionately embrace him.– <lb/>He seems willing to comply with their wishes.</p>
                <p>The Colonial Assembly sits at Gros-morne <lb/>guarded by an army of 4000 men, under the com<lb break="no"/>mand of M. Dumoise, appointed by the General.</p>
                <p>We are assured, that the insurgents are arming <lb/>four privateers with which they mean to attack <lb/>Trinity. Some soldiers attempted to penetrate <lb/>among them, but were repulsed by the Mulattoes.</p>

                <p>"The drafts at Cork yesterday received the a<lb break="no"/>greeable orders to return to their respective regi<lb break="no"/>ments immediately.</p>
                <p>"The officers appointed to raise independent <lb/>companies in Ireland, have received orders to re<lb break="no"/>pair forthwith to England, with whatever com<lb break="no"/>plement of men already entered, but not to <lb/>proceed with the completion of their number : <lb/>in conference to this order, they are preparing <lb/>for their immediate departure.</p>
                <p>"Last Tuesday two eminent merchants of <lb/>this city received orders, by way of a vessel ar<lb break="no"/>rived at Cork, from Mess de Fouseca Olivarez <lb/>and Co. at Seville, for the immediate exportation <lb/>of cotton, white linen, and mixed goods, to a <lb/>very large amount.</p>
                <p>"Monday evening the Elizabeth and Mary, <lb/>Mark Purcell, master, arrived at Waterford from <lb/>Annapolis, in Maryland, after a long and dan<lb break="no"/>gerous passage, of 52 days, in which they had <lb/>nearly exhausted the whole of their provisions, <lb/>having been a very short allowance of half a <lb/>naggin of rum, diluted with one pint of bad wa<lb break="no"/>ter, for twenty-four hours. She is heavy laden, <lb/>having on board six hundread hogsheads of tobac<lb break="no"/>co, a large quantity of pipe staves, barrel hoops, <lb/>&amp;c. and has been expected more than two months. <lb/>Eight per cent was offered as insurance on ship <lb/>and cargo, but refused, on account of the then <lb/>probability of a war."</p>

            </p>
                <p> IT is our wish, in imitation of other newswrit<lb break="no"/>ters, to give now and then an account of such <lb/>new publications as deserve the attention of the <lb/>public; but in a paper, published only twice a <lb/>week, where so much naturally occurs under the <lb/>article of temporary news, it is but seldom we can <lb/>find room for this purpose:–when, however, a<lb break="no"/>ny ting remarkable appears in the literary world, <lb/>we never fail to notice it, although it may not be <lb/>in our power to give an extensive and critical ac<lb break="no"/>count of its excellencies. We take up the pen <lb/>with real pleasure at present to announce the pu<lb break="no"/>blication of a tragedy, intitled THE INDIANS, the <lb/>reputed offspring of a learned Professor in this U<lb break="no"/>niversity. The great applause with which this <lb/>play was received, when performed at Richmond <lb/>Theatre, has raised the expectations of those who <lb/>were not present at the performance to the high<lb break="no"/>est pitch; and we think we may take upon our<lb break="no"/>selves to assert, that upon perusing it, even their <lb/>highest expetations will not be disappointed.– <lb/>The plot of the piece is taken from a well known <lb/>story published at the end of a volum of poems, <lb/>written by the same gentleman. In the choice <lb/>of a plot, where so many dramatic writers of re<lb break="no"/>spectable talents have erred, our author is peculiar<lb break="no"/>ly happy. He ha strictly observed the advice of <lb/>Horace:</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="center">
                  <hi rend="italic">Denique sit quid vis, simplex dumtaxat et unum</hi>.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>
               <pb/>It is simple, and yet it does not disgust by an <lb/>appearance of nakedness.–It is one, for the com<lb break="no"/>plaints of Maraino, and the return of Oniyo, form <lb/>a beginning; the machinations of Yerdal and <lb/>Neidan to prevent their meeting a middle; and <lb/>defeat of those arts, an end, which combin<lb break="no"/>ed wake up a compleat and connected whole. In <lb/>the delineation of character the author has, on al<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>every occasion, attended to the " <hi rend="italic">quid quemque </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">decent</hi> "–there are hoever some few parts, which <lb/>the critic halts to consider, but which amidst so <lb/>many beauties, he blushes to censure–Some lines, <lb/>for instance in the character of Ononthio, do not <lb/>strike us at first as strictly natural. Is so much <lb/>humanity found inthe breast of an Inan Sachem, <lb/>as to prompt him to spare a victim, about to be <lb/>destroyed accoridng to the custom of the country; <lb/>that victim a captive of war, and not only so, but <lb/>a Briton, who has been fighting against his coun<lb break="no"/>trymen, amongst whom was his only son, whom <lb/>he bleived slain? Would he exert himself so much <lb/>in favour of a stranger and a foe, at the risk of dis<lb break="no"/>pleasing the village, and consequently of losing <lb/>his power? Or is it likely that he would have <lb/>greater influence with the superstitious crowd, <lb/>than he, who was deemed of skill to bend to his <lb/>purpose the demons that sway the fortune of <lb/>mankind?–Another question concenring O<lb break="no"/>nonthio, and we leave him. Is it consistent with <lb/>the philosophic firmness of the Sachem, so to de<lb break="no"/>spair on receiving news of his son's death, as to <lb/>declare that he should know no comfort, but to <lb/>die? or is it consistent with his humanity to leave <lb/>Maraino at such a period of distress, when she most <lb/>stood in need of his kind offices?–The first, and <lb/>best supported character in the piece is that of <lb/>Maraino. Her mind seems intended as the seat <lb/>of every amiable virtue. Her grateful reverence <lb/>of Ononthio, her unaffected piety, and her huma<lb break="no"/>nity, in interfering to save an unknown captive <lb/>from death, are pleasing<supplied>???</supplied> which give<supplied>???</supplied> 
               <lb/>an insight into her nature. In the breast of Ma<lb break="no"/>riano every thing is subordinate to her love for <lb/>Onaiyo: this leading feature in her caracter is <lb/>properly kept in view during the course of the <lb/>piece. But even in this master-piece the author, <lb/>has, perhaps, once deviated a little from nature. <lb/>The sentiments Maraino utters during the con<lb break="no"/>versation with Sydney, in the fifth act, are rather <lb/>those of a Phiosopher and Divine, than a young <lb/>creature, the chorus of whole heart are tuned to <lb/>the sweetest strains of tenderness and love. Can <lb/>she, who had lately discovered a long lost brother, <lb/>talk so coldly in his presence; Can she, who had <lb/>so lately heard of the safety of an adored-husband, <lb/>so entirely banish his image from her mind, as to <lb/>converse on matters so indifferent? Can the gen<lb break="no"/>tle Maraino become the cold moralist?–With this <lb/>one exception, the part of which we are speaking <lb/>is finely drawn and highly interesting.–The lan<lb break="no"/>guage of the piece is every where elegant, and in <lb/>many places, where the sentiment requires it, <lb/>sublime. The author has frequently dignified his <lb/>verse by the introduction of obsolete words; this <lb/>in general produces a good effect–but there is a <lb/>danger of using them too often, and of chusing <lb/>them too ancient. it is a dangerous and difficult <lb/>talk where all is so excellent, to refer to any par<lb break="no"/>ticular passage of scene as deserving most notice: <lb/>it requires no small degree of taste and judgement. <lb/>If there is any preference to be given, it is per<lb break="no"/>haps to that scene in the 2d act, where Onaiyo <lb/>gives an account of the battle at Quebec; and <lb/>the scene in the 4th act, where Maraino is prompt<lb break="no"/>ed by Neidan to slay her brother,–who proves <lb/>his innocence by the production of her husband's <lb/>belt, the sight of which draws an elegant speech <lb/>from the enraptured fair. This scene, however, <lb/>would be improved did it conclude with some<lb break="no"/>thing more apt to the joyful moment, than the so<lb break="no"/>lemn sounds of Ononthio: a speech excellent in <lb/>itself, and containing a very fine sentiment, <lb/>
               <hi rend="center">
                  <hi rend="italic">Sed nunc non erat his locus.–</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
                <p>Upon the whole, the tragedy, upon which we <lb/>have, guided by impartiality, spoken so freely, is <lb/>in our opinion far superior to most of those plays <lb/>which have appeared of late years:–it is devoid <lb/>of bombast:–it is nature–and she must inevita<lb break="no"/>bly please.</p>

               <pb/>Advice from Charlestown, South Carolina, <lb/>says that the Indians in Washington county com<lb break="no"/>mit the most horrid depredations and cruelties. <lb/>They have set fire to several houses; and a wo<lb break="no"/>man, who had a sick husband, telling them from <lb/>a window, of her calamity, they shot her dead on <lb/>the spot, and then set fire to the spot. The sick <lb/>man was consequently burnt.</p>
                <p>A Colonel Harling has greatly exerted and <lb/>distinguished himself in opposing the Indians on <lb/>a part of the American frontiers. This gentle<lb break="no"/>man, with two hundred men, even went into the <lb/>very heart of an Indian settlement, and defeated <lb/>the savages. He then penetrated the country, <lb/>destroying all before him, and returned without <lb/>the loss of a man. Every possible acknowledge<lb break="no"/>ment was made of his services and bravery, and <lb/>a liberal subscription made for his gallant little <lb/>army.</p>

                <p>QUEBEC, <hi rend="italic">December</hi>  2, 1790 <lb/>Yesterday's post from Montreal, conveyed let<lb break="no"/>ters to several gentlemen in town, all corroborati<lb break="no"/>ing the following extract.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="smallcaps">SIR</hi>, <lb/>"I have to inform you by several letters re<lb break="no"/>ceived here on Saturday from Detroit, "we are <lb/>informed the Americans, under General Sinclair, <lb/>had been twice defeated, about the 19th ult. with <lb/>the loss of from 500 to 600 men, by the Indians <lb/>The Indians first attacked a body of 300 horse <lb/>which they had drawn into a snare, and cut the <lb/>whole of them off. In a second engagement, they <lb/>were likewise victorious, having nearly killed as <lb/>many. On account of which, Sinclair thought <lb/>proper to retreat; and the last accounts state the <lb/>Indians having divided themselves into small par<lb break="no"/>ties, had so harrassed him, that he was obliged to <lb/>leave the wounded in the field–Sinclair lost his <lb/>artillery, a cohorn, and grass-hopper. It is said <lb/>the Indians are very much elated at their success, <lb/>and that numbers were daily joining them, at <lb/>their head quarters, about the Maimis towns– <lb/>One Indian, it is said, killed 30 with his own <lb/>hand.</p>
                <p>"The Indians were extremely civil to the <lb/>traders from Detriot, having assisted them, when <lb/>they knew of the approach of the Americans, to <lb/>remove their property to safety, except ammuni<lb break="no"/>tion and arms. These are facts so well ascertain<lb break="no"/>ed, that there does not remain the least doubt <lb/>of them:</p>
                <p>They may be attended with very serious and <lb/>important consequences to the province, as I dare <lb/>say, all will be imputed to the British for supply<lb break="no"/>ing these Indians with arms and ammunition.– <lb/>In short, I would not be surprized to hear of an <lb/>American army raising, to attack this country. <lb/>* The loss is here specified, but other letters differing <lb/>in number, we shall only say, the estimate in general <lb/>does not appear considerable.</p>

               <pb n="3"/> CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.</p>
                <p>The following account of the inhabitants of this <lb/>settlement is given by a late traveller.</p>
                <p>The education of youth has hitherto been very <lb/>much neglected: the government never hit upon any <lb/>successful plan for the establishment of public schools; <cb/>and the individual had no other ambition but that of <lb/>qualifying his sons, by writing and accounts, to be<lb break="no"/>come servants of the Company. This body of mer<lb break="no"/>chants had a number of persons in their employ, <lb/>who were very ill paid. Their salaries, indeed, were <lb/>sufficient to afford them a bare subsistence ; but it ta<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>citly allowed them to negotiate for themselves: the <lb/>consequence of such a conduct was, that each be<lb break="no"/>came a kind of petty dealer. Each had his little pri<lb break="no"/>vate shop in some corner of his house. The most pal<lb break="no"/>try articles were in the list of their commodities for <lb/>sale ; and those who ranked high in government, <lb/>and assumed a string of full-founding epithets to <lb/>their names, felt no sore of indignity in retailing the <lb/>produce of their gardens ; not indeed, avowedly, but <lb/>through the medium of their slaves. In fact, the minds <lb/>of every class, the Governor, the Clergy, the F[?]l, <lb/>and the Secretary of the Court of Justice excepted, <lb/>were wholly bent on trade. <hi rend="italic">Knopman</hi>, or merchant, <lb/>was a title that conferred rank at the Cape, to which <lb/>the military even aspired. On this subject the ideas <lb/>of the Dutch differ widely from those of the Chi<lb break="no"/>nese, who have degraded the merchant into the <lb/>very lowest order of their society.</p>
                <p>That portion of the day, not employed in the <lb/>concerns of trade, is usually devoted to the grati<lb break="no"/>fication of the sensual appetite. Few have any taste <lb/>for reading, and none for the cultivation of the fine <lb/>arts.–They have no kind of public amusements, <lb/>except occasional balls ; nor is there much social <lb/>intercourse but by family parties; which usually <lb/>consist of card playing or dancing. Money-mat<lb break="no"/>ters and merchandize engross their whole conver<lb break="no"/>sation : yet none are opulent, though many in easy <lb/>circumstances. There are no beggars in the whole <lb/>colony, and but a few who are objects of public cha<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>rity. The subsistence for these is derived from the <lb/>interest of a fund established out of the church su<lb break="no"/>perfluities, from alms, donations, and collections, <lb/>made after divine service, and not from any tax laid <lb/>upon the public. Except, indeed, a few colonial <lb/>assessments for the repairs of the streets and public <lb/>works, the inhabitants of the Cape have little <lb/>drawback on their profits, on the produce of their <lb/>labour.</p>
                <p>It has been the remark of most travellers, that <lb/>the ladies of the Cape are pretty, lively, and good <lb/>humoured ; possessing little of that phlegmatic tem<lb break="no"/>per which is a principal trait in the national charac<lb break="no"/>ter of the Dutch. The difference in the manners <lb/>and appearance of the young men and the young <lb/>women, in the same family, is inconceivably great. <lb/>The former are clumsy in their shape, awkward in <lb/>in their carriage, and of an unsocial disposition; <lb/>whilst the latter are generally of a small, delicate <lb/>form, below the middle size, of easy and unaffected <lb/>manners, well dressed, and fond of social intercourse; <lb/>an indulgence in which they are seldom restrained <lb/>by their parents, and which they as seldom turn to <lb/>abuse. They are here indeed less dependent on, <lb/>and less subject to, the caprice of parents than else <lb/>where. Primogeniture entitles to no advantage; <lb/>but all the children, male and female, share alike <lb/>in the family property. No parent can disinherit a <lb/>child without assigning, on proof, on at least of <lb/>the fourteen reasons enumerated in the Justinian <lb/>Code.</p>
                <p>By the law of the colony, a community of all <lb/>property, both real and personal, is supposed to take <lb/>place on the marriage of two person unless the <lb/>contrary should be particularly provided against by <lb/>solemn contract made before marriage. Where no <lb/>such contract exists, the children, on the death of <lb/>either parent, are entitled to that half of the joint <lb/>property, which was supposed to belong to the de<lb break="no"/>ceased, and which cannot be withheld on applica<lb break="no"/>tion after they are come of age.</p>
                <p>It is but justice to the young females of the Cape <lb/>to r emark, that many of them have profited much <lb/>more than could be expected from the limited <lb/>means of education that the place affords. In the <lb/>better families, most of them are taught music, and <lb/>some have acquired a tolerable degree of execution. <lb/>Many understand the French language, and some <lb/>have made great proficiency in the English. They <pb n="4"/> are expert at the needle, and all kinds of lace, knot<lb break="no"/>ting, and tambour work, and in general make up <lb/>their own dresses, following the prevailing fashion <lb/>of England brought from time to time by the female <lb/>passengers bound to India, from whom they may <lb/>be said to <lb/>
               <hi rend="center">"Catch the manners living as they rise"</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Neither are the other sex, while boys, deficient <lb/>in vivacity or talent ; but, for want of the means of <lb/>a proper education, to open their minds, and excite <lb/>in them a desire of knowledge, they soon degene<lb break="no"/>rate into the common routine of eating, smoaking [sic], <lb/>and sleeping. Few of the male inhabitants associate <lb/>with the English, except such as hold employments <lb/>under the Government. This backwardness may <lb/>be said to be owing in part to the different habits of <lb/>the two nations, and partly, perhaps, to the reluc<lb break="no"/>tance that a vanquished people must always feel in <lb/>mixing with their conquerors.</p>

               <pb/>As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at <lb/>the opening of the Congress of the United <lb/>States at New York, Nov. 6 1792, gives an <lb/>impartial account of the situation of tha coun<lb break="no"/>try, we are persuaded it will be found not un<lb break="no"/>entertaining to our readers.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the  <lb/>House of Representatives,</hi>
            </p>
                <p>IT is some abatement of the satisfaction, with <lb/>which I meet you on the present occasion, <lb/>that in felicitating you on a continuance of the <lb/>national prosperity, generally, I am not able to <lb/>add to it information that the Indian hostilities, <lb/>which have for some time past, distressed our <lb/>western frontier, have terminated:</p>
                <p>You will, I am persuaded, learn, with no less <lb/>concern, than I communicate it, that reiterated <lb/>endeavours, towards effecting a pacification, have <lb/>hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs <lb/>of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes <lb/>with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire <lb/>to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop <lb/>the further effusion of blood–to arrest the pro<lb break="no"/>gress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of <lb/>the nation, for peace, has led to strenuous efforts, <lb/>through various channels, to accomplish these de<lb break="no"/>sirable purposes:–In making which efforts, I <lb/>consulted less my own anticipations of the event, <lb/>or the scruples which some considerations were <lb/>calculated to inspire, than the wish to find the ob<lb break="no"/>ject attainable; to ascertain, unequivocally, that <lb/>such is the case.</p>
                <p>A detail of the measures which have been pur<lb break="no"/>sued, and of their consequences, which will be <lb/>laid before you, while it will confirm to you the <lb/>want of success, thus far, will, I trust, evince <lb/>that means, as proper and as efficacious, as could <lb/>have been devised have been employed. The <lb/>issue of some of them, indeed, is still depending; <lb/>but a favorable one, though not to be despaired <lb/>of, is not promised by anything that has yet hap<lb break="no"/>pened.</p>
                <p>In the course of the attempts, which have been <lb/>made some valuable citizens have fallen victims <lb/>to their zeal for the public service. A sanction <lb/>commonly respected, even among savages, has been <lb/>found, in this instance, insufficient to protect <lb/>from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will, I <cb/>presume, be duly considered whether the occasion <lb/>does not call for an exercise of liberality towards <lb/>the families of the deceased.</p>
                <p>It must add to your concern, to be informed <lb/>that besides the continuation of hostile appearances <lb/>among the tribes north of the Ohio, some threat<lb break="no"/>ening symptoms have of late been revived among <lb/>some of those south of it.</p>
                <p>A part of the Cherokees, known by the name <lb/>of Chickamagas, inhabiting five villages on the <lb/>Tennessee River, have long been in the practice of <lb/>committing depredations on the neighbouring <lb/>settlements.</p>
                <p>It was hoped that the treaty of Holston, made <lb/>with the Cherokee Nation in July 1791, would <lb/>have prevented a repetition of such depredations. <lb/>But the event has not answered this hope. The <lb/>Chickamagas, aided by some banditti of another <lb/>tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated <lb/>wanton and unprovoked hostilities, upon the ci<lb break="no"/>tizens of the United States in that quarter. The <lb/>information which has been received on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive pre<lb break="no"/>cautions only have been enjoined and observed.</p>
                <p>It is not understood that any breach of treaty <lb/>or aggression whatsoever, on the part of the Uni<lb break="no"/>ted States or their citizens, is even alleged, as <lb/>a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter.</p>
                <p>I have reason to believe, that every practicable <lb/>exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision <lb/>by law for that purpose) to be prepared for <lb/>the alternative of a prosecution of the war, in the <lb/>event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large <lb/>proportion of the troops authorized to be raised <lb/>have been recruited, though the number is still <lb/>incomplete, and pains have been taken to disci<lb break="no"/>pline and put them in condition for the particu<lb break="no"/>lar kind of service to be performed. A delay of <lb/>operations (besides being dictated by the measures <lb/>which were pursuing towards a pacific termina<lb break="no"/>tion of the war) has been in itself deemed prefe<lb break="no"/>rable to immature efforts. A statement, from the <lb/>proper department, with regard to the number <lb/>of troops raised, and some other points which <lb/>have been suggested, will afford more precise in<lb break="no"/>formation as a guide to the legislative consultations <lb/>and among other things, will enable Congress to <lb/>judge whether some additional stimulus to the re<lb break="no"/>cruiting service may not be advisable.</p>
                <p>In looking forward to the future expense of <lb/>the operations which may be found inevitable, I <lb/>derive consolation from the information I receive <lb/>that the product of the revenues for the present <lb/>year, is likely to supersede the necessity of addi<lb break="no"/>tional burthens on the community, for the service <lb/>of the ensuing year. This however, will be bet<lb break="no"/>ter ascertained in the course of the session; and it <lb/>is proper to add, that the information alluded to <lb/>proceeds upon the supposition of no material ex<lb break="no"/>tension of the spirit of hostilities.</p>
                <p>I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs, <lb/>without again recommending to your considera<lb break="no"/>tion the expediency of more adequate provision <lb/>for giving energy to the laws throughout our in<lb break="no"/>terior frontier; and for restraining the commission <lb/>of outrages upon the Indians; without which all <lb/>pacific plans must prove nugatory–To enable by <lb/>competent rewards, the employment of qualified <lb/>and trusty persons to reside among them, as agents, <lb/>would also contribute to the preservation of peace <lb/>and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these <lb/>expedients, an eligible plan could be devised for <lb/>promoting civilization among the friendly tribes, <lb/>and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale <lb/>equal to their wants, and under regulations calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to protect them from imposition and extor<lb break="no"/>tion, its influence in cementing their interest <lb/>with ours could not but be considerable.</p>
                <p>The prosperous state of our revenue has been <lb/>intimated–This would be still more the case, <lb/>were it not for the impediments which in some <cb/>places continue to embarrass the collection of the <lb/>duties on spirits, distilled within the United States. <lb/>These impediments have lessened, and are lessened <lb/>in local extent; and as applied to the community <lb/>at large, the contentment with the law appears <lb/>to be progressive.</p>
                <p>But symptoms of increased opposition having <lb/>lately manifested themselves in certain quarters, <lb/>I judged a special interposition on my part, proper <lb/>and advisable, and under this impression have <lb/>issued a proclamation warning against all unlaw<lb break="no"/>ful combinations and proceedings, having for their <lb/>object or tending to obstruct the operation of <lb/>the law in question, and announcing that all law<lb break="no"/>ful ways and means would be strictly put in exe<lb break="no"/>cution for bringing to justice the infractors there<lb break="no"/>of and securing obedience thereto.</p>
                <p>Measures have also been taken for the prosecu<lb break="no"/>tion of offenders. And Congress may be assured <lb/>that nothing within constitutional and legal limits <lb/>which may depend upon me, shall be wanting to as<lb break="no"/>sert and maintain the just authority of the laws. <lb/>In fulfilling this trust, I shall count entirely upon <lb/>the full cooperation of the other departments of <lb/>the Government and upon the zealous support of <lb/>all good citizens.</p>
                <p>I can not forbear to bring again into the view <lb/>of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the <lb/>judiciary system. A representation from the jud<lb break="no"/>ges of the supreme court, which will be laid be<lb break="no"/>fore you, points out some of the inconveniences <lb/>that are experienced. In the course of the execu<lb break="no"/>tion of the laws considerations rise out of the <lb/>structure of the system, which in some cases, tend <lb/>to relax their efficacy. As connected with this <lb/>subject, provisions to facilitate the taking of bail <lb/>upon processes out of the courts of the United <lb/>States, and a supplementary definition of offenses <lb/>against the constitution and laws of the union, and <lb/>of the punishment for such offenses will, it is pre<lb break="no"/>sumed, be found worthy of particular attention.</p>
                <p>Observations on the value of peace with other <lb/>nations are unnecessary. It would be wise, how<lb break="no"/>ever, by timely provisions to guard against those <lb/>acts of our own citizens which might tend to dis<lb break="no"/>turb it, and to put ourselves in a condition to <lb/>give that satisfaction to foreign nations, which we <lb/>may sometimes have occasion to require from them. <lb/>I particularly recommend to your consideration of <lb/>the means of preventing those aggressions by our <lb/>citizens on the territory of other nations, and <lb/>other infractions of the law of nations, which <lb/>furnishes just subject of complaint, might endan<lb break="no"/>ger our peace with them. And, in general, the <lb/>maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign <lb/>powers will be presented to your attention by the <lb/>expiration of the law for that purpose, which takes <lb/>place, if not renewed, at the close of the present <lb/>session.</p>
                <p>In execution of the authority given by the le<lb break="no"/>gislature, measures have been taken for engaging <lb/>some artists from abroad to aid in the establish<lb break="no"/>ment of our mint; others have been employed at <lb/>home. Provision has been made of the requisite <lb/>buildings, and these are now putting into proper <lb/>condition for the purposes of the establishment. <lb/>There has also been a small beginning in the coin<lb break="no"/>age of half dimes, the want of small coins in cir<lb break="no"/>culation calling the first attention to them.</p>
                <p>The regulation of foreign coins in correspon<lb break="no"/>dency with the principles of our national coinage, <lb/>as being essential to their due operation, and to <lb/>order in our money concerns, will, I doubt not, be <lb/>resumed and completed.</p>
                <p>It is represented that some provisions in the <lb/>law, which establishes the Post-Office, operate, <lb/>in experiment, against the transmission of news<lb break="no"/>papers to distant parts of the country.–Should <lb/>this, upon due enquiry, be found to be the fact, <lb/>a full conviction of the importance of facilitating <lb/>the circulation of political intelligence and infor<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
                <p>
               <pb/>mation, will, I doubt not, lead to the application <lb/>of a remedy.</p>
                <p>The adoption of a constitution for the state of <lb/>Kentucky, has been notified to me. The legis<lb break="no"/>lature will share with me in the satisfaction which <lb/>arises from an event interesting to the happiness <lb/>of the part of the nation to which it relates, and <lb/>conducive to the general order.</p>
                <p>It is proper likewise to inform you, that since <lb/>my last communication on the subject, and in <lb/>further execution of the acts, severally making <lb/>provision for the public debt, and for the reduc<lb break="no"/>tion thereof, three new loans have been effected, <lb/>each for three millions of florins,–one at Ant<lb break="no"/>werp, at the annual interest of four and one-half <lb/>per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in <lb/>lieu of all charges.–The rates of these loans, and <lb/>the circumstances under which they have been <lb/>made are confirmations of the high state of our <lb/>credit abroad.</p>
                <p>Among the objects to which these funds have <lb/>been directed to be applied, the payment of the <lb/>debts due to certain foreign officers, according to <lb/>the provision made during the last session, has <lb/>been embraced.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen of the House of Representatives</hi>.</p>
                <p>I entertain a strong hope, that the state of the <lb/>national finances is now sufficiently matured to <lb/>enable you to enter upon a systematic and effec<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>tual arrangement for the regular redemption and <lb/>discharge of the public debt, according to the <lb/>right which has been reserved to the government <lb/>–no measure can be more desirable, whether view<lb break="no"/>ed with an eye to its intrinsic importance, or to <lb/>the general sentiment and wish of the nation.</p>
                <p>Provision is likewise requisite for the reimburse<lb break="no"/>ment of the loan which has been made of the <lb/>Bank of the United States, pursuant to the sec<lb break="no"/>tion of the act by which it is incorporated. <lb/>In fulfilling the public stipulations, in this particular, <lb/>it is expected a valuable saving will be made.</p>
                <p>Appropriations for the current service of the en<lb break="no"/>suing year and for such extraordinaries as may <lb/>require provision, will demand, and I doubt not <lb/>will engage, your early attention.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives</hi>.</p>
                <p>I content myself with recalling your attention, <lb/>generally to such objects, not particularized in <lb/>my present, as have been suggested in my former <lb/>communications to you.</p>
                <p>Various temporary laws will expire during the <lb/>present session. Among these, that which regu<lb break="no"/>lates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, <lb/>will merit particular notice.</p>
                <p>The results of your common deliberations hi<lb break="no"/>therto will, I trust, be productive of solid and <lb/>durable advantages to our constituents; such as, <lb/>by conciliating more and more their ultimate suf<lb break="no"/>frage, will tend to strengthen and confirm their <lb/>attachment, upon which, under Divine Providence, <lb/>materially depend their union, their safety, and <lb/>their happiness.</p>
                <p>Still further to promote and secure these inesti<lb break="no"/>mable ends there is nothing which can have a <lb/>more powerful tendency, than the careful culti<lb break="no"/>vation of harmony, combined with a due regard <lb/>to stability, in the public councils.</p>

                <p>On the 27th instant a body of Indians attacked <lb/>Greenfield station: they killed John Jervis, and <lb/>a negro fellow, belonging to Mrs. Tarker. By <lb/>the bravery of three young men, viz. William Nee<lb break="no"/>ly, William Wilson, and William Hall, the station <lb/>was preserved; they killed two Indians, wounded <lb/>several others, and put them to flight. It is to be <lb/>remembered, that Neely and Hall had each lost a <lb/>father and two brothers, and Wilson a brother, by <lb/>the savages. Men are now in pursuit of the Indi<lb break="no"/>ans.</p>

               <lb/>Advices from our western frontiers mention, <lb/>that Major General Twiggs crossed the Oconnee <lb/>with about 900 men, on Saturday last, on their <lb/>way to the Cakmulgee, where the infantry were to <lb/>halt and build a fort. The cavalry, amounting <lb/>to 450, commanded by Brigadier Generals Irwin, <lb/>Clark, and Blackburn, were immediately to pro<lb break="no"/>ceed to the lower Creek towns, and procure satis<lb break="no"/>faction for the numerous unprovoked murders and <lb/>devastations lately committed by that faithless tribe <lb/>of savages.</p>
                <p>Brigadier General Glascock, we are informed, <lb/>has received orders from the Commander in Chief <lb/>to march to the frontiers in a few days, with one- <lb/>third of his brigade, and part of the Augusta ar<lb break="no"/>tillery.</p>

               <pb/>At four o'clock yesterday morning Mess. Muir, <lb/>Skirving, and Margarot, were taken from their <lb/>beds, without any previous notice, <hi rend="italic">hand-cuffed</hi>, and <lb/>put into a post-chaise, to be conveyed to Woolwich, <lb/>where a vessel waits to sail with them immediately <lb/>for Botany Bay.</p>
                <p>Mr. Palmer has, we understood, been sent from <lb/>on board the hulks, in the same manner, to take <lb/>his passage on board the same vessel.</p>
                <p>Between 10 and 11 o'clock, about sixty female <lb/>convicts were put on board a vessel at Blackfriars <lb/>bridge, destined to the same voyage. These latter <lb/>behaved in a most turbulent manner and even <lb/>fought in the hold of the boat. There were among <lb/>them one or two well dressed women ; and what <lb/>was more lamentable in the eyes of the spectator, <lb/>some of had infants with them.</p>

               <pb n="5"/> Yesterday forenoon arrived at Spithead, the <lb/>Lord Dorcester merchantman, Edward Howe, <lb/>master, bound from Halifax for London.</p>
                <p>In this ship came six Cherokee Chiefs, of the <lb/>first rank, one of them born in England.</p>
                <p>As soon as their arrival was announced in form, <lb/>Sir Andrew Douglas, Commander of the Alcide, <lb/>of 74 guns, sent his barge to bring them ashore <lb/>to Portsmouth; and, upon landing, they went to <lb/>Bradley's, the crown Inn.</p>
                <p>The object of these Chiefs coming to this coun<lb break="no"/>try is, to endeavour to form a connection with the <lb/>English Government, in order to attempt the re<lb break="no"/>duction of Mexico, near which place they have <lb/>20,000 men in arms, and can raise 30,000 more <lb/>in a short time.</p>
                <p>The Cherokees have menaced that country for <lb/>these last three years, and are favoured by great <lb/>number of the inhabitants in the Spanish settle<lb break="no"/>ments; should they, therefore, procure respectable <lb/>assistance from England, the New World will be <lb/>a certain conquest, and open a source of trade and <lb/>wealth to this nation, that will more than com<lb break="no"/>pensate for the loss of America, and the expence <lb/>of attaining that grand object.</p>
                <p>These Indian Chiefs are dressed in the habit of <lb/>their country, with their faces painted in an ex<lb break="no"/>traordinary manner. They waited on Colonel <lb/>Trigge, of the 12th regiment of foot, and some <lb/>other officers of distinction. One of them, who <lb/>was born in England, named Bowles, speaks Eng<lb break="no"/>lish indifferently well, and is extremely communi<lb break="no"/>cative. He went over to America with his pa<lb break="no"/>rents, who were in the army, when a boy, and by <lb/>some means strayed to an Indian camp, where he <lb/>was most hospitably received, and afterwards rais<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ed to the highest honours of their nation.</p>
                <p>The Cherokee Chiefs are expected in town this <lb/>day, to deliver their<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> to Mr. Secretary <lb/>Grenville.</p>

               <lb/>By the Fanny, Capt. Bryen, arrived in twenty <lb/>four days from New York, we have American <lb/>papers, of which we give the following important <lb/>intelligence:–</p>
                <p>It is an undoubted truth, (Strange as it may <lb/>appear) that the Baron D'Carondolet, Governor <lb/>of Louisiana, and Governor O'Neal, of Pensaco<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>la, have opened the shores of the King of Spain, <lb/>in West-Florida, to the Creeks and Cherokees, <lb/>and delivered them arms and ammunition in abun<lb break="no"/>dance, advising and stimulating them to go to <lb/>war against the frontier inhabitants of the United <lb/>States, and that quickly, that now or never was <lb/>the time, while the United States were engaged <lb/>with the northern tribes.</p>
                <p>On the 30th of September, about midnight <lb/>John Buchanan's station, four miles south of Nash<lb break="no"/>ville,) at which sundry families had collected, and <lb/>fifteen gunmen) was attacked by a part of <lb/>Creeks and Lower Cherokees, supposed to con<lb break="no"/>sist of three of our hundred. Their approach <lb/>was suspected by the running of cattle, that had <lb/>taken fright at them, and upon examination, they <lb/>were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of <lb/>the gate, and from the place and distance they <lb/>received the first fire from the man who discover<lb break="no"/>ed them John M'Rocy. They immediately re<lb break="no"/>turned the fire, and continued a very heavy and <lb/>constant firing upon the station, blockhouses sur<lb break="no"/>rounded with a stockade for an hour, and were re<lb break="no"/>pulsed with considerable loss, without injuring <lb/>man, woman, or child, in the station.</p>
                <p>During the whole time of the attack, the In<lb break="no"/>dians were never more distant than ten yards from <lb/>the Block House, and often in large numbers <lb/>close round the lower walls, attempting to put <lb/>fire to it. One ascended the roof with a torch, <lb/>where he was shot, and falling to the ground, re<lb break="no"/>newed his attempts to fire the bottom logs, and <lb/>was killed. The Indians fired 30 balls through <lb/>a port hole of the over<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>ing, which lodged in <lb/>the roof in the circumference of the bat, and those <lb/>sticking in the walls on the outside are innume<lb break="no"/>rable.</p>
                <p>Undoubted advices have been received that as <lb/>early at the 18th of September, as many as 500 <lb/>Creeks passed the Tennessee, and the lower Chero<lb break="no"/>kee towns, and below, as on their way they de<lb break="no"/>cared to make war on Cumberland–and that they <lb/>were joined by about 100 Cherokees of those <lb/>towns.–This must have been the party that attack<lb break="no"/>ed Buchanan's station. Dreadful havoc was ex<lb break="no"/>pected, but it is now hoped, that the check they <lb/>have received will induce them to return without <lb/>making further attempts upon that settlement.</p>
                <p>On the 3d instant. Black's Block House on the <lb/>head of Crooked Creek, (a branch of Little Ri<lb break="no"/>ver) at which there was a serjeant's command, of <lb/>Cape, Crawford's company, was attacked, by sur<lb break="no"/>prise, about an hour and a half in the night, by <lb/>a party of Indians, commanded by a Cherokee of <lb/>Will's Town called the Tail, a brother of the <lb/>Bench, and Talohteske, consisting of 3 other Che<lb break="no"/>rokees and 5 Creeks.</p>
                <p>James Paul was killed in the knife, and George <lb/>Morse and Robert Sharp, at a fire on the outside <lb/>and John Shankland wounded, 3 horses were kil<lb break="no"/>led, and 7 taken off.</p>
                <p>These are the fruits of the advise of the Baron <lb/>D'Carrondolet and Governor O'Neal; and it is <lb/>due to Mr. Paton, their chief instrument, to add <lb/>he has well acted his part!!!</p>
                <p>We hear from Fayetteville (North Carolina), <lb/>that on Tuesday the 23d of October last a fire <lb/>broke out in that town, owing to the negligence <lb/>of a small negro girl, which consumed about 40 <lb/>dwelling houses and stores, and 28 buildings of <lb/>other descriptions.</p>

            </p>
                <p>Our humanity was deeply affected by the dread<lb break="no"/>ful carnage made by the Indians. You may be <lb/>assured that the number of Indians did not exceed <lb/>1000, and that nothing saved General St. Clair, <lb/>and the remainder of his army, but the great quan<lb break="no"/>tity of plunder he left to the Indians; they were <lb/>composed of various tribes, and three-fourths of <lb/>of them remained in the camp to plunder it, and to <lb/>take scalps, the trophies of their victory; and he <lb/>that got most when he returned to his nation, ac<lb break="no"/>quired the greatest share of glory; hence only a<lb break="no"/>bout 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is un<lb break="no"/>der 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they <lb/>have obtained at so easy a purchase, and the riches <lb/>they obtained by the plunder, and the provisions <lb/>they found, will make them a more terrible foe <lb/>than ever they have been; they boast of taking an <lb/>amazing quantity of powder and arms, which they <lb/>wanted; many of them were only armed with <lb/>spears and hatchets, and I have no doubt but if a<lb break="no"/>nother expedition should be set on foot, that they <lb/>will be met by three times the number of Indians. <lb/>The indian tribes of nations who live many hun<lb break="no"/>dred miles back have all entered into an association, <lb/>and made the present war a common concern, they <lb/>to oppose what they call the common enemy. The <lb/>warriors of the different tribes so united are not <lb/>less than 15 or 20,000; numbers of the chiefs of <lb/>ten or twelve numerous nations were here last sum<lb break="no"/>mer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make <lb/>peace, and offered his mediations; he told them he <lb/>was at peace with the United States, and could <lb/>give them no assistance. Their answer was, that <lb/>the enemy was in their country, and would not <lb/>make peace with them, but on term dishonourable, <lb/>and at the expense of their country, and that they <lb/>had determined to die before they would accept of <lb/>such terms. They felt much dissatisfied with the <lb/>answer they received, and departed with a full de<lb break="no"/>termination to defend their country with the last <lb/>of their blood.</p>
                <p>You may depend on it, that many years will e<lb break="no"/>lapse, and many thousand men be expended before <lb/>the United States will, by the present measures, <lb/>be able to possess the country in contest; and I <lb/>may also add, that I have great apprehensions, that <cb/>desolation and destruction will be the consequence <lb/>on the frontiers of the Ohio this winter and next <lb/>spring; I would to God some steps might be tak<lb break="no"/>en to prevent them. I have no doubt the coun<lb break="no"/>try might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the <lb/>expence already incurred by the different expedi<lb break="no"/>tions; the attempt to take the country from them <lb/>by force, is founded in unrighteousness, and ought <lb/>to be abandoned; besides, if the American mean <lb/>to have anytrade with them, they are taking steps <lb/>that will prevent it for many years to come. The <lb/>Indians do not easily forget or forgive injuries</p>

                <p>"Last Sunday evening came to this town a <lb/>young man from Cat-fish, which he left about two <lb/>weeks ago, and who gave us the following pleasing <lb/>interesting, and important intelligence, viz, that <lb/>two days before he left Cat-fish, two men arrived <lb/>there from Licking, who informed, that they had <lb/>been out with a body of 1300 volunteers on horse<lb break="no"/>back from Kentucky, under General Scott; that <lb/>they left Licking on the expedition a few days be<lb break="no"/>fore Christmas; that General Scott dispatched <lb/>three spies in advance, who, when they arrived a<lb break="no"/>bout 13 miles beyond the spot where General St. <lb/>Clair was defeated they discovered a large body of <lb/>Indians diverting and enjoying themselves with the <lb/>plunder they had taken, riding the bullocks, dan<lb break="no"/>cing, &amp;c. and appeared to be mostly drunk; that <lb/>on the information being given to General Scott, <lb/>who, with the main body, were a few miles in the <lb/>rear, he divided them into three divisions, advan<lb break="no"/>ced, and fell on the enemy by surprise; that the <lb/>contest was short, but victorious, on the side of the <lb/>volunteers, 700 of the enemy being killed on the <lb/>spot, all the cannon and stores in their possession <lb/>retaken, and the remainder of that savage body put <lb/>to flight; that General Scott, having lost but six <lb/>men, returned to Licking in triumph, with most <lb/>of the cattle, stores, &amp;c. leaving the cannon at <lb/>Fort Jefferson; that General Scott had previous<lb break="no"/>ly gone out with 400 men, but finding his num<lb break="no"/>ber was insufficient, was returning but met a body <lb/>of 900 volunteers when, upon joining him, he im<lb break="no"/>mediately proceeded in prosecution of his original <lb/>design which fortunately proved successful.</p>
                <p>"Our informant further adds, that he saw a <lb/>Kentucky newspaper of the 8th of January, at <lb/>Morgan Town, brought by Major Scott's expedi<lb break="no"/>tion, which corresponded with that given by the <lb/>two men at Cat Fish, and that Gen. Scott brought <lb/>in near 700 scalps."</p>

               <pb n="2"/> The unsettled state of a great part of the West<lb break="no"/>tern Frontiers of America (if we can suppose that <lb/>there are any determined frontiers when the set<lb break="no"/>tlers are making large and continual encroach<lb break="no"/>ments) must very much depreciate the sale of lands <lb/>in those parts, notwithstanding the very small <lb/>rates of purchase demanded for vast extents of <lb/>ground, and the soil being remarkable fertile and <lb/>productive. The ineffectual attempts of last sum<lb break="no"/>mer to prevent the future depredations of the Mi<lb break="no"/>amis, and some other tribes of Indians, and the <lb/>barbarities before and since committed on the set<lb break="no"/>lers, must occasion other people to be very cau<lb break="no"/>tious of removing to places where they would hold <lb/>their lives and property on a very precarious te<lb break="no"/>ure, unless the arms of the State prove remark<lb break="no"/>ably successful in their future attacks.</p>

               <pb n="5"/> The Indian Chiefs lately arrived in town are six <lb/>in number. They have been indiscriminately styl<lb break="no"/>ed Cherokees, but three of them only are of that <lb/>nation, and three are Creek Indians.–They are <lb/>all handsome men, not exceeding in age twenty - <lb/>five or twenty-six. These six Chiefs have 20,000 <lb/>warriors ready to take the field, and have the <lb/>strongest wish to act in conjunction with the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish. They travelled 3000 miles before the reach<lb break="no"/>ed Halifax, and were near 12 months in perform<lb break="no"/>ing the journey. From Halifax they went in an <lb/>English frigate to Quebec to Lord Dorchester, <lb/>by whom they were sent over to England to con<lb break="no"/>cert their plans in person with the Ministry.</p>
                <p>The object of their coming to this country may <lb/>be easily guessed at. They long to make an at<lb break="no"/>tack upon the Spanish settlements. One of them <lb/>was heard last night in the playhouse to say, he <lb/>hoped in six months from this time to be in the <lb/>heart of Mexico.</p>

               <pb n="2"/> When hostilities are once commenced, a for<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>fidable armament will unquestionable be sent a<lb break="no"/>gainst the Spanish South American colonies. Of <lb/>its success there cannot be a doubt, when we shall <lb/>be aided by an army of 20,000 Indian warriors, <lb/>beside the active support of those Mexicans now <lb/>
               <supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> under the tyranous yoke of Spain.</p>
                <p>
               <pb n="3"/> So determined are the Cherokees, the Creeks, <lb/>and other nations of Indians in the Southern parts <lb/>of America, to strip the Spaniards of their pos<lb break="no"/>sessions on that Continent, that they will unque<lb break="no"/>stionably attempt the glorious achievement, even <lb/>though the policy of this country should prevent <lb/>us from lending them effectual assistance.</p>
                <p>The rich silver mines at Potosi, in Peru, were <lb/>accidentally discovered in 1545, by an Indian, as <lb/>he was clambering up the mountain, in pursuit <lb/>of a Lama, which had strayed from his flock. <lb/>Soon after, the mines, of Sacotecas, in New <lb/>Spain, little inferior to the other in value, were <lb/>opened. From that time successive discoveries <lb/>have been made in both colonies, and silver mines <lb/>are now so numerous that the working of them, <lb/>and of some few mines of gold in the provinces <lb/>of Terra Firm, and the new Kingdom of Gre<lb break="no"/>nada, has become the capital occupation of the <lb/>Spaniards, and is reduced into the system no less <lb/>complicated than interesting.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Muskingum  <lb/>to his Friend in the City of Norwich, (Connecti<lb break="no"/>cut,) dated Nov</hi>. 24, 1790.</p>
                <p>"The prospect of peace from our frontiers, <lb/>seems to me to be vanished for the present; the <lb/>troops from this garrison have this morning re<lb break="no"/>turned, and the best account I can collect of the <lb/>expedition is as follows: viz. the troops amount<lb break="no"/>ing to about 1200 militia, and about 300 regulars, <lb/>after seventeen days march from Miami, reached <lb/>the great Miami village, about 170 miles, with<lb break="no"/>out any molestation, except having a number of <lb/>their pack-horse stole.–On their arrival they <lb/>found the village deserted, and all the valua<lb break="no"/>ble builder a short tarry, they proceeded to neigh<lb break="no"/>ings set on flames by the Indians. Af<lb break="no"/>bouring villages, without molestation, and def<lb break="no"/>troyed five of them, and a quantity of corn, com<lb break="no"/>puted at fifteen thousand bushels, which they <lb/>found buried in different places, and very large <lb/>quantities of vegetables of every kind. The fir<supplied reason="copy blur">st</supplied> 
               <lb/>opposition that was met with, a party of about <lb/>150 Kentucky militia, and thirty regular troops, <lb/>all under the command of Col. Hardin, of Ken<lb break="no"/>tucky, were detached from the main body, lying <lb/>in the great Miami village, to pursue the track <lb/>of a party of Indians which had the day before <lb/>been discovered. After a pursuit of about six <lb/>miles, they came up with, and were attacked by <lb/>surprise, by a body of Indians, who were con<lb break="no"/>cealed in the thickets on every side of a large <lb/>plain; and on the first onset the militia, without <lb/>exchanging a single fire, made a most precipitate <lb/>retreat, and left the regular troops to stand the <lb/>whole charge of the Indians; the conflict was <lb/>short and bloody; the troops were soon overpower<lb break="no"/>ed by numbers, and all fell, except the two offi<lb break="no"/>ers and two or three privates, after defending <lb/>themselves at their bayonet points with the great<lb break="no"/>est possible obstinacy. Ensign Hartshorn, of <lb/>Franklin, was one of the four that escaped, and <lb/>his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly <lb/>circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat, <lb/>and by that means screening himself from the eye <lb/>of his pursuers, that from any other circumstance. <lb/>Captain Armstrong, who commanded the party, <lb/>likewise made his escape, by plunging himself in<lb break="no"/>to a pond or swamp, up to his neck, within two <lb/>hundred yards of the field of action, where he re<lb break="no"/>mained the whole night, as a spectator of the hor<lb break="no"/>rid scene of the War Dance, performed over the <lb/>dead and wounded bodies of the poor soldiers that <lb/>had fallen the preceding day, where their shrieks, <lb/>mixed with the horrid yells of the savages, ren<lb break="no"/>dered his situation shocking. After this, some <lb/>few skirmishes succeeded, but nothing material, <lb/>until the second capital action, which happened <lb/>two days after the army left the Miami village. <lb/>At ten miles distance from the town, the Gene<lb break="no"/>ral ordered a halt, and detached from four to five <lb/>hundred militia, and about sixty regular soldiers, <lb/>commanded by Major Wylls, all under the com<lb break="no"/>mand of Col. Harden, with orders to march back <lb/>to the town. On their first entrance into the <lb/>town, there appeared a small body of Indians, <lb/>who immediately fled at the first onset, and by <lb/>that means decoyed the whole body of militia, by <lb/>making their flight into different directions, and <lb/>encouraging the militia to pursue; by this means <lb/>the regular troops were left alone, and the Indi<lb break="no"/>ans had effected their design; for the moment <lb/>they found the small handful of regular troops de<lb break="no"/>tached from the main body of militia, they com<lb break="no"/>menced the attack with their whole force, except<lb break="no"/>ing the flying parties that had diverted the mili<lb break="no"/>tia; and although they soon found some part of <lb/>the militia returning on their back, pursued their <lb/>object of routing and destroying the troops; as <cb/>the only sure plan of success; which, after the bloody <lb/>conflict on each side, they effect. The regular <lb/>troops, all to nine, including two commissioned <lb/>officers, were killed and disabled, and a total de<lb break="no"/>feat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls, <lb/>of Hartford, and Lieut. Frothingham, of Mid<lb break="no"/>dletown. Of the militia, it is said, about an hun<lb break="no"/>dred were killed, among whom were a number <lb/>of brave and valuable characters. The Indians, <lb/>it appears, from some cause, did not think it pru<lb break="no"/>dent to pursue their successes from the field of ac<lb break="no"/>tion, for most of the troops that were not killed, <lb/>or sorely wounded, made their escape, which they <lb/>never could have done had the Indians pursued <lb/>with their usual fury.</p>
                <p>"Nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the <lb/>Indians on this occasion; the militia they appear<lb break="no"/>ed to despise, and with all the undautedness <lb/>conceivable, threw down their guns, and rushed <lb/>upon the bayonets of the regular soldiers; a great <lb/>number of them fell; but being so far superior in <lb/>numbers soon overpowered them, for while the <lb/>poor soldier had his bayonet in one Indiaman, <lb/>two more would sink their tomahawks in his head. <lb/>The defeat of our troops was complete, the dead <lb/>and wounded were left on the field in possession <lb/>of the savages.</p>
                <p>"No damage, of any consequence, has been <lb/>sustained in this part of the country from the In<lb break="no"/>dians; but what effect the expedition may have <lb/>on us, as relates to our frontier, it uncertain.– <lb/>If the Western Indians have any idea of treating <lb/>for peace, we shall be safe; if not, we are much <lb/>exposed."</p>

                <p>On Monday the 12th ult. there was a violent <lb/>tempest at Leominster, Massachusetts, attended <lb/>with hail which was of such a size, and fell with <lb/>such velocity, that the stoutest Indian corn was <lb/>beaten into shreds–vast quantities of apples were <lb/>beaten from the trees–not only the fruit but the <lb/>trees received great injury, the bark being brok<lb break="no"/>en from their limbs; the windows broken in the <lb/>house, and the fences renewed such impressions, <lb/>as to be discovered at 90 yards distance. Many <lb/>of the hailstones were as large as hens eggs–the <lb/>common size was a little more than an inch in di<lb break="no"/>ameter. Twenty-give hours after it fell, banks <lb/>of it were measured at the foot of a hill, and <lb/>found to be 20 inches deep.</p>
                <p>The Saturday following great damage was <lb/>

               <lb/>On Sunday the 25th July, a violent hail storm <lb/>commenced a few miles to the westward of Wil<lb break="no"/>mington, Delaware, which did great damage to <lb/>many fields of grain, and blew down, in many <lb/>places, an immense quantity of timber. The <lb/>hail in this storm was of an extraordinary appear<lb break="no"/>ance; part of it being about two inches long, <lb/>and of a very considerable circumference.</p>
                <p>On Saturday, the 1st inst. arrived at Wilming<lb break="no"/>ton, Delaware, the brig Maria, Capt. fort, from <lb/>Londonderry, with 200 passengers.</p>
                <p>On the 4th inst. arrived at Philadelphia, the <lb/>Happy Return, Capt. Ewing, in 8 weeks <lb/>from Londonderry, brought 340 passengers in <lb/>good health: Capt. Ewing parted, near the <lb/>Capes of Delaware, with the ship Sally, Capt. <lb/>Miller, with passengers from Londonderry for <lb/>that port also.</p>

               <lb/>Last Sunday evening Mr. John Garrison, son <lb/>of William Garrison, of Newbury township, in <lb/>this county, was killed by lightning in his own <lb/>house. The lightning struck in at the gable and <lb/>just at the instant that Mr. Garrison was in the <lb/>centre of the floor, walking towards the window; <lb/>his brother was standing within two yards of him <lb/>when he fell, but providentially received not the <lb/>smallest hurt.</p>

               <lb/>tion on being able to repeat my congratulations <lb/>on the favourable prospects which continue to di<lb break="no"/>tinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits <lb/>of another year have blessed our country with plen<lb break="no"/>ty, and with the means of flourishing commerce. <lb/>The progress of the public credit is witnessed by <lb/>a considerable rise of American stock abroad, as <lb/>well as at home; and the revenues allotted for <lb/>this and other national purposes, have been pro<lb break="no"/>ductive beyond the calculation by which they were <lb/>regulated. This latter circumstance is the more <lb/>pleasing, as it is not only a proof the fertility of <lb/>our resources, but as it assures us of a further in<lb break="no"/>crease of the national respectability and credit; <lb/>and let me add, as it bears an honourable testi<lb break="no"/>mony to the patriotism and integrity of the ma<lb break="no"/>rine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the <lb/>former in discharging their engagements has <lb/>been exemplary.</p>
                <p>"In conforming to the power vested in me <lb/>by acts of the last session, a loan of 3,000,,000 of <lb/>florins, towards which some provisional measures <lb/>had previously taken place, has been completed <lb/>in Holland.–As well the<supplied reason="copy blur">exchange</supplied> with which it <lb/>has been filled, as the nature of the terms (consi<lb break="no"/>dering the more than ordinary demand for bor<lb break="no"/>rowing, created by the situation of Europe) give <lb/>a reasonable hope that the further execution of <lb/>those powers, may proceed with advantage and <lb/>success. The secretary of the treasure has my <lb/>direction to communicate such further particu<lb break="no"/>lars as may be requisite for more precise infor<lb break="no"/>mation.</p>
                <p>"Since your last sessions, I have received commu<lb break="no"/>nication, by which it appears, that the district <lb/>of Kentucke, at present a part of Virginia, has <lb/>concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state, in consequence of which the dis<lb break="no"/>trict is to become a distinct number of the Uni<lb break="no"/>on; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be <lb/>added. For this sanction application is now made. <lb/>I shall cause the papers on this very important <lb/>transaction to be laid before you. The liberality <lb/>and harmony with which it has been conducted, <lb/>will be found to do great honour to both the par<lb break="no"/> 
               <cb/>ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of <lb/>the Union and its present Government, expres<lb break="no"/>sed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke, cannot <lb/>fail to add an affectionate concern for their par<lb break="no"/>ticular welfare, to the great national impressions <lb/>under which you will declare on the case sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to you.</p>
                <p>"It has been heretofore known to Congress <lb/>that frequent incursions have been made on our <lb/>frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians <lb/>from the north west side of the Ohio. These, <lb/>with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the <lb/>Wabash, have of late been particularly active in <lb/>their depredations; and, being emboldened by <lb/>the impunity of their crimes, and aided by such <lb/>parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be se<lb break="no"/>duced to join in their hostilities, or afford them <lb/>a retreat for their prisoners, and plunder, they <lb/>have, instead of listening to the humane invitati<lb break="no"/>ons and overtures made on the part of the Unit<lb break="no"/>ed States, renewed their violence with fresh ala<lb break="no"/>crity and greater effect–The lives of a number of <lb/>valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed, and <lb/>some of them under circumstances peculiarly <lb/>shocking, whilst others have been carried into a <lb/>deplorable captivity.</p>
                <p>"These aggravated provocations rendered it es<lb break="no"/>sential to the safety of the western settlements, <lb/>that the aggressors should be made sensible that the <lb/>government of the Union is not less capable of <lb/>punishing their crimes, than it is disposed to <lb/>respect their rights and rewards their attachments. <lb/>As this object could not be effected by defensive <lb/>measures, it became necessary to put in force the <lb/>act which empowers the President to call out the <lb/>militia for the protection of the frontiers; and <lb/>I have accordingly authorised an expedition, in <lb/>which the regular troops in that quarter are com<lb break="no"/>bined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. <lb/>The event of the measure is yet unknown to me, <lb/>The Secretary at War is directed to lay before <lb/>you a statement of the information on which it <lb/>is founded, as well as an estimate of the expence <lb/>with which it will be attended.</p>
                <p>The disturbed situation of Europe, and parti<lb break="no"/>cularly the critical posture of the great maritime <lb/>powers, whilst it ought to make us more thank<lb break="no"/>ful for the general peace and security enjoyed by <lb/>the United States, reminds us at the same time <lb/>of the circumspection with which it becomes us <lb/>to preserve these blessings. It requires also that <lb/>we should not overlook the tendency of a war, <lb/>and even of preparations for war among the na<lb break="no"/>tions most concerned in active commerce with <lb/>this country, to abridge in means, and there <lb/>by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable <lb/>productions to their proper markets. I recom<lb break="no"/>mend it to your serious reflections, how far and <lb/>in what mode it may be expedient to guard a<lb break="no"/>gainst embarrassments from these contingencies, <lb/>by such encouragements to ur own navigation <lb/>as will render our commerce andagriculture less <lb/>dependant of foreign bottoms, which may fail us <lb/>in the moments most interesting to both of these <lb/>great objects. Our fisheries and the transporta<lb break="no"/>tion of our own produce, offers us abundant means <lb/>for guarding ourselves against this evil.</p>
                <p>"Your attention seems to be not less due to <lb/>that particular branch of our trade which belongs <lb/>to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances <lb/>unite in rendering the present state of it destres<lb break="no"/>ful to us, that you will not think any deliberations <lb/>misemployed which may lead to its relief and <lb/>protection.</p>
                <p>"The laws you have already passed for the esta<lb break="no"/>blishment of a judiciary system, have opened the <lb/>doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. <lb/>You will consider in your wisdom, whether im<lb break="no"/>provement of a judicatory system, have opened <lb/>the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. <lb/>Yu will consider in your wisdom, whether im<lb break="no"/>
               <pb n="3"/> provements in that system may yet be made, and <lb/>particularly whether<supplied reason="copy blur">??? ???</supplied>process of exe<lb break="no"/>cution on sentences issuing from the Federal <lb/>Courts, be not desirable through all the States.</p>
                <p>"The patronage of our commerce, of our <lb/>merchants and seamen, has called for the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems <lb/>expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that <lb/>jurisdiction and those functions which are permit<lb break="no"/>ted them, either by express convention, or by a <lb/>friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. <lb/>The Consular Convention too, with his most <lb/>Christian Majesty, has stipulated in certain cases, <lb/>the aid of the National authority to his Consuls <lb/>established here. Some legislative provision is re<lb break="no"/>quisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.</p>
                <p>"The establishment of the Militia, of a Mint, <lb/>of Standards of Weights and Measures, of the <lb/>Post Office and Post Roads, are subjects which <lb/>(I presume) you will resume of course, and which <lb/>are abundantly urged by their own importance.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen of the House of Representatives</hi>, <lb/>"The sufficiency of the revenues you have es<lb break="no"/>tablished for the objects to which they are appro<lb break="no"/>priated, leaves no doubt that the residuary provi<lb break="no"/>sions will be commensurate to the other objects <lb/>for which the public faith stands now pledged. <lb/>Allow me moreover to hope, that it will be a <lb/>favourite policy with you, not merely to secure a <lb/>payment of the interest of the debt founded, but <lb/>as far and as fast as the growing resources of the <lb/>country will permit, to exonerate it of the prin<lb break="no"/>cipal itself. The appropriation you have made <lb/>of the western lands explain your dispositions on <lb/>this subject, and I am persuaded the sooner that <lb/>valuable fund can be made to contribute, along <lb/>with other means, to the actual reduction of the <lb/>public debt, the more salutary will the measure <lb/>be toe very public interest, as well as be more <lb/>satisfactory to our constituents.</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen of the Senate, and House of Re<lb break="no"/>presentatives</hi>.</p>

               <pb n="6"/> The following, it is said, are the authentic <lb/>particulars of General St Clair's expedition in <lb/>America. The Miamis Indians had been for a <lb/>long time extremely troublesome to the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans, and it was determined to drive them to the <lb/>back country. General St. Clair completely ac<lb break="no"/>complished this object; but on the 22d Oct. a <lb/>detachment of 400 Americans fell in with the In<lb break="no"/>dians on the River St. Joseph, where a severe <lb/>battle was fought. Many Indians were killed, <lb/>but the Americans lost the field; several Officers, <lb/>and 150 men were killed, and they were not able <lb/>even to bring off their wounded. This success <lb/>will in all probability give the Indians new cou<lb break="no"/>rage, and induce them again to make head a<lb break="no"/>gainst the American army.</p>

                <p>"A firm peace being now, to all appearance, <lb/>secured between the United States and the Creek <lb/>Indians, we may reasonable expect that the state <lb/>of Georgia will soon begin to feel the good effects. <lb/>The immediate beneficial consequences are alrea<lb break="no"/>dy at this moment taking place. The vast tracts <lb/>of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw <lb/>river are rapidly rising in value, and nothing is <lb/>wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of <lb/>slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men, <lb/>who instead of being mere lookers on, in quality <lb/>of overseers and drivers, would condescend to put <lb/>their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe, and <lb/>make this extensive territory one of the most desir<lb break="no"/>able in the habitable world. The country round <lb/>Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw, is <lb/>one of the most beautiful you can imagine,abound<lb break="no"/>ing with everything that can make life comfort<lb break="no"/>able, besides an excellent navigation and easy bar <lb/>at the north end of Sapola, with rather more wa<lb break="no"/>ter than that of Charleston. Several vessels are <lb/>hourly looked for from France, (one in particu<lb break="no"/>lar of 800 tons from Bourdeaux) to load with live <lb/>oak ship timber and<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> in the river of St. Ma<lb break="no"/>ry's."</p>

               <lb/>"There are two articles produced in the great<lb break="no"/>est abundance on different parts adjoining James <lb/>river, the exportations of which, in the opinion of <lb/>rational men, ought to be considered as of the <lb/>greatest importance to this state. These articles <lb/>are coals, and clays for the several colours of paint, <lb/>which may be had in any quantity, and may be <lb/>afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal, <lb/>from every discovery we have been able to make, <lb/>are inexhaustible; all the samples, however, that <lb/>you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the sur<lb break="no"/>face, and there is reason to believe that the deeper <lb/>we shall descend the better will be the quality of <lb/>the coal. When once a company can be est<lb break="no"/>blished with funds sufficient to take this matter in <lb/>hand, there is no doubt but that we can supply <lb/>the different capital of the United States with <lb/>coal equally good with that from Europe, and <lb/>at a much a more moderate price than that fre<lb break="no"/>quently brought. As to our paints, there are <lb/>none better in the world, and in quantity, when <lb/>manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country <lb/>up the river, of property and enterprize, are be<lb break="no"/>ginning to turn their attention to these branches; <lb/>and with all submissions to our legislature, it is <lb/>thought that these two articles are by no means <lb/>objects beneath their attention."</p>

                <p>I had been with a number of my acquaintance <lb/>taking the diversion of a dance at an inn. The <lb/>fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the <lb/>tavern keeper came in and advised us in a very <lb/>warm manner to make a collection for the fid<lb break="no"/>dler who had been scraping his cat gut several <lb/>hours in our service; we apparently agreed, and <lb/>he well pleased with the success of his persuasion, <lb/>went for his hat to collect what we were willing <lb/>to give. We took up an old newspaper, tore it <lb/>into small pieces, which we carefully folded and <lb/>put into our pockets.

               <lb/>From Wright's Ferry we learn, that about <lb/>four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, as a boat <lb/>was coming from the East side, a most tremen<lb break="no"/>dous storm arose when she was about half way o<lb break="no"/>ver, by which means she was soon filled <lb/>with water, and sunk. there was six passengers <lb/>and the<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> in her (besides a small light <cb/>waggon and three horses, viz. a clergyman, the <lb/>owner of the waggon, with his wife and three <lb/>children; when the storm came on, the woman <lb/>and children took shelter in the waggon, but it <lb/>continued to blow with such violence that the <lb/>waggon was torn out of the boat, and the body <lb/>having by chance got loose from the carriage, <lb/>and being pretty tight, floated some distance <lb/>till its progress was stopped by a rock; the hus<lb break="no"/>band, viewing the melancholy situations of his <lb/>wife and children, resolved to relieve or perish <lb/>with them, and quitting the boat swam to the <lb/>waggon, cut open the cover with his knife, and <lb/>with difficulty kept their heads above water till <lb/>they were relieved by a boat from the West side; <lb/>by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappear<lb break="no"/>ed; the Clergyman just as he found the boat <lb/>sinking mounted his horse, one of the boatmen <lb/>mounted on one of the waggon horses, and by <lb/>this means preserved themselves till they were <lb/>relieved by a boat; the other boatman of the <lb/>name of Tim Sulivan, depending on his skill in <lb/>swimming got up an oar, but it is thought <lb/>he is drowned, as he has not since been heard <lb/>of; the boat was found in the falls, and one of <lb/>the waggon horses that had been given up for <lb/>lost, was found next day some distance below the <lb/>falls, with all his geers on, and does not appear <lb/>to have received the least injury.</p>

                <p>"One of the men who murdered the Indians <lb/>at Pine Creek, was tried on Saturday evening, <lb/>and though a number of witnesses clearly proved <lb/>the hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed, <lb/>and the confession of his counsel at the bar that <lb/>confirmed it, yet, notwithstanding an express <lb/>charge from the judges to bring him in guilty, <lb/>the jury in a few moments returned with a verdict <lb/>in his favour, and a subscription to pay the costs <lb/>of the suit, that he might be immediately set at <lb/>liberty; and all this from a most absurd idea, <lb/>which the Attorney General, with all his endea<lb break="no"/>vours, could not beat out of them, that the crime <lb/>was not the same to kill an Indian as a white <lb/>man: for some minuets the Chief Justice was mute <lb/>with astonishment. How the State can pacify <lb/>the Indians now, Heaven knows, while at this <lb/>moment the other murderers are at large in this <lb/>country, and no one will arrest them."</p>

               <pb n="2"/> The brig Virginia Planter, James Merrifield, <lb/>Master, arrived at Liverpool, brings information <lb/>that on the 5th of May, General Wayne, with <lb/>two thousand provincials, had attacked to<lb break="no"/>tally destroyed most of the Indian towns at the <lb/>back of Georgia, for near two hundred miles a<lb break="no"/>round the river. That M'Gilvray, and his ar<lb break="no"/>my of savages, after an unsuccessful and bloody <lb/>engagement, had fled to the woods, where the <lb/>General left them, and returned to Savannah.– <lb/>This expedition was undertaken about the begin<lb break="no"/>ning of March, winch has been crowned with the <lb/>expected catastrophe, and though the Cherokee, <lb/>Miami, and Chiquesaw tribes, may mediate re<lb break="no"/>venge at some future period; it is not likely they <lb/>will be in a condition to disturb the settlers for <lb/>some years to come.</p>

                <p>For several days last week the weather at the <lb/>north side, and in some of the Liguanea Moun<lb break="no"/>tains blew in most alarming gusts, and the cold <lb/>is said to have been peculiarly sever; some plan<lb break="no"/>tain trees have been thrown down, but we have <lb/>yet heard of no material damage.</p>

               <pb n="1"/> The laws of the State of Pennsylvania, and that of <lb/>Massachusetts, by which the punishment of death is abo<lb break="no"/>lished, in all cases except for wilful murder, are about <lb/>to be adopted by the respective Legislatures of all the <lb/>other States. The system of the great and merciful<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>
               <lb break="no"/>caria, has taken place of the sanguinary Penal laws of <lb/>England.</p>
                <p>The abolition of Negro slavery, which has taken shape <lb/>in the five New England States of New Hampshire, <lb/>Massachusets, Rhode island, Connecticut, and Vermont; <lb/>in the Midland States of New York, New Jersey, Penn<lb break="no"/>sylvania, and Delawar; and in the Western State of <lb/>Kentucky, for several years past is now extended, by act <lb/>of Congress to the Southern States of Virginia, North <lb/>Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Maryland; and <lb/>the emancipation of the remainder of that unfortunate <lb/>race of men is to take place on or before the fifth of No<lb break="no"/>vember, 1795.</p>
                <p>The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts has g<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>
               <lb break="no"/>ed a part of the public lands to the emancipated Negroes <lb/>of that State, in proportion to the numbers of the re<lb break="no"/>spective families, where the liberal and philanthropic <lb/>mind is gratified, by seeing them erect villages cultivate <lb/>farms, and form communities of civilized Societies.</p>
                <p>Before the Gentleman, who has favoured us with this <lb/>Intelligence, left America, they had established a Lodge <lb/>of Masonry; and he had the satisfaction of seeing them <lb/>on a grand day, parade to Church in all the magnifi<lb break="no"/>cence of the Order, where a sermon was preached, on <lb/>the occasion, by one of their own colour. They have <lb/>also endowed public schools, employed<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> and <lb/>erected places of Public Worship.</p>
                <p>The Officers, Non-commissioned Officers, and Soldiers, <lb/>who served in the Continental army and established the <lb/>Liberty of their Country, have at last received a reward, <lb/>infinitely beyond their expectations, but every way cor<lb break="no"/>responding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic.</p>
                <p>Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Con<lb break="no"/>gress, this last Session, to each individual, who served <lb/>throughout the war; and to the defendants of those <lb/>who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature, and e<lb break="no"/>equal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; <lb/>and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real <lb/>value, to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran, as has <lb/>been the case of former grants, he is allowed his option <lb/>of taking its value in sterling money, at the present <lb/>market price, from the Treasure of the States; or any <lb/>part in land, and the rest in money,a s may be most <lb/>agreeable to the receiver.</p>
                <p>The Mint of the United States, which was establish<lb break="no"/>ed two years since, has begun to issue its hold and silver <lb/>coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The <lb/>gold coins are eagles, half eagles, and quarter eagles.</p>
                <p>The first is exactly five and forty shillings, English <lb/>money, or ten American coin.</p>
                <p>The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half, <lb/>and quater, which makes the courie of exchange simple, <lb/>and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Read<lb break="no"/>ers will perceive, that ten quarter dollars make the quar<lb break="no"/>ter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dol<lb break="no"/>lars the eagle.</p>
                <p>There is, besides, one more silver coin, which is cal<lb break="no"/>led a Dime, and is the tenth part of a dollar.</p>
                <p>The copper coin is called a Cent, and is the tenth <lb/>part of a Dime.</p>
                <p>Six of the ships of war, which were voted by Con<lb break="no"/>gress in November last, are completed and put in com<lb break="no"/>mission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by <lb/>Midsummer next, and will complete a fleet of<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> 
               <lb/>hundred guns.</p>
                <p>The city of Washington, which in five years more <lb/>will be the Capital of the United States, will in every <lb/>respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Con<lb break="no"/>gress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence, and <lb/>c<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> a full and complete view of every part of <lb/>the city, as well as a considerable extent of the country <lb/>around. The President's house likewise stands upon a <lb/>rising ground near the banks of the Potamac, possessing <lb/>a delightful water prospect, together with a commanding <lb/>view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the <lb/>city.</p>
                <p>From the President's house to the Capitol, run two <lb/>great pleasure parks or malls, which intersect and ter<lb break="no"/>minate upon the banks of the Potomac, and are orna<lb break="no"/>mented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Mi<lb break="no"/>nisters. The four fronts of the Capitol, as well as those <lb/>of the President's house, are of the finest marble. The <lb/>building of these superb edifices has been much retarded <lb/>by the want of stone cutters, masons, bricklayers, car<lb break="no"/>penters, and blacksmiths, who at this time actually re<lb break="no"/>ceive the enormous wages of ten shillings American <lb/>currency per day.</p>
                <p>The district of Country at the back of North Caro<lb break="no"/>lina, reaching to the Mississippi, and covering a country <lb/>six hundred miles long by three hundred broad, is next <lb/>winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the <lb/>Province of Maine, extending from the borders of New <lb/>Hampshire to the river St. Croix, is expected to form a <lb/>Seventeenth.</p>
                <p>The new cities build in America since her indepen<lb break="no"/>dence are Grenville, in the State of Georgia; Marten<lb break="no"/>berg, the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia, the <lb/>Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and Nashville, in <lb/>the Tenesee Settlements; Danville, Fairfield, and Lex<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ington, in the State of Kentucky; Washington, the <lb/>Capital of the United States; Sunbury, in the State of <lb/>Pennsylvania; Hudson, upon Husdon's River, and Coo<lb break="no"/>per's Town, in the State of New York; Bennington, in <lb/>the State of Vermont; and Paterson, in the State of <lb/>New Jersey. All the towns burnt by the English in the <lb/>was, have been rebuilt, and the old cities of Charlestown, <lb/>Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, have <lb/>been extended to more than double the extent they had <lb/>before the peace.</p>
                <p>The population of the United States, by the last Cen<lb break="no"/>sus in 1790, was more than double what it was in 1775, <lb/>by which it appears, that America doubles her number <lb/>of people every fifteen years. The emigrations from <lb/>the different nations in Europe to that country, are esi<lb break="no"/>mated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually. The <lb/>increase of farms and villages has been so great as to <lb/>people four new States, and to extend their Settlements <lb/>from the Atlantic to the Ohio in the South, and from <lb/>the Atlantic to the Lakes on the River St. Lawrence in <lb/>the North.</p>

               <pb n="6"/>Letters from Alexandria, in Virginia, dated <lb/>the 9th May last, mention, that General Wayne <lb/>had been dispatched, in the beginning of March, <lb/>on an expedition against the Cherokee Miamis <lb/>and Chickesau Indians, who have, for some time <lb/>past, had as their chief warrior, one Macgillivray, <lb/>a Scotchman, who has long resided among these <lb/>Indians. General Wayne, at the head of two <lb/>thousand Provincials, had completely routed them <lb/>after a great slaughter. After the battle, Mac<lb break="no"/>gillivray and his savages took refuge in the woods. <lb/>General Wayne has destroyed the most part of <lb/>the habitation of these Indians in the extent of <lb/>200 English miles along the river, which is the <lb/>boundary of Georgia, after which he returned to <lb/>Savannah. This defeat is so total, that it will put <lb/>it out of the power of these Indians to be again <lb/>troublesome to the State of Virginia.</p>

               <pb n="3"/>The American States having now gained their <lb/>independence, have no cause of quarrel let with <lb/>this country; but matters are very different be<lb break="no"/>tween them and Spain. It is well known, that <lb/>the Indians on the back settlements have been <lb/>regularly supplied with arms and ammunition <cb/>from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies, <lb/>to enable them to distress the Americans, and <lb/>prove at least a hindrance to their growing pro<lb break="no"/>sperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi <lb/>has been denied them?and the Spaniards, now <lb/>in possession of the Floridas, have been continual<lb break="no"/>ly quarrelling with them about their boundaries.</p>
                <p>It may therefore be considered as almost cer<lb break="no"/>tain, that the American states will take an active <lb/>part against Spain. This will be a great acquisi<lb break="no"/>tion to Britain in every point of view; for though <lb/>American cannot furnish money, she can furnish <lb/>men and provisions; and afree intercourse with <lb/>her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the <lb/>security of our West-India Islands. Their pri<lb break="no"/>vateers, too, will be able to take their runs so <lb/>speedily, that the Spanish trade must be very <lb/>materially injured thereby.</p>

                <p>A very severe shock of an earthquake was felt <lb/>between give and six on the evening of last Thurs<lb break="no"/>day se'ennight, at the settlements near the Blue <lb/>Mountains.</p>

It is a well known fact, <lb/>that they are regularly supplied with cloathing, <lb/>arms and ammunition, from the Royal Maga<lb break="no"/>zines at St. Augustine and Pensacola, and there<lb break="no"/>fore in all probability; the sword not the olive <lb/>branch, will be the most speedy and effectual <lb/>agent for terminating the disputes.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">March</hi>  6.

                <p>Colonel Hunter is appointed superintendent of <lb/>the settlement at the Bay of Honduras, in the <lb/>room of Colonel Despard, recalled.</p>
                <p>Col. Hunter came out with the earl of Effing<lb break="no"/>ham; it is therefore probable that the dis<lb break="no"/>putes which have so long subsisted between Lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of <lb/>the Bay of Honoduras, will be brought to a speedy <lb/>determination.</p>
                <p>At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's e<lb break="no"/>state,a negro blacksmith was sold for the extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary sum of two hundred and sixty pounds!</p>
                <p>At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d <lb/>regiment quitted the barracks in this town and <lb/>at Up Park Camp, and embarked on board the <lb/>Chichester for Great Britain; the 14th at the <lb/>same time taking possession of their quarters.</p>
                <p>Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispani<lb break="no"/>ola, that, on the 1st of this month, a number of <lb/>free people of colour, to the amount of 700 and <lb/>upwards, having possessed themselves of several <lb/>field pieces, formed a camp in that districh, and <lb/>exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarm<lb break="no"/>ing. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent <lb/>from the Assembly to demand the reason of so <lb/>extraordinary a proceeding, the insurgents de<lb break="no"/>manded, that a remonstrance which they then <lb/>delivered to the deputies, should be presented im<lb break="no"/>immediately to the general, and that an answer <lb/>thereto should be given without delay. The pa<lb break="no"/>per being conveyed as they desired, proved to be <lb/>a sensible and well written detail of the various <lb/>claims the free people of colour had on what they <lb/>termed the justice of the whites, with whom they <lb/>demanded an equal participation of all rights and <pb n="3"/> immunities whatsoever–the privilege of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation, and of qualifying for all the learned <lb/>professions–and concluding with the avowal of <lb/>a determination to proceed to extremities should <lb/>their demands be treat with neglect.</p>
                <p>On the perusal of this paper, it was judged ad<lb break="no"/>viseable to assemble a body of the militia, who <lb/>headed by the General, immediately went against <lb/>the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired <lb/>and fled to the mountains; three or four of the <lb/>whites were killed, and one of the ringleaders was <lb/>taken and instantly beheaded.</p>
                <p>A proclamation was then issued, offering a re<lb break="no"/>ward of 50 half joes for the head of any principal <lb/>offender, and in the course of a few days not less <lb/>than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday <lb/>the 7th instant, a very great majority of those <lb/>who had formed the camp, finding all their at<lb break="no"/>tempts completely frustrated, came in and took <lb/>the oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two <lb/>of the principals, for whom high rewards are of<lb break="no"/>fered, are not yet taken.</p>
                <p>From Port Maria we have received the disagree<lb break="no"/>able account of the loss of the ship Lion, Capt. <lb/>Smith, belonging to Liverpool: a violent breeze <lb/>on the 5th instant drove her from her anchors, <lb/>and she now lies stranded on the beach.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">NOOTKA SOUND.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>The circumstances of thetrade and situation <lb/>of this part of North America being a matter of <lb/>such general conversation and great public mo<lb break="no"/>ment, we are particularly happy in being enabled <lb/>to give some further account of the transactions, <lb/>that have happened at Nootka Sounds, as well as <lb/>to point out the advantages that were likely to <lb/>be extended to other places by the means of this <lb/>trade.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to remark that the skin of the <lb/>sea otter is worn only in the Northern regions of <lb/>China. Its fur, though beautiful and magnifi<lb break="no"/>cent, is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of <lb/>the Southern Provinces.</p>
                <p>Pekin is, therefore, the proper mart for this <lb/>valuable commodity, and in this immense city, <lb/>the consumption is so great, that the produce of <lb/>the voyage meets and immediate sale.</p>
                <p>The Mandarins of the Court, and even the <lb/>Emperor himself, are fond of wearing this costly <lb/>fur. To a citizen of common rank, a sea otter's <lb/>collar to his vestment is a luxury.</p>
                <p>The natives of the North West Coast of Ame<lb break="no"/>erica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds, <lb/>that all the blankets, cloths, hats, and stockings, <lb/>that could be procured in China, if English ma<lb break="no"/>nufacture, were sold to the Indians, with whose <lb/>Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed.</p>
                <p>An act of cruelty committed by an officer of <lb/>the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to <lb/>be recorded.</p>
                <p>The Spaniards discovering that Callicum, a <lb/>Chief, second in authority at Nootka Sound, was <lb/>in alliance with the English, he was shot through <lb/>the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife <lb/>of Callicum, with an infant child, escaped, but <lb/>not till wounded.</p>
                <p>Macquilla, the Chief, first in command, re<lb break="no"/>tired at the head of the allies of England, from <lb/>Nootka Sound, and to avoid the cruelty of the <lb/>Spaniards, they fled to distant parts. Such of <lb/>the natives as they could seize, the Spaniards <lb/>condemned to work as slaves on their fortifica<lb break="no"/>tions.</p>
                <p>At this period it was in the contemplation of <lb/>the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands, with <lb/>a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. <lb/>And we further add, on authority that amounts <lb/>nearly to demonstration, that on the very lands <lb/>purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain <lb/>Mears, the Spaniards have already opened valuable <lb/>mines.</p>
                <p>Another object of this enterprise wasto sup<lb break="no"/>ply the markets of Kamschatka, and other ports <lb/>belonging to the Russians, with the teas and other <lb/>produce of China. This promised to be an in<lb break="no"/>valuable channel of commerce, as the Chinese <lb/>have shut their ports against the Russians, who <lb/>
            </p>
                <p>On this voyage of discovery and experiment, <lb/>one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo, <lb/>but was unfortunately lost on her return to China.</p>
                <p>To these curious particulars we add, with a <lb/>patriot joy, that the consumption of the glorious <lb/>staple of England, her broad cloths, is astonish<lb break="no"/>ingly great in Japan and China: British hard<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ware, &amp;c. is also in great request.</p>
                <p>From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears, <lb/>ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may <lb/>depend on the utmost attention and civility. <lb/>This Prince is six feet 4 1/2 inches high, of propor<lb break="no"/>tionate bulk.</p>

                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Extract of a letter from a Gentleman at Kentucky,  <lb/>to a Member of the General Assembly, dated,  <lb/>Nov</hi>. 7, 1790.</p>
                <p>"I have been waiting with much impatience <lb/>to obtain some certain account of our troops; <lb/>many probably conjectures still fill the minds of the <lb/>people. A hand-bill just come to Bourbon, con<lb break="no"/>tains an extract of a letter from Governor St. <cb/>Clair to General Wilkinson, which mentions that <lb/>our army had met with but little opposition. The <lb/>Miami villages were abandoned, from thence a <lb/>detachment was sent up to St. Joseph's river, <lb/>which fell in with a party of Indians, and had a <lb/>severe engagement.</p>
                <p>"General Harmar made a shew of retreating, <lb/>and marched about eight miles, when he detached <lb/>a strong party to the field of action, in hopes of <lb/>finding the Indians on the ground; as they ex<lb break="no"/>pected, so they found them, and an action imme<lb break="no"/>diately commenced, which was obstinate on both <lb/>sides.</p>
                <p>"A vast number of Indians were killed in <lb/>crossing the St. Joseph's river. Major Fountain, <lb/>of Fayette, and General Scott's son were killed <lb/>the second fire; Capt. M'Murty and 73 militia<lb break="no"/>men were killed; Major Willis, Lieut. Fother<lb break="no"/>ingham, of the F–deral troops, and 77 privates, <lb/>also fell in the action.</p>
                <p>"General Harmar did not send a single man <lb/>to reinforce the detachment, consisting of 400 <lb/>men, (who had to sustain the fire of the whole <lb/>Indian army) although he had with him in camp <lb/>upwards of 1100 men. Our men at last lost <lb/>ground, Colonel Harding's wing was beaten, and <lb/>finally broke. Lieutenant Colonel Hall, of Bour<lb break="no"/>bon, and Majors M'Million and Willis broke the <lb/>other wing of the Indians, which occasioned the <lb/>amazing slaughter in the river St. Joseph.</p>
                <p>"General Harmar never sent to bring off the <lb/>wounded, nor bury the dead. Captain David <lb/>Thrope and Lieut. Clark fell in the field. The <lb/>Bourbon militia has suffered very much, nearly <lb/>one third of them having fallen on the spot.</p>
                <p>"The army is now at Licking, and is ex<lb break="no"/>pected home hourly.</p>
                <p>"This is the best account that I have been <lb/>able to collect; it will be delivered to you by <lb/>Major Jones, who before he leaves the district, <lb/>may be enabled to obtain further particulars."</p>

               <lb/>Intelligence has been received, that in some <lb/>trivial dispute with a native Indian, a Spaniard <lb/>has stabbed him to the heart with a stiletto, and <lb/>then fled. The nation to whom the Indian be<lb break="no"/>longed, being made acquainted with the murder, <lb/>sent a deputation to the Governor, demanding <lb/>that five Spaniards should be instantly delivered <lb/>up as an attonement. This was peremptorily re<lb break="no"/>fused, as being more than commensurate to the <lb/>offence, but the murderer was offered as a satis<lb break="no"/>faction; the Indians would not accept him singly, <lb/>and departed, vowing the severest revenge: a <lb/>few days afterwards intelligence was received that <lb/>they had surprised and massacred sixteen men, <lb/>who had been at work in the woods; and when <lb/>the vessel departed, the Spaniards were flying, <lb/>with the utmost precipitation and terror, from <lb/>all parts of the country, seeking shelter in the <lb/>forts.</p>

                <p>"I wrote to you from Fort Pitt, which place <lb/>we left the 3d. inst. in company with two other <lb/>boats, and proceeded to Limestone, without <lb/>meeting or apprehending danger–at that place <lb/>we were informed of several disasters which had <lb/>befallen boats going down the river, and one to <lb/>a boat going up to a French station, loaded with <lb/>bacon, butter, &amp;c. The particulars relative to <lb/>the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked <lb/>by about 60 or 70 Indians, and the flankets that <lb/>were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. <lb/>–Immediately after firing, they gave the Indian <lb/>whoop, and rushing on the flankets, scalped them <lb/>every one (about 22)– they then fired at the <lb/>boat, but did no damage, as it required some <lb/>time to make their way into the river. After <lb/>the savages had executed this terrible act of bar<lb break="no"/>barity, they continued on the river watching for <lb/>other boats. In the course of about six days, five <lb/>or six boats happened to come down the river–the <lb/>savages attacked the foremost of them, in which <lb/>were two young ladies, of the name Macdonald, <lb/>a young gentleman, and some others, passengers, <lb/>and took it. Elevated with this easy capture, <lb/>they imagined themselves capable of taking every <lb/>boat they might fall in with–In a little time a <lb/>second boat hove in fight, which they attacked <lb/>with great fury–they were in three canoes, each <lb/>canoe containing about twenty–they moved to<lb break="no"/>wards the boat, as it came down, and commenced <lb/>firing; after discharging their guns, they retreat<lb break="no"/>ed, loading and came on a second time, fired and <lb/>repeated nine different times; as often as they <lb/>come on, there was a brisk firing kept up from <lb/>the boat, which contained nine fighting men;– <lb/>during the conflict two were killed, and five <lb/>wounded; two only remained to protect the boat, <lb/>and prevent the Indians from boarding it, which <lb/>every appearance of their conduct plainly indi<lb break="no"/>cated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves <lb/>in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the <lb/>
               <supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>, they threw billets of wood at them, and <lb/>one of them took up an ax, as a weapon of de<lb break="no"/>fence, should they persist in boarding, which the <lb/>Indians perceiving, and, as is supposed, their <lb/>ammunition being expended, they retreated, <lb/>without accomplishing their object.</p>
                <p>"These inhuman monsters, previous to their <lb/>attacking the last mentioned boat, placed the <lb/>two young ladies in front of their canoes, <lb/>in which situation they were both killed. A few <lb/>days after this transaction, they fired at another <lb/>boat, and killed one young man. In short, every <lb/>boat tat has gone down the river lately, has <lb/>been fired at, except our's. We saw no Indians; <lb/>the places where the above depredation happen<lb break="no"/>ed we passed in the night."</p>

               <lb/>of St. John's Lodge, No. 2 of Newbern, beg <lb/>leave to hail you welcome with <hi rend="smallcaps">three times  <lb/>three</hi> !

                <p>But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to <lb/>express with sufficient energy, the cordial warmth <lb/>with which our bosoms glow towards you–We <lb/>therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and <lb/>devoutly pray, that the Providence of the Most <lb/>High, may strengthen, establish and protect you <lb/>in your walk through life–and when you are <lb/>called off from your terrestrial labours, by com<lb break="no"/>mand of our <hi rend="smallcaps">divine grand master</hi>, and your <lb/>operations sealed with the mark of his approba<lb break="no"/>tion, may <hi rend="smallcaps">your soul</hi>  be everlastingly refreshed <lb/>with the streams of living water which flow from <lb/>the right hand of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>. And when the Supreme <lb/>Architect of all world's shall collect his most pre<lb break="no"/>cious jewels, as ornaments of the Celestial Jerusa<lb break="no"/>lem–may you eternally shine among those of the <lb/>brightest lustre."</p>
                <p>To which the President returned the following <lb/>answer:– <lb/>" <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen</hi>, <lb/>"I receive the cordial welcome which you <lb/>are pleased to give me, with sincere gratitude. <lb/>My best ambition having aimed at the unbiassed <lb/>approbation of my fellow citizens, it is peculiarly <lb/>pleasing to find my conduct so affectionately ap<lb break="no"/>proved,, by a fraternity whose association is found<lb break="no"/>ed on justice and benevolence.</p>
                <p> 
               <lb/>In reciprocating the kind wishes contained in <lb/>your address, be persuaded, that I offer a <lb/>sincere prayer for your present and future happi<lb break="no"/>ness."</p>

                <p>Yesterday morning, about one or two o'clock, <lb/>the ship Termagant, belonging to the house of <lb/>Messrs. Claggen, lying in the stream opposite <lb/>this town, was discovered on fire. The inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants of the town and the seamen in the harbour <lb/>speedily collected, but on account of a quantity <lb/>of powder that was on board, the efforts that o<lb break="no"/>therwise would have been exerted to extinguish <lb/>the flames were withholden. The first soon com<lb break="no"/>municated itself to the powder; and the explosion <lb/>was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the <lb/>houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of <lb/>the ship were flying in every direction, and it <lb/>and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting, <lb/>store and dwelling houses, on the water side, were <lb/>prevented from sharing a similar fate with the <lb/>ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse, <lb/>the property of Francis and Charles Loundes, si<lb break="no"/>tuated at some distance from the water, wherein <lb/>upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stor<lb break="no"/>ed, was several times, in different places, on fire, <lb/>ut happily extinguished without sustaining much <lb/>damage. The loss, occasioned by this alarming <lb/>element, must be great indeed, as the ship was <lb/>large and nearly new; besides, there were goods <lb/>to a considerable amount, and a pretty large sum <lb/>of money on board of her: all of which (except<lb break="no"/>ing a part of the money, which has since been <lb/>found) was destroyed. We are informed that <lb/>this accident proceeded from the steward's falling <lb/>to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cab<lb break="no"/>bin, which by some means or other, set fire to <lb/>the sails that were stowed there. It had got far <lb/>advanced before it was discovered. Providenti<lb break="no"/>ally no lives were lost.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Pittsburgh, May</hi>  21. A letter received in this <lb/>town, on Sunday last, from Lieut. Jeffers, at <lb/>Fort Franklin, mentions, that an Indian had ar<lb break="no"/>rived there, who brought him intelligence that <lb/>300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations <lb/>had set out for war and that they were determin<lb break="no"/>ed to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio, near Pe<lb break="no"/>tersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing, but <lb/>their destination was not known.</p>

               <pb n="6"/> By private letters and newspapers lately arrived <lb/>from Philadelphia and New York we have inform<lb break="no"/>mation, that the Indians are carrying on their de<lb break="no"/>predations on the back settlements of the United <lb/>States with great vigour; that an enquiry as to <lb/>the miscarriage of the war had been made by <lb/>Congress, and an army was collected this year; <lb/>that the Americans had some expectations of get<lb break="no"/>ting free of the Indian war by treaties.</p>
                <p>We have advices of Governor Clinton's being <lb/>re-elected Governor of New York state by a ma<lb break="no"/>jority of 180, but the friends of Mr. Tay were <lb/>objecting to the return, as the canvassers had not <lb/>opened the boxes which contained the returns <lb/>from three counties, Otsego, Clinton, and Tioga, <lb/>which if opened they say would have given the <lb/>election to Mr. Tay, the county of Otsego alone <lb/>being 300 majority in favours of Mr. Tay.</p>
                <p>A dreadful storm happened at New York on <lb/>the 1st of July, which continued with so much <lb/>violence, that several vessels were driven from their <lb/>moorings, and a number of boats upset and many <lb/>lives lost.</p>

               <lb/>"On Saturday the 1st of July, I left Tioga point, <lb/>near the middle of the day; about half after one <lb/>o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising from <lb/>the north west, and I had scarcely time to take <lb/>shelter in the house of Obadiah Gore, Esq; at <lb/>Sheshequen, before the storm came on, attended <lb/>with heavy thunder and lightening, and a violent <lb/>gale of wind with rain. The storm continued up<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>wards of half an hour, during which time to see <lb/>the tumbling of timber during the storm, was sur<lb break="no"/>prising. After it abated I continued on my jour<lb break="no"/>ney, but found it very difficult travelling in many <lb/>places, the road being blocked up by the falling <lb/>of timber. I reached Wilksbarree on Wednesday. <lb/>It appears that the storm extended through the <lb/>country, and at the same hour of the day, blew <lb/>more violent in some places than others. At Exe<lb break="no"/>eter, about nine miles from Wilksbarrie, a level <lb/>plain loaded with pitch pine timber, was swept of <lb/>its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile <lb/>in length, and three fourths of a mile wide, being <lb/>either torn up by the roots or twisted off, leaving <lb/>their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high.</p>
                <p>"A number of buildings in different parts of <lb/>the country stript of their roofs, and otherways <lb/>damaged–fences in many place removed, and <lb/>many fields of corn, others grain and flax laid level <lb/>with the earth–cattle killed by the falling of tim<lb break="no"/>ber in every part of the country.</p>
                <p>"A Mr. –Lot, who lived at Mahooper, <lb/>about 35 miles from Wilksbarre, whose family <lb/>consisted of his wife and a number of children– <lb/>he with his wife being absent children seeing them<lb break="no"/>selves in danger in the house, left it at the instant <lb/>a large tree was falling; the tree reached them a <lb/>small distance from the door, and a girl about e<lb break="no"/>leven years of age was crushed to pieces about expir<lb break="no"/>ed instantly. One of the other children had a <lb/>thigh and both arms broke, another badly wound<lb break="no"/>ed in the head–these two it is feared has received <lb/>the fatal blow, two other slightly wounded."</p>

                <p>"By accounts from Kentucky we are inform<lb break="no"/>ed, that about the 1st of this month a party of <lb/>Indians appeared near Frankfort, and took a great <lb/>number of horses and negroes. Col. M'Dowell with <lb/>300 men pursued them to the Ohio; but not fal<lb break="no"/>ling in with them he crossed the river, leaving 100 <lb/>men to take care of his horses; after marching <lb/>about 12 or 15 miles, overtook a large party, when <lb/>a severe engagement ensued, but being overpower<lb break="no"/>ed by numbers, was obliged to retreat. He then <lb/>sent for the men left behind, and came up with <lb/>the Indians the next day, and after engaging some <lb/>time, obliged them to make a precipitate retreat. <lb/>Col. M'Dowell took six Indian warriors, two <lb/>Englishmen and a Frenchman from Detroit, and <lb/>all the negroes and horses."</p>

               <hi rend="center">LANDS in AMERICA for SALE.</hi>
            </p>
                <p> THESE two adjoining TRACKS of LAND in the <lb/>County of FAYETTE and State of KENTUCKY. <lb/>The one track consists of 7000 acres, and is divided into <lb/>15 plantations of 500 acres each; eight of these plantations, <lb/>are still unsold, and are now offered at the low price of <lb/>137l. being only 5s. 6d. per acre. The other track coun<lb break="no"/>sists of 3086 acres, and is to be sold in one lot, at 5s. 6d. <lb/>per acre. There is a fine stream of water running through <lb/>these two tracks of land, which communicates with the <lb/>great river Ohio, so that Mills may be erect.</p>
                <p> In Fayette County is Lexington, where the Courts of the <lb/>State of Kentucky are held, and where all public business <lb/>is transacted Lexington is in the neighbourhood of these <lb/>lands, and Fayette county is the nearest and most convenient <lb/>for Philadelphia, Baltimore, City of Washington, &amp;c. The <lb/>soil of Kentucky is deep and black, and lies upon a bed of <lb/>lime-stone and coal. THe natural grown of the country <lb/>are large walnuts, honey, poplar and sugar trees. The <lb/>surface is covered with blue grass, clover, and wild rye, <lb/>grape vines running to the tops of the trees. Shrubs and <lb/>plants grow spontaneously, and afford a beautiful blossom <lb/>of a rich and exquisite fragrance. Cotton and sugar are <lb/>manufactured to advantage. wheat ,barley, oats, flax, <lb/>and hemp, yield abundantly; indeed, it is assumed that <lb/>there have been raised 100 bushels upon one acre, but the <lb/>common produce is from 40 to 60 bushels an acre.</p>
                <p> Owing to the peculiar richness of the soil, and fine cli<lb break="no"/>mate of the country, no part of America has been to re<lb break="no"/>pidly settled. The returns made to Congress, upon 1st May <lb/>1792 state them at 76 000. In March 1793, there were upwards of 100,000. And, from their astonishing increase <lb/>since, they may be estimated at 200,000. Eleven years <lb/>ago, Kentucky lay in a forest, but now she exhibits an <lb/>extensive settlement, divided into seven populous counties, in <lb/>which are a great number of flourishing towns, and con<lb break="no"/>tains more inhabitants than are in Georgia, Delaware, and <lb/>Rhode Island States. There are about 70 churches in Ken<lb break="no"/>tucky and mostly PResbyterians. There is a College; and <lb/>Schools are established in every town. There is a Print<lb break="no"/>ing-office; a Weekly Gazette published. There are Pa<lb break="no"/>per Mills, O<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> Mills,<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>ing Mills, Saw Mills, and a great <lb/>number of Grist Mills. Considerable quantities of Sugar, <lb/>are made from the Sugar Trees. Salt-works are in every <lb/>part of the country, and the inhabitants are supplied at a <lb/>low price.</p>
                <p> The taxes upon land are very low. Any person who <lb/>goes from Europe becomes an American Citizen on his ar<lb break="no"/>rival in this new State, and is entitled to be elected to any <lb/>office in the Commonwealth.</p>
                <p> For farther particulars apply to MR. John Granger, wri<lb break="no"/>ter to the signet; David Niven, writer, Glasgow; or to <lb/>Mr. John Finlayson, writer, Cupar Fife;</p>

               <pb n="2"/> As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at <lb/>the opening of the Congress of the <lb/>United States at New York, Nov. 6, gives an <lb/>impartial account of the situation of that count<lb break="no"/>try, we are persuaded it will be found not un<lb break="no"/>entertaining to our readers.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the  <lb/>House of Representatives, </hi>
               <lb/>IT is some aba<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>of the satisfaction, with <lb/>which I meet you on the present occasion, <lb/>that in felicitating you on a continuance of the <lb/>national prosperity, generally, I am not able to <lb/>add to it information that Indian hostilities, <lb/>which have for some time past, distressed our <lb/>western frontier, have terminated.</p>
                <p>You will, I am persuaded, learn, with no less <lb/>concern than I communicate it, that reiterated <lb/>endeavours, towards effecting a pacification, have <lb/>hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs <lb/>of preserving hostility on the part of the tribes <lb/>with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire <lb/>to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop <lb/>the further effusion of blood–to arrest the pro<lb break="no"/>gress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of <lb/>the nation, for peace, has led to strenuous efforts, <lb/>through various channels, to accomplish these de<lb break="no"/>sirable puposes:–In making which efforts, I <lb/>consulted less my own anticipations of the events, <lb/>or the scruples which some considerations were <lb/>calculated to inspire, than the wish to find the ob<lb break="no"/>ject attainable; to ascertain, unequivocally, the <lb/>such is the case.</p>
                <p>A detail of the measures which have been pur<lb break="no"/>sued, and of their consequences, which will be <lb/>laid before you, while it will confirm to you the <lb/>want of success, thu s far, will, I trust, evince <lb/>that means, as proper and as efficacious, as could <lb/>have been devised, have been employed. The <lb/>issue of some of them, indeed, is still depending; <lb/>but a favourable one, though not to be despaired <lb/>of, is not promised by any thing that has yet hap<lb break="no"/>pened.</p>
                <p>In the course of the attempts which have been <lb/>made, some valuable citizens have fallen victims <lb/>to their zeal for the public service. A sanction <lb/>commonly respected, even among savages, has been <lb/>found, in this instance, insufficient to protect <lb/>from massacre, the emissaries of peace; it will I <cb/>presume, be duly considered, whether the occasion <lb/>does not call for an exercise of liberality towards <lb/>the families of the deceased.</p>
                <p>It must add to your concern, to be informed, <lb/>what besides the continuation of hostile appearances <lb/>among the tribes north of the Ohio, some threat<lb break="no"/>ening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it.</p>
                <p> A part of the Cherokees, known by the name <lb/>of Chickamagas, inhabiting five villages on the <lb/>
               <supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> river, have long been in the practice of <lb/>committing depredations on the neighbouring <lb/>settlements.</p>
                <p> It was hoped that the treat of Holston, made <lb/>with the Cherokee nation, in July 1791, would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. <lb/>But the event has not answered this hope. The <lb/>Chickamagas, aided by some banditti of another <lb/>tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated <lb/>wanton and unproved hostilities, upon the ci<lb break="no"/>tizens of the United States in that quarter.</p>
                <p> I have reason to believe, that every predictable <lb/>exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision <lb/>by law for that purpose) to be prepared for <lb/>the alternative of a prosecution of the war, in the <lb/>event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large <lb/>proportion of the troops authorized to be raised, <lb/>have been recruited, though the number is still <lb/>incomplete. And pains have been taken to disci<lb break="no"/>pline, and put them in condition for the particu<lb break="no"/>lar kind of service to be performed. A delay of <lb/>operations (besides being dictated by the measures <lb/>which were pursuing towards a pacific termin<lb break="no"/>tion of the war) has been in itself deemed prefe<lb break="no"/>rable to immature efforts. A statement, from the <lb/>proper department, with regard to the number <lb/>of troops raised, and some other points which <lb/>have been suggested, will afford more precise in<lb break="no"/>formation as a guide to the legislative consultations <lb/>and, among other things, will enable Congress to <lb/>judge whether some additional stimulus to the re<lb break="no"/>cruiting service may not be advisable.</p>
                <p>In looking forward to the future expence of <lb/>the operations, which may be found inevitable, I <lb/>derive consolation from the information I receive <lb/>that the product of the revenues for the present <lb/>year, is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community, for the service of the ensuing year. This however, will be bet<lb break="no"/>ter ascertained in the course of the session; and it <lb/>is proper to add, that the information alluded to <lb/>proceeds from the supposition of no material ex<lb break="no"/>tention of the spirit of hostilities.</p>
                <p> I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs, without again recommending to your considera<lb break="no"/>tion the expediency of more adequate provision <lb/>for giving energy to the laws throughout our in<lb break="no"/>terior frontier; and for restraining the commission <lb/>of outrages upon the Indians; without which all <lb/>
               <supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> plans must prove nugatory. To enable by <lb/>
               <supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>ent rewards the employment of qualified <lb/>
               <supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> persons to reside among them, as agents, <lb/>would also contribute to the preservation of peace <lb/>and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients, an eligible plan could be devised for <lb/>promoing civilization among the friendly tribes, <lb/>and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale <lb/>equal to their wants, and under regulation calc<lb break="no"/>tion, its influence in cementing their interest <lb/>with ours could not but be considerable.</p>
                <p> The prosperous state of our revenue had been <lb/>intimated–This would be still more the case, <lb/>were it not for the impediments which in some<cb/>places continue to embarrass the collection of<supplied reason="copy curved">???</supplied> 
               <lb/>duties on spirits, distilled within the United States.</p>
                <p>These impediments have lessened, and are<supplied reason="copy warpped">?ess???d</supplied> 
               <lb/>in local extent; and as applied to the community <lb/>at large, the contentment with the law<supplied reason="copy missing">app???</supplied> to be progressive.</p>
                <p> But symptoms of increased opposition have <lb/>lately manifested themselves in certain quarters; <lb/>I judged special interposition on my part, proper <lb/>and adviseable, and under this impression have <lb/>issued a proclamation, warning against all unlaw<lb break="no"/>ful combinations and proceedings, having for this <lb/>object, or tending to obstruct the operation of <lb/>the law in question, and announcing that all law<lb break="no"/>ful ways and means would be strictly put in ex<lb break="no"/>cution, for bring to justice the infractors there<lb break="no"/>of, and securing obedience thereto.</p>
                <p> Measures have also been taken for the prosecu<lb break="no"/>tion of offenders. And Congress may be assured, <lb/>that nothing within constitutional and legal limits <lb/>which may depend on me, shall be wanting<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>
               <lb break="no"/>sert and maintain the just authority of the law. <lb/>In fulfilling this trust, I shall count entirely upon <lb/>the full co-operation of the other departments of <lb/>the government, and upon the zealous support of <lb/>all good citizens.</p>
                <p>I cannot forbear to bring again into the view <lb/>of the legislature the subject of a revision of the <lb/>judiciary system. A representation from the jud<lb break="no"/>ges of the supreme court, which will be laid be<lb break="no"/>fore you, points out some of the inconveniences <lb/>that are being experienced. In the course of the execu<lb break="no"/>tion of the laws, considerations rise out of the <lb/>structure of that system, which some cases,<supplied reason="copy warpped">???</supplied> 
               <lb/>to relax their efficacy. As connected with the <lb/>subject provisions to facilitate the raking of<supplied reason="copy warpped">???</supplied> 
               <lb/>upon processes out of the Courts of the United <lb/>States, and supplementary definition of offence, <lb/>against the constitution and laws of the union,<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> 
               <lb/>of the punishment for such offences, will, it is pre<lb break="no"/>sumed, be found worthy of particular attention.</p>
                <p> Observations on the value of peace with other <lb/>nations are unnecessary; I would be wise, how<lb break="no"/>ever, by timely provisions, to guard against those <lb/>acts of our own citizens which might tend to dis<lb break="no"/>turb it, and to put ourselves in a condition<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> 
               <lb/>give that satisfaction to foreign nations, which<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> 
               <lb/>may sometimes have occasion to require from them.</p>
                <p> I particularly recommend to your considerations <lb/>the means of preventing those aggressions by our <lb/>citizens, on the territory of other nations, as <lb/>other infractions of the law of nations, which <lb/>furnishes just subject of complaint, might endan<lb break="no"/>ger our own peace with them. And, in general the <lb/>maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign <lb/>powers will be presented to your attention<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> 
               <lb/>expiration of the law for that purpose which taken <lb/>place, if not re<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>, at the close of the present <lb/>session.</p>
                <p> In execution of the authority given by the leg<lb break="no"/>islature, measures have been taken for engage<lb break="no"/>ment of our mint–others have been employed at <lb/>at home. Provision has been made of the requisite <lb/>buildings, and therefore now putting into proper <lb/>condition for the purpose of the establishment. <lb/>There has also been a small beginning in the coin<lb break="no"/>age of half-dollars; the want of small coins in cir<lb break="no"/>culation call<supplied reason="copy blur">ing</supplied> the first attention to them.</p>
                <p> The regulation of some provision in the <lb/>law, which establishes the Post Office, open to <lb/>in experiment, against the transmission of news<lb break="no"/>papers to distant parts of the country.–Should <lb/>that, upon the enquiry, be found to be the fact, <lb/>a full conviction of the importance of facilitating <lb/>the circulation of political intelligence and infor <lb/>mation, will, I doubt not, lead to the application <lb/>of a remedy.</p>
                <p> The adoption of a constitution for the state of <lb/>Kentucky, has been notified to me. The legis<lb break="no"/>lature will share with me in the satisfaction which <lb/>arises from an event interesting to the happiness <lb/>of the part of the nation to which it relates, and <lb/>conducive to the general order.</p>
                <p>It is proper likewise to inform you, that since <lb/>my last communication on the subject, and in <lb/>further execution of the acts, severally making <lb/>provision for the public debt, and for the reduc<lb break="no"/>tion thereof, three new loans have been effected, <lb/>each for three millions of florins,—one at Ant<lb break="no"/>werp, at the annual interest of four and one-half <lb/>per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in <lb/>lieu of all charages.–The rates of these loans, and <lb/>the circumstance under which they have been made, ar confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad.</p>
                <p> Among the objects to which these funds have <lb/>been directed to be applied, the payment of the <lb/>debts due to certain foreign officers, according to <lb/>the provision made during the last session, has <lb/>been embraced.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen of the House of Representatives</hi>, </hi>
               <lb/>I entertain a strong hope, that the state of the <lb/>national finances is now sufficiently matured to <lb/>enable you to enter upon a systematic and effect<lb break="no"/>tual arrangement for the regular redemption and <lb/>discharge of the public debt, according to the <lb/>right which has been reserved to the government <lb/>–no measure can be more desirable, whether view<lb break="no"/>ed with an eye to its intrinsic importance, or to <lb/>the general sentiment and wish of the nation.</p>
                <p> Provision is likewise requisite for the reimburse<lb break="no"/>ment of the loan which has been made for the <lb/>Bank of the United States, pursuant to the sec<lb break="no"/>tion of the act by which it is incorporated. In <lb/>fulfilling the public stipulations, in this particular, <lb/>it is expected a valuable saving will be made.</p>
                <p> Appropriations for the current service of the en<lb break="no"/>suing year, and for such extraordinaries as may <lb/>require provision, will demand, and I doubt not, engage your early attention.</p>

                <p> Various temporary laws will expire during the <lb/>present sesssion. Among these, that which regu<lb break="no"/>lates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, <lb/>will merit your particular notice.</p>
                <p> The results of your common deliberations hi<lb break="no"/>therto, will, I trust, be productive of solide and <lb/>durable advantages to our constituentes; such as <lb/>by conciliating more and more their ultimate suf<lb break="no"/>frage, will tend to strength and confirm their <lb/>attachment, upon which, under Divine Providence, <lb/>materially depend their union, their safety, and <lb/>their happiness.</p>
                <p>Still further to promote and secure these inesti<lb break="no"/>mable ends, there is nothing which can have a <lb/>more powerful tendency, than the careful culti<lb break="no"/>vatino of harmony, combined with a due regard <lb/>to stability in the public councils.</p>

Unused to such un<lb break="no"/>ruly gusts, the citizens, particularly the fair, were <lb/>thrown into a momentary d<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>ation.

Report says, that a Mr. <lb/>Wade, his wife and two of their children, his bro<lb break="no"/>ther, and a young man, were all, except the last <lb/>mentioned, drowned from one boat near Yellow <lb/>Hook, a few miles from the city.

Mr Kizer, and <lb/>three others who were in the mill, were blown to pieces; and a Mr. Henry Fraily, a copartner <lb/>of Mr. Kizer, was so wounded that his life is dis<lb break="no"/>pared of.

On Saturday last, at Dilly's station <lb/>opposite the mouth of Grave creek, the Indians <lb/>came into one of the houses and killed four and <lb/>wounded one; the number of Indians was suppos <lb/>ed to be twenty. It is thought they will strike <lb/>this quarter. To-morrow morning I intend to <lb/>start with a party to try and fall in with them."</p>

                <p>SUNDAY last arrived an express in this town from the <lb/>commissioners who were sent to treat with the Indians: <lb/>he had left the commissioners on this side of Lake Erie, that <lb/>day eight days. They had been met at Niagara by Indian <lb/>commissioners, and with them had sailed in separate vessels <lb/>to the mouth of Detroit river 18 miles from Detroit, where <lb/>our commissioners were directed to remain, until an as<lb break="no"/>swer should be brought from the great council of In<lb break="no"/>dian nations assembled at the rapids of the Miami and the <lb/>Lake. On the 2d of August an answer was brought to <lb/>this effect that the only terms onw hich peace could be <lb/>made was our ceding the country on the west of the Ohio <lb/>and Allegheny rivers. The commissioners suggested the <lb/>impossibilities of doing this, as the lands had been sold by the Congress, and people had settled on them, but that the <lb/>United States would be willing to give more goods than <lb/>they had given at any other time. The Indians replied <lb/>that if the Congress would give one half these goods to the people that had settled, the would leave the land, and <lb/>remove the difficulty. Our commissioners replied that the <lb/>land they must have, and would not give it up. The In<lb break="no"/>dians said it was well, and there need no more be said. <lb/>However desired them to remain if they thought proper <lb/>until they returned to the council, and laid this before them. <lb/>On the 16th of August two Indians came and informed that the final result of their deliberations was the country <lb/>in question or war. The express is of opinion from the <lb/>language of individual Indians in private, and from other <lb/>circumstances, that the British wholly conduct their council, <lb/>and dictate their demands.</p>
                <p> By the arrival of some person from Fort Washington on <lb/>Monday last, we are informed, that the Indians still conti<lb break="no"/>ue hovering about our garrisons, and occasionally stealing <lb/>horses, that the army is in high spirits, anxiously waiting <lb/>the event of the treaty, and hoping that a campaign will <lb/>take place, as no idea of peace is entertained by any one; <lb/>that the greatest pains has been taken by the commander <lb/>in chief, in training his men in the act wood fighting, <lb/>and that from their proficiency, and the<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>imity pre<lb break="no"/>vailing throughout the whole army, success may be expec<lb break="no"/>ted should a campaign take place.</p>

                <p> A Mr. Spier was removed from his lodgings in this city <lb/>on Sunday last to Governors Island, where he died this <lb/>morning.

                <p> According to a list published of the births and deaths in <lb/>the several religious societies of Philadelphia it appears that <lb/>from August 1, 1792 to August 1, 1793, the Births a<lb break="no"/>mounted to 2511, and the Death to 1467."</p>

                <p>"You request I would endeavour to give you a parti <lb/>cular account of the state of the city in general and the <lb/>rise and progress of the malignant fever now raging here.</p>
                <p>"I believe it will be difficult precisely to determine its <lb/>origin; but it is generally admitted to have been imported <lb/>from Cape-Francois, in a vessel which came to a wharf be<lb break="no"/>twen Arch and Race-street, beause the infection broke <lb/>out ina house connected with that vessel, and it was after<lb break="no"/>wards traced to that vessel. The disorder overtook several <lb/>families thereabouts. But most people apprehended it to <lb/>be the general fall-fever, which acted severly on those who <lb/>had the influenza–To that there was no material danger <lb/>apprehended until the death of Peter Ashton, in Vine-street, <lb/>who after a short illness, died about one month past; af<lb break="no"/>ter which the disorder was clearly discovered to be the putrid <lb/>or yellow fever, and each person became after of his neighbours, insomuch that if any became sick they were a<lb break="no"/>voided, and many fled from the sick, leaving them in a<lb break="no"/>destitute situation, perhaps shut up in a house, and the <lb/>neighbours alarmed, merchants and housekeepers moved in<lb break="no"/>to the country, and fear was stamped on every counte<lb break="no"/>nance–infirmness possessed the hearts of the people–little business was done except packing up–engaging waggons to <lb/>move goods into the country, and searching for shelter for <lb/>their families; many families set off without having a par<lb break="no"/>ticular place to go to. Thus the country became alarm<lb break="no"/>ed. Individuals died in the country–but I cannot learn <lb/>
               <supplied reason="copy missing">?</supplied>hat it spread there.</p>
                <p>"The overseers duty became exceedingly heavy, and <lb/>several of them were taken sick; others abandoned their <lb/>post, and the business bore very hard on the remaining few. <lb/>Finding deaths increasingly abundantly, they procured car<lb break="no"/>penters to make coarse coffins by the do<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>. The malady <lb/>still increasing in Water, Front, Race and Vine-street, <lb/>threatened desolation in those quarters. The overseers, <lb/>moved by the distresses of the helpless, took possession of <lb/>Bush-Hill mansion (it being empty) and erected a hospital, <lb/>employed some physicians and nurses; sent out some ac<lb break="no"/>comadations, and provided for interring the dead.</p>
                <p>"The overseers became inadequate to the business by <lb/>reason fo fear; few in number, and the funds exhausted; <lb/>added to this the extravagant wages of the nurses, two <lb/>and three dollars per day, most of the magistrates fled; <lb/>the house of employment and hospital shut their doors a<lb break="no"/>gainst all indigent and indisposed persons. Thus were the <lb/>people, who had been private patientes on the poor list, a<lb break="no"/>bandoned and had no sheltering place, and those who were <lb/>slightly indisposed, were sent to Bush-Hill and became vic<lb break="no"/>tims with many others.</p>
                <p>"The inhabitants were requested to meet by public <lb/>advertisement, and a committee of 40 was appointed to <lb/>take charge of the Bush-Hill hospital, and to relieve the <lb/>distressed in the city and its vicinity they became organized, Ianto693 negociated a loan in the bank, two of the number volunta<lb break="no"/>rily offered their service to see the business of Bush-Hill <lb/>properly conducted; bedsteads were procured, the house <lb/>cleaned, matrons appointed and nurses under their direc<lb break="no"/>tion; an apothecary, with medicine, &amp;c. and four physi<lb break="no"/>cians to attend once a day.</p>
                <p> The remainder of the committee attend at the State <lb/>House, receive information from the committee at Bush - <lb/>Hill, and supply their demands; receive all sheets, shirts, <lb/>&amp;c. &amp;c. at the State-House, also keep a supply of <lb/>ready made coffins to furnish as occasion required. Se<lb break="no"/>veral carts are procured for the various purposes of carry<lb break="no"/>ing out the sick whom the doctors pronounce to have the <lb/>fever, of disposing the corps,and for carrying provisions <cb/>and other necessaries to and from the hospital. THere is <lb/>also a house fitted up, and under the care of a matron, to <lb/>be for the use of those children whose parents have died <lb/>with the fever; as all their relations and neighbours are <lb/>shy of them; the governor has directed the State Treasury <lb/>to be open for their use, and they to be accountable to him <lb/>for their expenditures.–The city seems quite solitary, and <lb/>business at a stand; deaths numerous, and no parade at <lb/>the interment of any; the bells do not ring, nor is there <lb/>any invitations to the funeral of any. I think about 1000 <lb/>have died since the disorder first made its appearance, but <lb/>it cannot be ascertained with precision; and we think be<lb break="no"/>tween 15 and 20,000 removed from their habitations.</p>
                <p>"The doctors suppose the disorder a little checked by <lb/>the cool weather; how that is I know now."</p>
                <p> By a passenger, arrived from Albany this morning, we <lb/>learn that, in order to prevent the introduction of the Yel<lb break="no"/>low Fever in Albany, they have formed Committees, and <lb/>fixed a Gun-Boat at some distance from the city, where all <lb/>vessels are stopt till the Doctors examine the passengers– <lb/>And, that Colonel Hamilton and Lady were arrived, but <lb/>were denied admittance into the city, and had taken lod<lb break="no"/>gings at a Mr. M'Gown's, at Green-Bush.</p>

               <hi rend="center">Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadelphia, to  <lb/>the Printers of this PAper, dated September 28.</hi>
            </p>
                <p>"The papers must have amply informed you of the me<lb break="no"/>lancholy situation of this city, for five or six weeks past. <lb/>Grave digging has been the only business carrying on; and <lb/>ndeed I may say of late Pit digging, where people are <lb/>interred indiscriminately in three tiers of coffins. From the <lb/>most accurate observations I can make upon matters, I <lb/>think I speak within bounds, when I Say eighteen hundred <lb/>persons have perished (I do not say all of the yellow fever) <lb/>since its first appearance on the 3d of August, in North <lb/>Water-street; others think a larger number–but I confess <lb/>we are a good deal in the dark on the subject at present, <lb/>and it will take some time to have accurate returns made.</p>
                <p>"People have been hitherto so panic struck, that little <lb/>has been attnded to but the means of self-preservation; <lb/>gloom and melancholy is on every persons countenance; <lb/>nothing but the yellow fever is talked of; the street are <lb/>often seen without a passenger; the wharfs are deserted, <lb/>the markets miserable and uncommonly high, and nearly <lb/>one half the citizens departed. The city is truly republi<lb break="no"/>can; pomp and distinction have in a great measure disad<lb break="no"/>peared, and bad Plato himself come among us to preach <lb/>up the practice of true republicansim, his lectures could <lb/>not have had a greater effect upon the minds of men than <lb/>the present mortality.</p>
                <p>"We make use of no other precaution for avoiding the <lb/>contagion, than not going into infected houses–keeping <lb/>our own well aired, clean, and frequently having the walls, <lb/>white-washed. considering the general terro, I have <lb/>more than once felt my pulse, to discover whether I was <lb/>really alive or not; however I now begin to hoep we may <lb/>escape, as cool weather is fast approaching, and one-street <lb/>in general healthy.</p>
                <p>"Of all things, this yellow fever is the most insidious– <lb/>its approaches are generally gradual–a person imagines <lb/>himself well when he is dying–other loss the use of rea<lb break="no"/>son entirely, and die in that situations. with those few <lb/>that recover its effects are long left. It acts like a steel<lb break="no"/>trap–when once it gets hold of a person, it does not ea<lb break="no"/>sily let him get off.</p>

                <p> Monday evening last, a number of persons assembled in <lb/>the fields, when they commenced the demolition of Mo<lb break="no"/>ther Cay's house, which in a short time was intirely re<lb break="no"/>sed to the ground floor; the furniture, beds, clothing, &amp;c. were all destroyed. another house of ill fame tenanted by <lb/>Mother Giles, under went a similar fate. It is aid that three persons <lb/>were wounded, one dangerously, from the firing of small <lb/>arms, by some persons who were placed in the house for <lb/>its defence.–We lament that our worthy Mayor, received <lb/>some injury, in endeavouring to disperse the people.</p>

               <pb n="3"/> The following new cities, independent of innu<lb break="no"/>merable small towns, have been lately begun to be <lb/>built in America. The city of Washington, which, in the year 1800, is to be the capital of <lb/>the United States; the city of Paterson, in the State of New Jersey; the city of Hudson, upon <lb/>the North River, in the state of New York; the <lb/>city of Columbia, which is now the capital of the State of South Carolina; the city of Martenberg, <lb/>now the capital of North Carolina; the city of <lb/>Knoxcille, in teh new district of Franklyn; the <lb/>city of Nuskville, in the new district of Cumber<lb break="no"/>land; the city of Lexington, and the city of <lb/>Donxville, in the new State of Kentucky; and <lb/>the city of Bennington, in the new state of Ver<lb break="no"/>mont. The ground is also marked out, and the <lb/>lots are upon sale, for building one more new city, <lb/>to be called Newport, on the river Potowmac, <lb/>and another called Athens, on the banks of the <lb/>Mississippi.</p>

            </p>
                <p> THE Secretary of the Senate announced, that <lb/>the Members of the Senate were ready to ad<lb break="no"/>mit the Members of the House of Representatives <lb/>in the Senate Chamber, in order to receive the Pre<lb break="no"/>sident's communication.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="center">FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND OF  <lb/>THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</hi>
            </p>
                <p> Since the commencement of the term for which I have <lb/>been again called into office, no fit occasion has arisen for <lb/>expressing to me fellow citizens at large, the deep and <lb/>respectful sense which I feel of the renewed testimony <lb/>of public approbation. While on the one hand it awaken<lb break="no"/>ed my gratitude for all those instances of affectionate par<lb break="no"/>tiality with which I have been honoured by my country; <lb/>on the other, it could not prevent an earnest wish for that <lb/>retirement, from which no private consideration should <lb/>ever have torn me. But influenced by the belief, that <lb/>my conduct would be estimated according to its real mo<lb break="no"/>tives; and that the people, and the authorities derived <lb/>from them, would support exertions having nothing per<lb break="no"/>sonal for their object, I have obeyed the suffrage which <lb/>commanded me to resume the executive power; and I <lb/>humbly implore that Being, on whose will the fate of <lb/>nations depends, to crown with success our mutual endea<lb break="no"/>vors for the general happiness.</p>
                <p> As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers <lb/>with whom the United States have the most extensive re<lb break="no"/>lations there was reason to apprehend that our intercourse <lb/>with them might be interrupted, and our disposition for <lb/>peace drawn into question, by the suspicions too often <lb/>entertained by belligerent nations. It seemed therefore <lb/>to be my duty to admonish our citizens of the consequen<lb break="no"/>ces of a contraband trade, and of hostile acts to any of <lb/>the parties; and to obtain by a declaration of the exist<lb break="no"/>ing legal state of things, an easier admission of our right <lb/>to the immunities belonging to our situation. Under <lb/>these impressions, the proclamation, which will be laid before you, was issued.</p>
                <p>In this posture of affairs, both new and delicate, I res<lb break="no"/>olved to adopt general rules which should conform to <lb/>the treaties and assert the privileges of the United <lb/>States. These were reduced into a system which will be <lb/>communicated to you. Although I have not thought <lb/>myself at liberty to forbid the sale of the prizes, permit<lb break="no"/>ted by our treaty of commerce with France, to be brought <lb/>into our ports; I have not refused to cause them to be <lb/>restored, when they were taken within the protection of <lb/>our territory, or by vessels commissioned, or equipped in <lb/>a warlike form within the limits of the United States.</p>
                <p>It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct, im<lb break="no"/>prove, or enforce this plan of procedure; and it will pro<lb break="no"/>bably be found expedient to extend the legal code, and <lb/>the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States to ma<lb break="no"/>ny cases which, though dependent on principles already <lb/>recognized, demand some further provisions.</p>
                <p> Where individuals shall, within the United States, ar<lb break="no"/>ray themselves in hostility against any of the powers at war, <lb/>or enter upon military expeditions or enterprizes within <lb/>the jurisdiction of the United States; or where the pe<lb break="no"/>nalties on violations of the law of nations may have been <lb/>indistinctly marked, or are inadequate; those offenses <lb/>cannot receive too early and close an attention, and require prompt and decisive remedies.</p>
            <cb/>
                <p>Whatsoever those remedies may be, they will be well <lb/>administered by the judiciary, who possess a long-esta<lb break="no"/>blished course of investigation, effectual process, and offi<lb break="no"/>cers in the habit of executing it.</p>
                <p>In like manner, as several of the courts have doubted, <lb/>under particular circumstances, their power to liberate the <lb/>vessels of a nation at peace, and even of a citizen of the <lb/>United States, although seized under a false colour of be<lb break="no"/>ing hostile property; and have denied their power to liber<lb break="no"/>ate certain captures within the protection of our territo<lb break="no"/>ry; it would seem proper to regulate their jurisdiction in <lb/>these points. But if the executive is to be the resort in <lb/>either of the two last mentioned cases it is hoped that he will <lb/>be authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courts, when, for his own information, he shall request it.</p>
                <p>I can not recommend to your notice measures for the <lb/>fulfillment of our duties to the rest of the world, without a<lb break="no"/>gain pressing upon you the necessity of placing ourselves <lb/>in a condition of complete defense, and of exacting from <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">them</hi>  the fulfillment of <hi rend="italic">their</hi>  duties toward <hi rend="italic">us</hi>. The U<lb break="no"/>nited States ought not to indulge a persuasion, that, con<lb break="no"/>trary to the order of human events, they will for ever <lb/>keep at a distance those painful appeals to arms, with <lb/>which the history of every other nation abounds. There <lb/>is a rank due to the United States among nations, which <lb/>will be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult, we must be <lb/>able to repel it; If we desire to secure peace, one of the <lb/>most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it <lb/>must be known that we are at all times ready for war. <lb/>The documents which will be presented to you will shew <lb/>the amount, and kinds of arms and military stores now <lb/>in our magazines and arsenals; and yet an addition even <lb/>to these supplies cannot with prudence be neglected, as it <lb/>would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuring a <lb/>warlike apparatus in the moment of public danger.</p>
                <p>Nor can such arrangements, with such objects, be ex<lb break="no"/>posed to the censure or jealousy of the warmest friends of <lb/>Republican Government. They are incapable of abuse <lb/>in the hands of the militia, who ought to possess a pride <lb/>in being the depository of the force of the Republic, and <lb/>may be trained to a degree of energy equal to every mi<lb break="no"/>litary exigency of the United States. But it is an en<lb break="no"/>quiry which cannot be too solemnly pursued, whether <lb/>the act, "more effectually to provide for the national <lb/>defense by establishing an uniform militia throughout <lb/>the United States," has organized them so as to produce <lb/>their full effect; whether your own experience in the se<lb break="no"/>veral States has not detected some imperfections in the <lb/>scheme; and whether a material feature in an improve<lb break="no"/>ment of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity for <lb/>the study of those branches of the military art which can <lb/>scarcely ever be attained by practice alone.</p>
                <p>The connection of the United States with Europe has <lb/>become extremely interesting. The occurrences which <lb/>relate to it ,and have passed under the knowledge of the <lb/>Executive, will be exhibited to Congress in a subsequent <lb/>communication.</p>
                <p>When we contemplate the war on our frontiers, it <lb/>may be truly affirmed that every reasonable effort has <lb/>been made to adjust the causes of dissension with the In<lb break="no"/>dians north of the Ohio. The instructions given to the <lb/>Commissioners evince a moderation and equity; proceed<lb break="no"/>ing from a sincere love of peace, and a liberality, having <lb/>no restriction but the essential interests and dignity of the <lb/>United States. The attempt, however, of an amicable <lb/>negotiation having been frustrated, the troops have <lb/>marched to act offensively. Although the proposed <lb/>treaty did not arrest the progress of military preparation, <lb/>it is doubtful how far the advance of the season, before <lb/>good faith justified active movements, may retard them, <lb/>during the remainder of the year. From the papers <lb/>and intelligence, which relate to this important subject, <cb/> you will determine whether the deficiency in the number <lb/>of troops granted by law shall be compensated by suc<lb break="no"/>cors of militia, or additional encouragements shall be proposed to recruits.</p>
                <p>An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Execu<lb break="no"/>tive for peace with the Creeks and the Cherokees. The for<lb break="no"/>mer have been relieved with corn and with clothing, and <lb/>offensive measures against them prohibited <lb/>during the recess of Congress. To satisfy the complaints of the <lb/>latter, prosecutions have been instituted for the violences <lb/>committed upon them. But the papers which will be <lb/>delivered to you, disclose the critical footing on which <lb/>we stand in regard to both those tribes; and it is with Congress to pronounce what shall be done.</p>
                <p> After they shall have provided for the present emer<lb break="no"/>gency, it will merit their most serious labours to render <lb/>tranquillity with the savages permanent, by creating ties <lb/>of interest. Next to a rigorous execution of justice <lb/>on the violators of peace, the establishment of commerce <lb/>with the Indian nations in behalf of the United States, <lb/>is most likely to conciliate their attachment. But it <lb/>ought to be conducted without fraud, without extortion; with constant and plentiful supplies; with a ready mar<lb break="no"/>ket for the commodities of the Indians, and a stated price <lb/>for what they give in payment and receive in exchange. <lb/>Individuals will not pursue such a traffic, unless they be <lb/>allured by the hope of profit; but it will be enough for <lb/>the United States to be reimbursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the opinion of Congress, <lb/>they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by any <lb/>means yet in the hands of the Executive.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="center">GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF  <lb/>REPRESENTATIVES,</hi>
            </p>
                <p> The commissioners charged with the settlement of the <lb/>accounts between the United and Individual States con<lb break="no"/>cluded their important function within the limited time <lb/>by law; and the balances struck in their report, which <lb/>will be laid before congress, have been placed on the books <lb/>of the Treasury.</p>
                <p>On the 1st day of June last, an installment of on mil<lb break="no"/>lion of florins became payable on the loans of the United <lb/>States in Holland. This was adjusted by a prolongation <lb/>of the period of reimbursement, in nature of a new loan, <lb/>at an interest of five per cent. for the term of ten years; <lb/>and the expenses of this operation were a commission of <lb/>three per cent.</p>
                <p>The first installment of the loan of two millions of <lb/>dollars from the Bank of the United States, has been paid, <lb/>as was directed by law. For the second it is necessary <lb/>that provision be made.</p>
                <p>No pecuniary consideration is more urgent, than the <lb/>redemption and discharge of the public debt: On none <lb/>can delay be more injurious, or an economy of time <lb/>more valuable.</p>
                <p>The productiveness of the public revenues hitherto, <lb/>has continued to equal the anticipations which were form<lb break="no"/>ed of it; but it is not expected to prove <lb/>commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested. Some <lb/>auxiliary provisions will therefore, it is presumed, be re<lb break="no"/>quisite: and it is hoped that these may be made consis<lb break="no"/>tently with a due regard to the convenience of ourcitizens <lb/>who can not but be sensible of the true wisdom of encoun<lb break="no"/>tering a small present addition to their contributions to <lb/>obviate a future accumulation of burdens.</p>
                <p>But here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of <lb/>the tax on the transportation of public prints. There <lb/>is no resource so firm for the government of the United States as the affections of the People guided by an enligh<lb break="no"/>tened policy; and to this primary good, nothing can <lb/>conduce more than a faithful representation of public <lb/>proceedings, diffused, without restraint, throughout the United States.

                <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE <lb/>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                <p> The several subjects, to which I have now referred, o<lb break="no"/>pen a wide range to your deliberations and involve <lb/>some of the choicest interests of our common country. Permit <lb/>me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude of your <lb/>task:–Without an unprejudiced coolness, the welfare of <lb/>the government may be hazarded; without harmony, as <lb/>far as consists with freedom of sentiment, its dignity may <lb/>be lost.–But as the legislative proceedings of the United <lb/>States will never, I trust, be reproached for the want of <lb/>temper or of candour, so shall not the public happiness lan<lb break="no"/>guish from the want of my strenuous and warmest cooperation.</p>

                <p>The President having withdrawn, the Members <lb/>of the House of Representatives returned to their <lb/>Chamber, where the President's Address was read, <lb/>and referred to a Committee to report the draft of an answer.</p>
                <p>A Committee was then appointed to report the unfinished business of the last House.–Adjourned.</p>

            </p>
                <p>The Journal of the Commissioners for treating <lb/>with the Indians was read. It is minute and leng<lb break="no"/>thy. The definitive answer of the Indians contains <lb/>their reasons for rejecting the proposals of the <lb/>Commissioners, drawn up in a masterly manner, it <lb/>bears all the appearance of EUropean logic, faintly <lb/>clad in an Indian dress. All the documents relative <lb/>to this business were referred to a Committee of <lb/>the whole on the state of the Union.</p>
                <p>A message was received from the President, com<lb break="no"/>munication sundry papers relative to our European <lb/>relations, and also the result of the proceedings of <lb/>the Commissioners appointed to settle the accounts <lb/>of the United States with the Individual States.</p>
                <p>The first set of papers is introduced by a message, <lb/>of which the following is a copy:</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="center">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">United States</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Dec</hi>. 5, 1793  <lb/>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE  <lb/>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</hi>
            </p>
                <p>As the present situations of the several nations of <lb/>Europe, and especially of those with whom the United <lb/>States have important relations, cannot but render the <lb/>state of things between them and us; matter of interest <lb/>ing enquiry to the Legislature, and may indeed give rise <lb/>to deliberations to which they alone are competent, I <lb/>have thought it my duty to communicate them certain <lb/>correspondencies which have taken place.</p>
                <p>The Representatives and Executive Bodies of France <lb/>have manifested generally a friendly attachment to this <lb/>country; have given advantages to our commerce and <lb/>navigation, and have made overtures for placing these <lb/>advantages on permanent ground; a decree however of <lb/>the National Assembly, subjecting vessels laden with pro<lb break="no"/>visions to be carried into their ports and making enemy <lb/>goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend, contrary to <lb/>our treaty, though revoked at one time, as to the United <lb/>States, has been since extended to their vessels also, as has <lb/>been recently stated to us. Representations on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject will be immediately given in charge to our Minister <lb/>there, and the result shall be communicated to the Legi<lb break="no"/>slature.</p>
                <p>It is with extreme concern I have to inform you, that <lb/>the proceedings of the person whom they have unfortunately appointed their Minister Plenipotentiary here have <lb/>breathed nothing of the friendly spirit of that nation <lb/>which sent him; their tendency on the contrary has been <lb/>to involve us in a war abroad; and discord and anarchy <lb/>at home. So far as his acts or those of his agents, have <lb/>threatened our immediate commitment in the war, or <lb/>flagrant insult to the authority of the laws, their effect <lb/>has been counteracted by the ordinary cognizance of the <lb/>laws, and by an exertions of the powers confided to me. <lb/>Where their danger was not imminent, they have been <lb/>born with, from sentiments of regard to his nation, from <lb/>a sense of their friendship towards us, from a conviction <lb/>that they would not suffer us to remain long exposed to <cb/> the action of a person who has so little respectedour mu <lb/>tual dispositions, and, I will add, from a reliance on the <lb/>firmness of my fellow citizens in their principles of peace <lb/>and order. In the mean time, I have respected and pur<lb break="no"/>sued the stipulations of our treaties, according to what I <lb/>judge the true sense; and have withheld no act of <lb/>friendship which their affairs have called for from us, and <lb/>which justice to others let us free to perform. I have gone <lb/>further;–rather than employ force for the restitution of <lb/>certain vessels which I deemed the United States bound to <lb/>restore, I thought it more advisable to satisfy the parties, <lb/>by avowing it to be my opinion, that if restitution were <lb/>not made, it would be incumbent on the United States <lb/>to make compensation. The papers now communicated <lb/>will more particularly apprize you of these transactions.</p>
                <p>The vexations and spolitation understood to have been <lb/>committed on our vessels and commerce by the cruizers <lb/>and officers of some of the belligerent powers, appeared to <lb/>require attention. The proofs of these however not hav<lb break="no"/>ing been brought forward, the description of citizens sup<lb break="no"/>posed to have suffered were notified, that on furnishing <lb/>them to the Executive Power, due measures would be <lb/>taken to obtain redress of the past, and more effectual provisions against the future. Should such documents <lb/>be furnished ,proper representations will be made thereon, <lb/>with a just resistance on a redress proportioned to eh ex<lb break="no"/>igency of the case.</p>
                <p>The BRitish Government having undertaken by orders <lb/>to the commanders of their armed vessels to restrain ge<lb break="no"/>nerally our commerce in corn and other provisions to their <lb/>own ports and those of their friends, the instructions now <lb/>communicated were immediately forwarded to our Mi<lb break="no"/>nister at that court. In the mean time, some discussions<lb break="no"/>on the subject took place between him and them; these <lb/>are also laid before you; and I may expect to learn the <lb/>result of his special instructions in time to make it known <lb/>to the legislature during their present sessions.</p>
                <p>Very early after the arrival of a British Minister here, <lb/>mutual explanation on the execution of the Treaty of <lb/>Peace were entered into with that Minister; these are <lb/>now laid before you for your information.</p>
                <p>On the subjects of mutual interest between this coun<lb break="no"/>try and Spain, negociations and conferences are now de<lb break="no"/>pending. The public requiring that the present state of those should be made known to the legislature in con<lb break="no"/>fidence only, they shall be the subject of a separate and <lb/>subsequent communication.</p>

                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">If</hi>, the letter with which you honoured me on the 22d <lb/>ult. had not entered into a train of recrimination a<lb break="no"/>gainst the United States, I should not now trouble you <lb/>with a return to its unpleasant topics. Among the rea<lb break="no"/>sons, which would have induced me to add nothing to <lb/>my letter the 1st of lat month, its would have been <lb/>of some weight that by silence I should avoid the repeti<lb break="no"/>tion of a style and manner, which seem to have produced <lb/>a personal excitement.</p>
                <p> As you are willing to admit the authenticity of Lord <lb/>Dorcester's speech, we will, with your approbation, re<lb break="no"/>serve for a future discussion, on what occasion, and to <lb/>what degree, an explanation may be required by the go<lb break="no"/>vernment of the United States from a foreign minister.</p>
                <p>I selected only one passage of that speech, because in <lb/>it was concentrated the real object of the whole; which <lb/>was to declare an expectation, that Great Britain would <lb/>be at War with the united States in the course of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent year. and, if she were, to cause the warriors to draw <lb/>a line. this is the undisguised sense of the governor-ge<lb break="no"/>neral, unaffected by the preliminary words, which you <lb/>have thought proper to quote. It is your own interpre<lb break="no"/>tation. For so far are you from contradicting my asser<lb break="no"/>tion, that Lord Dorchester fostered and encouraged in <lb/>the Indians, hostile dispositions towards us, that you con<lb break="no"/>tinue the greater part of your remaining observations to <lb/>vindicate his persuasion and your own, that the principal <lb/>aggression, leading to hostility, proceeded from the United <lb/>States and to suggest many others of the same tendency, <lb/>upon which you would not dilate.</p>
                <p> I shall not shrink, Sir, from your charges.</p>
                <p>1st Notwithstanding the territory, upon which certain <lb/>inhabitants of Vermont are presented in your letter of the 5th of July, 1792, to have trespassed, belong to the <lb/>United States; yet on the 9th of the same month did <lb/>my predecessor give you, as is admitted, positive assur<lb break="no"/>ances of the determination to discourage and repress the <lb/>subject of your complaint. The necessary instructions <lb/>were accordingly forwarded to that state. On examining <lb/>your correspondence with my department, it does not ap<lb break="no"/>pear that from the 9th of July, 1792, to the 10th of <lb/>March, 1794 upwards of nineteen months, our govern<lb break="no"/>ment ever unrdestood from yourself, or any authority of<lb break="no"/>his Britannic Majesty, that the original dissatisfaction con<lb break="no"/>tinued. Nor was any discontent heard from that quar<lb break="no"/>ter through other channels, except what related to out<lb break="no"/>rages upon our own citizens by British subjects. Then, <lb/>indeed, thirty days after the hostile tribes of Indians had <lb/>been assembled by Lord Dorchester, at Quebec, you renew<lb break="no"/>your remonstrance. Although it cannot be by any means <lb/>believed, that this was written, in order to ausher in the intelligence, which soon after arrived on his speech; ye tit <lb/>is difficult to account for so long an interval under the <lb/>circumstances supposed. Nor ought my answer, although <lb/>delayed for fifty days, until the 19th of April, 1794, to be constured into an assent to any charge, since at the end <lb/>of that period, having been disappointed, as my letter shews, in one opportunity of information, and no other <lb/>presenting itself, we were not in a capacity of contradict<lb break="no"/>ing your assertions. However, Sir, the instructions, issued <lb/>in consequence of your application, conveyed positive or<lb break="no"/>ders for the correction of what, upon examination, should <lb/>be found irregular.</p>
                <p>2d, Among the points, to which you intimate that you <lb/>might have adverted, is enumerated the fitting out of two <lb/>privateers at Charleston, South Carolina. Whatever this <lb/>transaction might have been, it probably occurred at the <lb/>commencement of the war, and before the existence of <lb/>the war was communicated to our government, by any of <lb/>the powers engaged. Had such a transaction been known <lb/>to the President in time, you can well judge from his <lb/>actual conduct, what he would then have done. His pro<cb break="no"/>clamation on the 2nd of April, 1793, his call upon the <lb/>state governors on the 26th of the same months, to co-ope<lb break="no"/>rate with him in the work of impartiality and peace; the <lb/>system of rules which he established, and which were im<lb break="no"/>parted to you, are unerring indications of the spirit of <lb/>those measures, on which he had determined. He sup<lb break="no"/>pressed the consular courts, which attempted to pass sen<lb break="no"/>tences of condemnation on captures; he restored several <lb/>vessels to British owners; prosecutions have been institut<lb break="no"/>ed against the violaters of neutrality. In a word, Sir, <lb/>what has been required, under the sanction of the law of <lb/>nations, which had not been fulfilled? How many things<lb break="no"/>have been spontaneously done, to evince our impartiality? Let me request you to review my predecessor’s letters to you of April 22, May 15, June 5, August 7, 8, 25, Sep<lb break="no"/>tember 5 and 12, 1793: and to say if more could be well <lb/>expected from us? After such demonstrations, it might <lb/>have been hoped, that the equipment of these two priva<lb break="no"/>teers would not rise again in the shape of a charge. But <lb/>the letter of the 5th of June being conceived of itself to be <lb/>satisfactory, is here inserted.</p>
                <p>"In the letter which I had the honour of writing you <lb/>on the 15th of May, in answer to your several memorials <lb/>of the 8th of that month, I mentioned that the President, <lb/>reserved for further consideration, a part of the one which <lb/>related to the equioment of two privateers in the port of <lb/>Charleston. The part alluded to was that wherein you <lb/>express your confidence that the executive government of <lb/>the United States would pursue measures for represeeing <lb/>such practices in the future, and for restoring to their rightful <lb/>owners any captures which such privateers might be bring <lb/>into the ports of the United States."</p>
                <p>"The President,after a full investigation of this subject, <lb/>and the most mature consideration, has charged me to <lb/>communicate to you, that the first part of this application <lb/>is found to be jest, and that effectual measures are taken <lb/>for preventing repetitions of the act therin complained of; but that the latter part, desiring restitution of the prizes, <lb/>is understood to be inconsistent with the rules which go<lb break="no"/>vern such cafes, and would therefore be unjustifiable to<lb break="no"/>wards the other party</p>
                <p>"The principal agents in this transaction were French <lb/>citizens. Being within the United States, at the moment <lb/>a war broke out between their own and another country, <lb/>they determine to go in its defence; they purchase, arm, <lb/>and equip a vessel, with their own money, man it them<lb break="no"/>selves, receive a regular commission from their nation, de<lb break="no"/>part out of the United states, and then commence hosti<lb break="no"/>lities by capturing a vessel If, under these circumstance,<lb break="no"/>the commission of the captors was valid, the property, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the laws of war, was, by the capture, transfer<lb break="no"/>red to them; and it would be an aggression on their na<lb break="no"/>tion, for the United states to rescue it from them, whether <lb/>on the high seas, or on coming into their ports. If the <lb/>commission was not valid and consequently, the property <lb/>not transferred by the laws of war, to the capture, then <lb/>the case would have been cognizable in our courts of ad<lb break="no"/>miralty, and the owners might have gone thither for re<lb break="no"/>dress. So that on neither supposition, would the execu<lb break="no"/>tive be justifiable in interposing.</p>
                <p>With respect to the United States, the transaction can <lb/>in no wise be imputed to them. It was in the first mo<lb break="no"/>ment of the war,ߝin one of the their most distant port.ߝbefore measures could be provided by the government to <lb/>meet all the cases, which such a state of things was to produce, impossible to have known, and therefore <lb/>impossible to have been prevented by that government.</p>
                <p>"The moment it was known, the most energetic or<lb break="no"/>ders were sent to every state and port in the union to pre<lb break="no"/>vent a repetition of the accident. On a suggestion, that <lb/>citizens of the United States had taken part in the act, one <lb/>who was designated, was instantly committed to prison, <lb/>for prosecution; one or two others have been since named, <lb/>and committed in like manner; and should it appear, that <lb/>there were still others, no measures would be spared to <lb/>bring them to justice. The President had even gone far<lb break="no"/>ther; He has required, as a reparation of their breach of <lb/>respect to the United States, that the vessels so armed and <lb/>equipped, shall depart from our ports.</p>
                <p>"You will see, Sir, in these proceedings of the Presi<lb break="no"/>dent, unequivocal proofs of the line of strict right, which <lb/>he means to pursue. The measures now mentioned, are <lb/>taken in justice to the one part; the ulterior measure of <lb/>seizing and restoring the prizes, is declined in justice to <lb/>the other; and the evil, thus early arrested, will be of <lb/>very limited effects; perhaps, indeed, soon disappear altogether."</p>
                <p> As to the permission from the governor of South Caro<lb break="no"/>lina, <supplied reason="copy blur">??? ??? departures of ??? privateers ??? ???,</supplied> you <cb/> may assure yourself of a proper inquiry; and I take the <lb/>liberty of requesting any evidence which you may have <lb/>of it</p>
                <p> 3. With so many direct proofs in your hands, of the <lb/>opinion constantly maintained by our government against <lb/>the legality of captures in general made by illegal priva<lb break="no"/>teers, it is not easily explained, why the validity of those <lb/>before the 5th of June, 1793, should be argued, from a <lb/>refusal to restore them. The above received letter of that <lb/>date, neither a<supplied reason="copy blur">ffi</supplied>rms nor disa<supplied reason="copy blur">ffirms</supplied> their validity; but de<lb break="no"/>clines the granting of restitutions being inconsistent with <lb/>the rules which govern such cases. Those ruled are <lb/>That if the commission be good, the capture is good; if <lb/>the commission be bad, the capture is bad; but whether <lb/>it be good or bad, is not decided; it being enough to <lb/>prove, that the transaction, for the reasons assigned, can in <lb/>no wise be imputed to the united States. But if captures <lb/>of this kind, prior to the 5th of June, 1792, do really a<lb break="no"/>mount (as is conceived by some) to no very considerable <lb/>value, this would of itself, lessen the importance of the in<lb break="no"/>sinuation.</p>
                <p>4th. The secretary of war has undertaken to ascertain <lb/>the precise state of the privateers le Petit Democrate and <lb/>la Carmagnole, and the result will be communicated to you. <lb/>In the mean time, it is a matter of some surprise, that <lb/>vessels, whose single employment and profit, must consist <lb/>in cruizing on the ocean, should have remained in the port <lb/>of New-York during the whole winter, and probably up <lb/>to the date of your letter (May 22d, 1794) May it not <lb/>be presumed, that their activity has been checked by the <lb/>intervention of the government? But, sir, if they have <lb/>not been dismantled, your letter brings the first notice of <lb/>the omission.</p>
                <p> 5th. It is true, that the sale of prizes made by French <lb/>cruizers, has not been prohibited in the United States, and <lb/>that our treaty with France has been so interpreted, as not <lb/>to contemplate a freedom to sell. The next resort was to <lb/>the law of nations; which was scrupulously searched by the <lb/>executive, with the pure desire of discovering truth and <lb/>justice to all. Upon this, as on many other occasions, the <lb/>civilians differ; Vattel declaring, That a privateer may car<lb break="no"/>ry his prize into a neutral port, and there freely sell it; <lb/>Martens affirming the same doctrine, if it has not been o<lb break="no"/>therwise regulated by treaty; and others opposing it. in <lb/>this sxhism among the writers,it was resolved by the Pre<lb break="no"/>sident of the United States, to impose no restraint upon <lb/>those sales; and to refer them; as affairs of legislation, to congress, at the earliest moment of their session. Thus <lb/>much has been observed, not as my final anser, but mere<lb break="no"/>ly to introduce an assurance, that I will follow you in the <lb/>main discussion, whensoever you shall bring it forward in <lb/>detail.</p>
                <p>6th. Undoubtedly, sir, you have been misinformed, that <lb/>the vessels of France have been permitted to depart from <lb/>our ports, notwithstanding the embargo. As the history <lb/>of the executive proceedings is neither long, nor entangled, <lb/>it shall be frankly stated to you. As soon as the embar<lb break="no"/>go was laid, expresses and advice boats were dispatched, to <lb/>notify the officer of the customs and revenue cutters, and <lb/>all others concerned in its execution. The resolution im<lb break="no"/>posing it, involved all foreign nations; the instructions <lb/>from the United States, favoured no nation, directly or in<lb break="no"/>directly. A French snow, La Camille, which had descend<lb break="no"/>ed the river Delaware as low as New-Castle on her voy<lb break="no"/>age, was stopped by an officer of the United States; and <lb/>the President, adhering to perfect impartiality could not <lb/>think himself justified, to gratify the Minister of the French Republic with a passport. Passports being kept under the <lb/>special view of the President were issued only after his ex<lb break="no"/>aminatino of each case, and the total number of them does <lb/>not exceed twenty-six. Among them, was one to your<lb break="no"/>self; one to an agent who was sent to the West-Indies, <lb/>upon a business connected with the late captures and con<lb break="no"/>demnation in various British courts of admiralty; one to a <lb/>citizen whose vessel was under trial in Bermuda, and who <lb/>was anxious to forward the British instructions of the 8th <lb/>January, 1794, with a hope of rescuing her from confis<lb break="no"/>cation; one to the friends of Joshua Barney then in Jami<lb break="no"/>ca; twenty for the accomodation of several unfortunate in<lb break="no"/>habitants of St. Domingo, to some of whome our govern<lb break="no"/>ment was advancing money for their support, and who could <lb/>no longer endure their separation from home; one to some <lb/>other persons in peculiar circumstances, desirous of return<lb break="no"/>ing to the West-Indies; and in the last instance, one to the <lb/>Minister of the French Republic. If, therefore, by any o<lb break="no"/>ther passport, or permission; the embargo has been relaxed, <lb/>it was unauthorized by the President, and unlawful. The <lb/>distance of Hampton Road from this city, being more than <lb/>three hundred miles, the officers of government, resident <pb n="2"/> here, could not learn, at the moment, what was passing <lb/>there. No intelligence of an official nature of any real im<lb break="no"/>portance. No complaint from any other foreign minister, <lb/>or any othe rpseron, has since reached us. If, Sir, you <lb/>should happen to possess the information, I ask it as a favour, of you, to designate, who granted the permission, and <lb/>under what circumstances the French vessels left that <lb/>road? An investigation, however, has been, and shall be <lb/>pursued, on our part, without delay. If the law has been <lb/>violated, it shall be vindicated; but a violation of law, is <lb/>very remote from a permission of the government.</p>
                <p> 7th. The uniformly unfriendly treatment which the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish officers are said to have experienced in the United <lb/>States, cannot be answered, until it shall be more explicitly <lb/>defined. Did this treatment break forth in words or ac<lb break="no"/>tions, not cognizable by law? If so, no complaint can be <lb/>offered to government. Or in words or action, which <lb/>were so cognizable? Our courts are free to foreigners a<lb break="no"/>gainst citizens, and independent of influence. To yourself <lb/>let me appeal, that on the representations, which you thought <lb/>proper to lay before the President, in relation to the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish consul at Baltimore, the British consul at Norfolk, and <lb/>the commander of the DȰdalus frigate, the necessary mea<lb break="no"/>sures were promptly adopted; the result has been trans<lb break="no"/>mitted to you, and no objection has been returned. Nor <lb/>was the government backward in its interference in the <lb/>late affair of Philadelphia. And these eing the only oc<lb break="no"/>currences of the kind within my knowledge, i trust, that <lb/>no example can be produced of government refusing to ex<lb break="no"/>tend its protection on every seasonable occasion.</p>
                <p>8th. The events at Newport, in Rhode-Island are ac<lb break="no"/>curately detailed in the proceedings, which I have the ho<lb break="no"/>nour of enclosing to you. Within the limits of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent letter, I cannot do more; as it might be an useless talk <lb/>to detain you with remarks, when non of them might be <lb/>adapted to the animadversions which you mediate. It is <lb/>enough, therefore, for me to engage, that these animadver<lb break="no"/>sions, whenever they shall appear, shall receive particular <lb/>attention.</p>
                <p>Although, Sir, your charges against the United States <lb/>are sketched only; the impression, which may have been <lb/>intended, cannot be counteracted too soon, by such general <lb/>elucidations, as at a future day may be more minutely un<lb break="no"/>folded. But let these facts be as they will; are they indi<lb break="no"/>cative of a hostile disposition in the United States, and <lb/>ought they ultimately to produce a state of war? This is <lb/>not the place for us to retort our complaints. But com<lb break="no"/>pare them with the whole of your catalogue; and say, what <lb/>may our feeling be? Yet we prefer peace.</p>
                <p>9th. As Lord Dorchester's endeavour to stir up the In<lb break="no"/>dians against us, is without justification; so is the expedi<lb break="no"/>tion of Governor Simcoe without pretext.</p>
                <p>That you have received no intelligence of such an event <lb/>having actually occurred, leaves room to conjecture, that <lb/>you may not be without intelligence of it having been de<lb break="no"/>signed; and that it has therefore probably taken place. <lb/>But you insist that much will depend on the place intend<lb break="no"/>ed for the fort. Let the point allotted for it on the Mia<lb break="no"/>mi, be unknown; the place is for our immediate purpose <lb/>adequatley market out by eing on the river. A single <lb/>glance of the eye over the map, proves that its source is <lb/>within the limits of the United States. In its whole length <lb/>it is flanked on each side by our territory. Its very mouth <lb/>is to the Southward of our line, as recognised by our trea<lb break="no"/>ty with his Britannic Majesty. On no part therefore of <lb/>the rapids can a fort be built, but within out country.</p>
                <p>This being fixed, your argument is, that if the fort be <lb/>for the purpose of protecting subjects of his majesty, resid<lb break="no"/>ing in districts, dependent on the fort of Detroit, or of pre<lb break="no"/>venting that fortress from being straitened by the approach <lb/>of the American army; the principle of <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>, until the final arrangement of the point in discussion between the <lb/>two countries shall be concluded, will strictly apply.</p>
                <p>To change by hostile movements the condition of a thing, <lb/>concerning which a treaty is opened, not being consonant <lb/>with the spirit of adjustment, the principle of <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>  has <lb/>been generally adopted. The nearest point of the rapids <lb/>to Detroit cannot be less than fifty miles. They have <lb/>never been considered, they never could be considered, as <lb/>appending to Detroit. But you proceed and say, tha tthe <lb/>proposed assumption of territory may depend on districts, <lb/>which depend on Detroit. It is too obvious to dwell up<lb break="no"/>on the remark, that if Detroit which lies within the Unit<lb break="no"/>ed States, becomes the first station from which a district may be generated, one encroachment may beget another <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">ad  <lb/>infinitum</hi>. It will, however, be very acceptable to un<lb break="no"/>derstand with accuracy, how much of our territory towards <lb/>the Miami was actually possessed by the military establish<lb break="no"/>ment of Detroit at the time of peace. I mention the mi<lb break="no"/>litary establishment; because if any subjects of his Britain<lb break="no"/>nic majesty reside beyond the line of actual possess, they <lb/>are, as being within our limits, under our jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>To prevent the fortress of Detroit from being straitened <lb/>by the approach of the American army, is either a new <lb/>modification of the preceding idea, or founded upon a un<lb break="no"/>tenable suspicion. For the question must recur, are the <lb/>rapids an appendage to Detroit? Were they connected <lb/>with it at the peace? If convenience only were to be con<lb break="no"/>sulted, and a wide range of unsettled territory, by being <lb/>suitable to the momentary circumstances of one nation, is <lb/>to be transferred for that reason alone from another, <cb/> which is the true proprietor, we might even then contro<lb break="no"/>vert the conveniency of the rapids to Detroit. If right be <lb/>consulted, our right is complete. Is then our territory to <lb/>be thus seized? Nay, more sir, I am authorized to say to <lb/>you explicitly, that the American army has no instruc<lb break="no"/>tions to straiten or annoy that post; and that if the descent on the rapids was dictated by this consideration, it ought <lb/>to be discontinued without cause.</p>

                <p> In the debate in Congress, on taking off the em<lb break="no"/>bargo, several members said they had voted for the <lb/>embargo, merely as a part of a general plan of re<lb break="no"/>taliation upon Great Britain; but that as the more <lb/>effential parts of that plan, particularly the prohi<lb break="no"/>biting of all commercial intercourse between Ame<lb break="no"/>rica and Great Britain had been over-ruled, the <lb/>embargo was injurious only to the subjects of teh <lb/>United States, and therefore ought to be taken off.</p>
                <p>In Philadelphia and several other ports, the mas<lb break="no"/>ters and mates of American ships held meetings, <lb/>and published resolutions, declaring that they would <lb/>not put to sea, until they could be assured that their <lb/>flag would be respected, and their persons <lb/>protected from such indignities as many of them had lately experienced. This they did after the <lb/>embargo was at an end.</p>

               <pb n="1"/>American papers are received, dated October, 4. <lb/> 1794. They contain two letters from General <lb/> Wayne to the American Secretary at War, giving <lb/> an account of a severe action he had with the Indi<lb break="no"/> ans, who were assisted by the volunteers and militia <lb/> of Detroit on the 20th August, on the banks of <lb/> the Miamis, in the vicinity of the British post and <lb/> garrison at the foot of the Rapids.–The action <lb/> was bloody, and he says, "our army was left in <lb/> full and quiet possession of the field of battle, which <lb/> terminated under the influence of the guns of the <lb/> British garrison, as you will observe by the inclosed <lb/> 
               <cb/> correspondence which passed between Major Camp<lb break="no"/> bell Commandant and myself upon the occasion." <lb/> He adds℃"We remained three days and nights <lb/> on the banks of the Miamis, in front of the field <lb/> of battle; during which time all the houses and <lb/> corn fields were consumed and destroyed for a con<lb break="no"/> siderable distance both above and below Fork Mia<lb break="no"/> mis, as well as within pistol shot of that garrison, <lb/> who were compelled to remain tacit spectators to <lb/> this general devastation and conflagration, among <lb/> which were the stores and houses of Colonel Mac<lb break="no"/> kee, the British Indian agent and principal stimu<lb break="no"/> lator of the war now exiting between the United <lb/> States and the Savages.</p>
                <p> The American paper from which this account <lb/> is taken, does not give the correspondence above <lb/> alluded to, but concludes the article thus: <lb/>
            </p>
                <p>"Besides the very important papers which we <lb/> have been able to offer to our readers this day, the <lb/> Executive, we understand, has received copies of a <lb/> correspondence between the British Major Camp<lb break="no"/> bell, and General Wayne. The Major begins it <lb/> by inquiring of the General by what authority he <lb/> came there. The General answers by requiring <lb/> to know who gave Campbell authority to establish <lb/> a fort at that place, it being within our side of the <lb/> treaty boundary, and no such establishment there <lb/> when that instrument was signed. We hope ere <lb/> long our gallant General will give a good account <lb/> of this Mr. Campbell."</p>

                <p>
               <pb n="6"/>"From some late communications it is evident, <lb/>that as much sugar may be made on the new lands <lb/>in the States of New-York and Pennsylvania as <lb/>will supply the whole United States, and perhaps <lb/>in a little time furnish an article of exportation. <lb/>The profits of the manufactory of sugar, when <lb/>made by private families, will be greater than <lb/>when made by large works. A boiler, which will <lb/>cost only 16s. will be the whole expence that will <lb/>be necessary to carry on this business, and the <lb/>sugar may be made at a season of the year when <lb/>no work can be done upon a farm. The price of <lb/>it, when sent to Philadelphia, will be twice as high <lb/>as the same quantity of wheat.  The sugar trees <lb/>may be made to yield their juice without being <lb/>injured, and when they decay, fresh ones may easily <lb/>be cultivated in the soil upon which they now <lb/>grow. When we consider the value of sugar, its <lb/>general and wholesome use in diet, and above all, <lb/>that it has hitherto been obtained at the price of <lb/>the lives and liberty of our African brethren, we <lb/>cannot help congratulating our fellow citizens <lb/>upon the prospect of manufactories of that article <lb/>being established among us, whereby immense sums <lb/>of money will be saved to our country, and, what <lb/>is more, our country freed from the guilt of en<lb break="no"/>couraging the detestable traffic in human crea<lb break="no"/>tures.</p>
                <p>"Several hundred sugar-kettles, we hear, are <lb/>now making in New Jersey, for the use of the <lb/>the New England settlers of the Susquehannahand Delaware."</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Vermont, Kentucky, Indiana</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">The Western Ter<lb break="no"/>ritory</hi>.</p>
                <p>About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wil<lb break="no"/>derness; they only began to settle it about the <lb/>year 1774. Kentucky, ten years ago, lay in fo<lb break="no"/>rest wild, it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid <lb/>has been the population, that there are not less <lb/>than one hundred thousand inhabitants, already, <lb/>in each of these States. The State of Indiana <lb/>was only laid off this present year 1789, and con<lb break="no"/>tains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From <lb/>a description of these four States, published in <lb/>American in May last, we give our readers a <lb/>short abridged description of the last of them, <lb/>called <hi rend="italic">The Western Territory</hi>; and it must re<lb break="no"/>rejoiced the heart of every Briton to read it, and <lb/>think, that the settling of these countries, though <lb/>the Americans double their numbers every 15 or <lb/>20 years, will long keep them from manufactur<lb break="no"/>ing, and is every day opening a field for new cus<lb break="no"/>tomers to Great Britain; for who will work as a <lb/>tradesman, even though wages are very high, <lb/>when he can, for twenty pounds, purchase a thou<lb break="no"/>sand acres of land, that being the present price <lb/>fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western <lb/>Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufac<lb break="no"/>tures will continually increase with the increasing <lb/>population of America.–Desponding politicians <lb/>may derive comfort from the prospect, that new <lb/>channels of commerce will be opened, and the in<lb break="no"/>land parts of the Continent will require an incres<lb break="no"/>ing supply.–British manufactures will for ages <lb/>ascend the great rivers of that Continent, and by <lb/>means of a most extraordinary inland navigation, <lb/>will be diffused through a country more fertile, <lb/>more susceptible  of population, and six time <lb/>more extensive, than all the Thirteen United <lb/>States.</p>

                <p>Is the name given to this new State by Congress. <lb/>It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi riverlb/&gt;–north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania– <lb/>south and south-east by the Ohio reiver; contains, <lb/>according to Mr. Hutchins, Geographer General <lb/>to the Congress, 411,000 square miles, equal to <lb/>two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres, <lb/>from which he deducts forty-three millions of <lb/>acres for water; there will then remain two hun<lb break="no"/>red and twenty millions of acres belonging to <lb/>the foederal government, which is to be sold for <lb/>the discharthe debt owing to the United <lb/>States. But a <lb/>very small proportion of these<cb/>lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and <lb/>disposed of by Congress*.</p>
                <p>On the lands which have been purchased by <lb/>Congress from the Indians two settlements and <lb/>already commenced*#x2013;one at Marietta, the other <lb/>at Miami.</p>
                <p>This State was only laid out by Congress in <lb/>the end of the year 1787, and already contains <lb/>about 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are <lb/>the Mississippi, Ohio, Muskingham, Hockhock<lb break="no"/>ing, Sioto, Miami, Wobash, &amp;c.–Coal and iron <lb/>mines, and salt pits, abound in this State; the <lb/>soil is excellent–as rich as can be imagined, and <lb/>may  be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little <lb/>or no labour. It is exceeding healthy, pleasant, <lb/>and commodious–the most fertile sport of earth <lb/> known to the Europeans or Americans–exceed<lb break="no"/>ing the soil of any of the United States. The <lb/>timber is tall, and in great variety.–Streams for <lb/>mills abound here. Wheat, indigo, hemp, and <lb/>cotton, thrive well. Many years will probably <lb/>not escape before a good part of the country will <lb/>be brought to that degree of cultivation that will <lb/>exhibit all its latent beauties, and justify the de<lb break="no"/>scrpition of travellers, who call it the *garden of <lb/>of a great empire will be fixed in some future pe<lb break="no"/>the world*. It is here probably also that the centre <lb/>riod. It is the most centrical place for Congress <lb/>to accomodate themselves at. No country is <lb/>better stocked with wild game of every kind; <lb/>herds of deers, elks, bear, &amp;c. fill the extensive <lb/>meadows of this country–turkies, geese, swans, <lb/>and partridges, &amp;c. are innumerable. The rivers <lb/>are excellently stored with fish, and almost all na<lb break="no"/>vigable for small sloops.</p>
                <p>In the ordinance published by Congress for <lb/>the government of this territory, they are to <lb/>be allowed an Assembly when their number a<lb break="no"/>mounts to 30,000 persons' and when they ac<lb break="no"/>quire a certain degree of population they are to <lb/>have representatives in Congress; and when fifty <lb/>millions of acres are settled they are to be divided <lb/>into States.</p>
                <p>Rejoice, O Britons! that they must all be sup<lb break="no"/>plied with manufactures by you, and you *only*</p>
                <p>*No more than about twelve millions of acres have <lb/>yet been purchased of the poor natives, for which Con<lb break="no"/>gress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods <lb/>and rum.</p>

               <pb n="2"/>By an extract of a letter from <region n="3489940">Jamaica</region> we learn <lb/>the following singular fact;–The Captain and <lb/>crew of the brig Exuma, which arrived there <lb/>some days before from <region n="6354959">Newfoundland</region>, hav<lb break="no"/>ing in the course of their passage fallen in with a French schooner, Captain Alward asked the <lb/>Captain of the schooner to accommodate him <lb/>with some nails, which he politely did; at the <lb/>same time begging his acceptance of some barra<lb/>coutes caught that morning. Captain Aylward <lb/>and his crew having dined off them the same day, <lb/>they were immediately seized with violent sickness <lb/>convulsive fits, and other dangerous symptoms. <lb/>The Captain, judging that the fish they had ea<lb break="no"/>ten were of a poisonous nature, conceived that <lb/>salt water might be of service, he instantly made <lb/>the expedient on himself, which relieved him <lb/>greatly ; he applied the same remedy to his crew <lb/>and it was attended with good effects. When <lb/>this unfortunate accident happened, it was luc<lb break="no"/>kily a dead calm ; had the weather been tempes<lb break="no"/>tous, it is more than probable the ship and crew <lb/>would have been lost, as during their sickness, there was not a man able to stand by the helm.</p>

               <pb n="6"/>By letters received from <settlement n="4776222">Norfolk</settlement> in <region n="6254928">Virginia</region>, <lb/>dated the 23rd of July, we learn that on the 10th <lb/>of that month the ship Betsey of Greenock, Capt. <lb/>James Young, had arrived there in 19 days from <lb/>
               <region n="3489940">Jamaica</region>, and brought the following melancholy <lb/>relation which he received from the crew of the <lb/>Prudence, whom she picked up on the 1st of Ju<lb break="no"/>in lat. 22. 40. long. 85. 32. That from the <lb/>7th to the 10th of June the weather had been <lb/>very hazy, with little wind, so that Capt Addies <lb/>could not get an observation, and a strong cur<lb break="no"/>rent setting to the Southward and Westward, <lb/>drove them farther leeward than they imagined. <lb/>On the 12th, about 3 o'clock in the morning, the <lb/>watch discovered Cape Catuloh, but before intel<lb break="no"/>ligence could be given to the Captain, she struck. <lb/> For some time she made no water but about se<lb break="no"/>ven the water came in so fast, that by eleven <lb/>o'clock, A. M. the water was six feet in the <lb/>hold (the depth of the water in which she lay,) the people being sixteen in number, took to their <lb/>long boat, and endeavoured to make Cape Anto<lb break="no"/>nie; but after four days fruitless labour they <lb/>were obliged to return to the wreck, where they found two Spaniards plundering, who informed <lb/>them that there were only four inhabitants on the <lb/>island, and therefore they could receive no assist<lb break="no"/>ance from them; upon which, having taken a <lb break="no"/>quantity of beef and biscuits aboard, they left the <lb/>wreck a second time, and after having been ab<lb break="no"/>sent fourteen days, were providentially picked up <lb/>by the ship Betsey, and carried to <settlement n="4776222">Norfolk</settlement> in <lb/>
               <region n="6254928">Virginia</region>.</p>
                <p>The Prudence was from <region n="3489940">Jamaica</region>, bound to <lb/>
               <settlement n="2643743">London</settlement>, and had upwards of 500 hogsheads of <lb/>sugar and rum on board.</p>
