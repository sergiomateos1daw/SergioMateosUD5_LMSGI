               <hi rend="smallcaps">Canada  <lb/>Lord Selkirk</hi>
            </p>
                <p>We have been favoured by a Gentleman in this city, with the <lb/>following interesting and authentic communication, on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of the dispute between Lord Selkirk, and the Gentlemen of <lb/>the North West Company:</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Extract of a Letter from Montreal, dated 6th October, </hi>
               <lb/>1816.</p>
                <p>"In the newspapers which I sent you, you will see some <lb/>accounts of the disturbances which have taken place in the North <lb/>West between the North West Company and Lord Selkirk's co<lb break="no"/>lonists. The latter have been obliged to leave the Red River, <lb/>after having had 22 of their men, including Governor Semple, <lb/>killed by a party of <hi rend="italic">half-breeds,</hi>  the spurious offspring of the <lb/>North West Company. As yet have not had an accurate <lb/>statement of that melancholy transaction. Lord Selkirk's party <lb/>state that these half-breed with some of the North West Com<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>pany servants, came to destroy the settlement, and that Mr <lb/>Semple, with about 25 of the Colonists, went out to meet them, <lb/>to know what could be their intentions, when those rascals com<lb break="no"/>menced firing on them, and massacred all but three, who were for<lb break="no"/>tunate enough to make their escape. The North West people's <lb/>account is that these <hi rend="italic">half-breeds</hi>  with some <hi rend="italic">Indians</hi>  were bring<lb break="no"/>ing down provisions from the upper part of the Red River to the <lb/>entrance near Lake Winipie, and as the Colonists had the com<lb break="no"/>mand of a great part of the river, they were obliged to pass in the <lb/>rear of the settlement, which being observed by Governor Sem<lb break="no"/>ple, who was on the look-out for them, he settled out of his Fort <lb/>with 25 men and a [?]-piece to take from the Indians the pro<lb break="no"/>visions which were intended for the North West Company ; that <lb/>the result[?] was an engagement which terminated in the defeat of <lb/>the Colonists, of whom twenty-two were killed. Lord Selkirk <lb/>[?] from Montreal for the Red River about the latter end of <lb/>June, when[?] three or four officers and about 150 men of De Men<lb break="no"/>[?]'s regiment, which had been disbanded, and when he arrived <lb/>at Fort William on Lake Superior, hearing the fate of his Colon<lb break="no"/>ists, he[?] immediately issued a warrant against Mr M'Gillivray for <lb/>high treason, conspiracy and murder, and subsequently warrants a<lb break="no"/>gainst all the partners of the N. W. Company, who were at F Wil<lb break="no"/>liam, [?] formal possession of their establishment there, and sent <lb/>Mr M'Gillivray, with about ten others, prisoners to Montreal, with <lb/>all their papers [?] a number of packs of Beaver and other Furs, <lb/>and several bales[?] of Merchandise, which he found in possession of <lb/>the North West Company, belonging to the Hudson's Bay Com<lb break="no"/>pany. The Police Officers in Montreal were several days exa<lb break="no"/>mining the papers, and about four or five days after the arrival of <lb/>Mr M'Gillivray and the others, they were admitted to bail, to ap<lb break="no"/>pear to take their trial at the next criminal court, or any court of <lb/>Oyer and Terminer which may be appointed. Stuart (the ci-de<lb break="no"/> vant Solicitor-General, who was dismissed by Sir James Craig, <lb/>and at whose instance an ineffectual attempt was lately made by <lb/>some misguided members of our House of Assembly to impeach <lb/>Chief Justices Sewell and Monk) is one of Lord Selkirk's coun<lb break="no"/>sel and spoke at great length, and what his friends and admi<lb break="no"/>rers call very eloquently, strongly opposed their being admitted <lb/>to bail, but all would not do, and they were accordingly bailed ; <lb/>Mr M'Gillivray in sureties of t1000 and the others in t500, <lb/>sums inconsiderable enough, advering to the high crimes and <lb/>misdemeanours with which they were charged.</p>
                <p>"In the <hi rend="italic">Montreal Herald</hi>  you will see a very learned, and (as <lb/>our neighbour Jonathan would say) a <hi rend="italic">lengthy</hi>  communication, <lb/>signed <hi rend="italic">Montius[?]</hi>, setting forth the rights which the Hudson's <lb/>Bay Company by their charter possess over the Countries which <lb/>they have granted to Lord Selkirk, and the power vested in him <lb/>of appointing Governors and other Officers to superintend and <lb/>regulate the Colony. Being a masterly production, it will no <lb/>doubt makes its appearance in a pamphlet, and when it does, I <lb/>shall send you one, in case the papers should miscarry. It is un<lb break="no"/>certain whether the Earl will remain in the North West during <lb/>the winter, or come down to Montreal ; if the latter, he must be <lb/>down[?] soon[?], as the season for water-travelling will shortly close.</p>
                <p>"Montreal is now divided into two parties, one favouring the <lb/>Lord, and the other the North West Company ; and with the ex<lb break="no"/>ception of the friends of the latter, strongly in favour of his <lb/>Lordship."</p>

            </p>
                <p>"We sincerely hope that the Duties Government had in con<lb break="no"/>templation (last year) to impose upon Timber imported into <lb/>Great Britain and Ireland, from the British North American <lb/>Provinces, equal to the additional duty imposed on Foreign <lb/>Timber in 1813 will be further suspended.</p>
                <p>"Our[?] commercial system chiefly depends upon the encourage<lb break="no"/>ment of the Timber branch ; ships that carry away that article[?] <lb/>bring us [?] at a low freight, whereby we are enabled to furnish <lb/>the British West India Islands with an abundant supply of Fish[?], <lb/>and that on very moderate terms ; but, in the event of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment persisting in imposing the Duty on Timber from hence, <lb/>that branch of our trade will inevitably revert to the Americans, <lb/>besides being the ruin of many in this and in the neighbouring <lb/>Provinces.</p>
                <p>"The supposed revenue that would accrue to the mother <lb/>country, upon trial, will be found delusive ; to prove this, many <lb/>obvious[?] reasons can be adduced : As the trade now exists, all the <lb/>Timber extracted from these Colonies to Great Britain and Ire<lb break="no"/>land is paid for in British Manufactures ; the export of so bulky <lb/>an article as Timber, and the import of so ponderous an article <lb/>as [?], employs[?] an immense number of British ships ; objects <lb/>certainly of more real value to the revenue of Britain than any <lb/>benefit they could possibly derive from direct Duties imposed on <lb/>the export of Timber from British North America. It cannot be <lb/>denied that previous to 1813, when the additional Duty was laid <lb/>on Foreign Timber, they (the Foreigners) were not only the <lb/>carriers, but would not accept an ounce of British Manufac<lb break="no"/>ture in payment for their TImber–no, nothing but you gold[?] <lb/>which was so much in demand, that 28s. was given for a [?]. <lb/>Another very cogent reason [?] be advanced in favour of what <lb/>is commonly denominated the Timber Trade from these Provin<lb break="no"/>ces ; it facilitates emigration, and introduces many valuable set<lb break="no"/>tlers into this Province, and the Canadas, that would go to the <lb/>States of America ; and the day is perhaps not so far distant when <lb/>they would of accessity[?] become our enemies.</p>
                <p>"When Great Britain was first involved in war with the eas<lb break="no"/>tern countries, from whence the principal supply of Timber was <lb/>derived, the merchants in that line[?], as well as the ship-masters <lb/>were not only alarmed, but convinced themselves ruined ! The <lb/>Baltic is shut[?], what shall we do for Timber, and with our ships? <lb/>They properly concluded that perhaps the British Provinces could <lb/>supply them ; they made the experiment, they were not disap<lb break="no"/>pointed–but succeeded far beyond their expectations. If there<lb break="no"/>fore, in time of war, Britain has took to her colonies for a sup<lb break="no"/>ply of such a necessary article as Wood ; it is not reasonable for <lb/>us to conclude that their interests will not be wholly neglected, <lb/>when blessed with peace."</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Extract of a Letter, dated Savannah, 25th Nov.</hi>  1817</p>
                <p>"In the Southern States, this autumn has been the most fa<lb break="no"/>tal they have experienced since their colonization. Many thou<lb break="no"/>sands have been hurried off to that " narrow house" destined <lb/>for all that live. A most malignant fever has prevailed to an <lb/>alarming extent. In this city, during the last four months, the <lb/>deaths have been equal to one-eights of the inhabitants left in <lb/>it ; and in Beaufort (S. Carolina) and in some of the Southern <lb/>Counties, the morality has exceeded one-sixth!"</p>

                <p>By the Henry, arrived in the rive from Quebec, we <lb/>have advices from thence of the 4th September, three <lb/>days later than the last accounts. They confirm, we <lb/>regret to say, the intelligence received at Lloyd's on <lb/>Friday, of the death of the Duke of Richmond, at <lb/>Montreal, where he had arrived on his return from in<lb break="no"/>specting the new settlements in Upper Canada. His <lb/>body had been brought from Montreal to Quebec, <lb/>where it was lying in state at the time the Henry sail<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>ed. His daughter Lady Mary Lennox, continued in <lb/>the most afflicting state, and great fears were entertain<lb break="no"/>ed for her recovery.</p>
                <p>Lady Sarah Lennoc, his Grace's second daughter, <lb/>is married to Major-General Sir Peregrine Maitland. <lb/>They accompanied his grace to North America, and <lb/>have remained there since he entered upon his Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. His Grace was the lineal descendant of the <lb/>first Duke of Richmond, natural son of King Charles <lb/>II. by a French Lady, who was created by his Majesty <lb/>Duchess of Portsmouth, and by Louis the Fourteenth, <lb/>Duchess of Aubigny, in France. His titles were, <lb/>Duke of Richmond, Early of March (English ho<lb break="no"/>nours) ; Duke of Aubigny, (French Honour) ; Duke <lb/>of Lennox, Early of Darnley, and Baron Methuen of <lb/>Torbulton (Scots Honours). The title of Aubigny was <lb/>confirmed in March 1816, by Louis XVIII by caus<lb break="no"/>ing the estate of Aubigny to be assigned to him, and <lb/>granting him the honours of the Louvre, as enjoyed by <lb/>his Grace's ancestors. He was a Lieutenant-General <lb/>in the army, Colonel of the 35th regiment of foot, Go<lb break="no"/>nervor of Plymouth, Governor of Upper and Lower <lb/>Canada and their dependencies, Lord Lieutenant of <lb/>the county of Sussex, and High Steward of Chichester. <lb/>–His Grace was born in 1764, succeeded his uncle, <lb/>Charles, the late Duke, in 1806, and married in 1783 <lb/>Charlotte, daughter of Duke of Gordon, by whom <lb/>he had issue seven sons and seven daughters, all of them <lb/>now living, except his third son, Henry Adam, R. N. <lb/>who fell overboard the Blake, as she was sailing into <lb/>Port Mahon, in 1812, and was drowned. His Grace <lb/>was distinguished early in life by a duel with His <lb/>Royal Highness the Duke of York. He was of an <lb/>open, candid, generous temper, and of plain and un<lb break="no"/>affected manners, qualities which were particularly con<lb break="no"/>spicuous in Ireland, when Viceroy of that country.</p>
                <p>His Grace is succeeded in the Peerage his eldest <lb/>son Charles, Earl of March, now Duke of Richmond. <lb/>This young Nobleman in the army, has seen much active ser<lb break="no"/>vice under the personal auspices of the illustrious Wel<lb break="no"/>lington, being one of his Grace's Aides-de-camp, and <lb/>was one of the Representatives in Parliament for the <lb/>City of Chichester, which seat, of course, becomes va<lb break="no"/>cant. He was lately married to the eldest daughter of <lb/>the Marquis of Anglesea, and has issue, a Son, now <lb/>Earl of March.</p>
                <p>The following is extracted from the Quebec papers:</p>
                <p>"Quebec, Thursday, Sept. 2. <lb/>"This Province has again been visited by one of <lb/>those afflicting dispensations of Providence, which by <lb/>separating by the hand of death, the ruler from the <lb/>people, covers whole communities with mourning.</p>
                <p>"An express arrived here yesterday morning from <lb/>Montreal, with the afflicting intelligence chief that his Grace <lb/>the Duke of Richmond, Governor in Chief of these <lb/>Provinces, had died on his way from Kingston to Mon<lb break="no"/>treal, at the moment that he was hourly expected to <lb/>join his family there, from which he had separated in <lb/>good health at Kingston, one the 20th, to complete by <lb/>visiting the new Settlements, the long and arduous <lb/>journey in which he has been engaged.</p>
                <p>This melancholy and utterly unexpected intelli<lb break="no"/>gence, spread with the greatest rapidity, and impressed <lb/>a deep gloom throughout the city. The flag on the <lb/>citadel, and on all the vessels in the port, was hoisted <lb/>half-mast, exhibiting every where the signals of public <lb/>mourning.</p>
                <p>"His Grace's body, immediately after his death, <lb/>was conveyed to Montreal. It reached this city last <lb/>evening in the steam-boat <hi rend="italic">Malsham</hi>, and was remov<lb break="no"/>ed this forenoon to the Castle, with the usual military <lb/>honours, and followed by his Grace's Staff, the prin<lb break="no"/>cipal Civil and Military Officers in the City and Gar<lb break="no"/>rison, and a great concourse of mourning inhabitants."</p>
                <p>September 5. <lb/>"His Grace's remains were conveyed from Montreal <lb/>to Quebec, in a steam-boat. At ten o'clock, one the <lb/>morning of the 2d of Sept. they were removed from the <lb/>vessel, and placed upon a hearse upon the King's Wharf <lb/>at Quebec, from whence it was conveyed to the Cha<lb break="no"/>teau of St. Louis, where they lay in state until four o'<lb break="no"/>clock on Saturday the 4th September, when they were <lb/>removed to the place of internment in the Cathedral <lb/>Church at Quebec.</p>
                <p>"On the corpse being brought out, the collar and <lb/>insignia of the Order of the Garter, with his Grace's <lb/>military and other appointments being placed on the cof<lb break="no"/>fin, the whole of the troops presented arms. On its being <lb/>placed on the hearse, the troops rested on their arms <lb/>reversed.</p>
                <p>"The procession then moved forward. It was com<lb break="no"/>posed of all the principals persons attached to the pub<lb break="no"/>lic, military and civil departments.</p>
                <p>"The military band filed off at the door of the Ca<lb break="no"/>thedral Church-yard and conducted it up the centre <lb/>aisle, when it was played on a platform, the mourners <lb/>remaining by the body. A signal was then given, when <lb/>the body was deposited – 15 guns being fired."</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter, dated Quebec, Sept 5 :–" When <lb/>I wrote the first side, I did not expect so soon to com<lb break="no"/>municate the melancholy event of the death of our Go<lb break="no"/>vernor, the Duke of Richmond, who was attacked on his <lb/>route from Upper Canada, with symptoms of hydro<lb break="no"/>phobia, which terminated his mortal career at six miles <lb/>from the settlement of Richmond. He was perfectly <lb/>sensible of his situation, and gave himself up from the <lb/>first spasm which attacked : it was occasioned by <lb/>a bite of a tame fox at Sorel, on his way to Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, about three months since. His death, at this <lb/>juncture, is looked on as very unfortuante for this coun<lb break="no"/>try, as he possessed the entire confidence of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and was about completing a plan of defence for <lb/>the Canadas, which, when executed, would establish a <lb/>water communication with our extreme points, per<lb break="no"/>fectly free from interruption, in case of a war with the <lb/>States."</p>
                <p>We are happy to learn, further, that no part of his <lb/>Grace's family was so dangerously ill, as was at first <lb/>reported. They are only in that situation which might <lb/>be expected, from so severe an affliction.</p>
                <p>Colonel Wilson had succeeded the late Duke of Rich<lb break="no"/>mond as Governor-General of both Canadas, being the <lb/>senior Officer on that station.</p>
                <p>Sir Charles Saxton, and Major M'Leod, Aides-de<lb break="no"/>Camp to his Grace the Duke of Richmond, have gone <lb/>to Lake Winnipeg, clothed with special powers, to in<lb break="no"/>vestigate the causes of the unhappy dissentions which <lb/>are said to have been lately renewed in that quarter <lb/>between the North West and Hudson's Bay Company. <lb/>By the new act, regulating the commercial intercourse <lb/>between the province of Upper Canada and the United <lb/>States, the duties on the importation of manufactures <lb/>and provisions from the States are considerably reduc<lb break="no"/>ed on [?] of the enumerated articles, although on <lb/>nails, snuff, manufactured tobacco, and spirits, they are <lb/>riased. The <hi rend="italic">ad-valorem[?]</hi>  duty is reduced from 10 to 5 <lb/>per cent.</p>
                <p>Buffalo, Aug. 4. <lb/>On Friday, came[?] on before the Court of King's <lb/>Beach, at Niagara, the trial of Robert Gourlay, Esq. <lb/>for a misdemeanour, in not obeying the orders of the <lb/>Magistrates at Niagara, in December last. Mr Gour<lb break="no"/>lay was found guilty, and banished the province.</p>
                <p>From the Quebec Gazette of 26th August: This <lb/>morning, about 9 o'clock, Lieut. Birch, of the royal <lb/>navy, put a period to his existence by shooting himself <lb/>through the head. We are informed that Mr Birch <lb/>had for sometime previous to his death laboured under <lb/>a melancholy state of mind. An amiable[?] wife and one <lb/>child are the survivors[?] of this awful [?] <cb/>The Annual Report of the Agricultural Society of <lb/>Quebec has been published from which it is evident <lb/>that a laudable spirit of enterprise has been awakened <lb/>in that important country. The Committee, who, in <lb/>the execution of their functions travelled through the <lb/>greater part of Lower Canada, conclude their Report by <lb/>putting on record a testimony they justly conceive to be <lb/>honourable to the character of the inhabitants of the <lb/>country through which they passed. Although many <lb/>hundreds of persons from all parts of their respective <lb/>Counties attended the Agricultural Meetings, which <lb/>were frequently of four or five hours duration, there <lb/>did not occur at any of them a single instance of in<lb break="no"/>toxication, disorderly conduct or personal altercation.</p>
                <p>The Grand Jury at Nassau, New Providence, have <lb/>brought in a bill against Sir Gregor M'Gregor, charging <lb/>him with aiding and abetting piracy, by issuing com<lb break="no"/>missions in the Bahamas, to subjects of Power in <lb/>unity[?] with Spain.</p>
                <p>A letter from Sierra Leone, dated the 9th of March <lb/>says–" It is with the deepest regret I inform you <lb/>that, notwithstanding the liberality of Great Britain, <lb/>and the faith of Treaties, the coasts swarms with slave <lb/>vessels, dragging thousnads of its miserable inhabitants <lb/>into endless captivity. A few days ago arrived here <lb/>the Union, of Liverpool : the Supercargo states, that <lb/>during his stay in the river Calabia, not less than eight <lb/>vessels, averaging 500 slaves each, had sailed for the <lb/>Spanish Colonies."</p>
                <p>We have received <hi rend="italic">Gibraltar Chronicles</hi>  to the 10th <lb/>ult. from which we learn that, in consequence of the <lb/>rapid increase of the fever at the Isle de Leon, his Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency Governor Don had issued a Proclamation on <lb/>the 2d ult. announcing that all communications with <lb/>Spain (except through the customary process of qua<lb break="no"/>tine) would close at sun-set on the following even<lb break="no"/>ing. Notice was also given to such of the labouring <lb/>classes as had not passed the fever, that they would be <lb/>provided with tents and encamped on the neutral ground <lb/>for their better security against infection should it un<lb break="no"/>happily appears in the fortress. They would not be suffered <lb/>to proceed to town, and follow their callings, during <lb/>the day, but heir return to the encampment at night <lb/>was peremptorily enjoined.</p>
                <p>We are happy to learn, however, by the latest advices <lb/>from the British fortress, that the garrison and inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants were not at all infected with the disease.</p>

                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Lord Selkirk vs. North West Company</hi>.</p>
                <p>On Friday, the 30th of October, the Court of Oyer <lb/>and Terminer proceeded to try the gentlemen accused <lb/>as necessaries to the murder of Robert Semple, Esq. <lb/>and others at Red River, on the 19th of June, 1816 <lb/>and the trial was rendered extremely interesting by the <lb/>disclousure which took place of many extraordinary cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances connected with the Hudson's Bya and <lb/>North West Companies, which for some time past has <lb/>excited so much of the public attention in this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince. The gentlemen tried on this occasion were, <lb/>Messrs. Alexander Mackenzie, <lb/>Hugh M'Gillis, <lb/>Simon Fraser, <lb/>John Macdonald, and <lb/>John M'Laughlin <lb/>} accused as accessories <lb/>after the fact. <lb/>and Mr John Severlight, accused as an accessory <hi rend="italic">before </hi>
               <lb/>and <hi rend="italic">after</hi>  the fact.</p>
                <p>It appeared in evidence that the North West Com<lb break="no"/>pany had been upwards of thirty years in possession <lb/>of trading posts called <hi rend="italic">forts</hi>  at different points on the <lb/>Red River in the Indian Territories, and it is well <lb/>known that for a century before the North West Com<lb break="no"/>pany, the Canadian for traders had been in the con<lb break="no"/>stant practise of resorting to that country which was <lb/>visited for the first time by traders of the Hudson's <lb/>Bay Company about twenty-five years ago. It was <lb/>put in evidence that for many years afterwards both <lb/>companies carried on their trade to Red River without <lb/>interference in each others pursuits, and without any <lb/>disturbance in the country ; and it was explained that <lb/>the principal object of the trade being to collect pro<lb break="no"/>visions, (enlisting chiefly of the dried flesh of the buf<lb break="no"/>falo, which abound in the plains) and the country pro<lb break="no"/>ducing abundance for the supply of both parties, the <lb/>same causes of dissention did not exist as at trading <lb/>stations where the fine furs are obtained in small quan<lb break="no"/>tities, and where rival traders would at all times be <lb/>likely to dispute about the divisions of them. The Red <lb/>River country therefore remained quiet and undisturb<lb break="no"/>ed until the arrival of the Earl of Selkirk's Colonists <lb/>and Servants, and the attempts made by their leaders <lb/>to prevent the usual supplies of provisions from being <lb/>obtained by the traders.</p>
                <p>The proclamation of Miles Macdonnell the soi-dis<lb break="no"/>ant <hi rend="italic">Governor of Ossinibour</hi>, prohibiting the exporta<lb break="no"/>tion of provisions from Red River, was the first docu<lb break="no"/>ment produced for the defence at the recent trials. It <lb/>was proved that, under this assumed authority, several <lb/>acts of violence were committed by Mr Macdonnell and <lb/>his followers. Trading posts and buildings were for<lb break="no"/>cibly entered, depots of provisions seized, the river (the <lb/>only outlet from the country) blockaded by batteries <lb/>mounted with cannon, and the trade of the North <lb/>West Company wholly interdicted, before any acts of <lb/>retaliation were attempted on their part, and even be<lb break="no"/>fore they took any precautions for their own defence <lb/>or for ensuring the safety of their provisions, on which <lb/>depended the existence of their trade, and the lives of <lb/>their people.</p>
                <p>Mutual and continual acts of aggression and ret<lb break="no"/>aliation appeared to have exasperated the minds of both <lb/>parties, and to have rendered them so suspicious of the <lb/>designs of each other as to be always on their guard <lb/>and prepared for defence. In short it appeared in <lb/>evidence that the country remained in a state of pri<lb break="no"/>vate war, which at length ended in the <hi rend="italic">battle</hi>  of the <lb/>loch of Jane, 1816. The particulars of this unfort<lb break="no"/>unate affray were fully investigated in the trial of Bouche <lb/>and Brown for murder, as <hi rend="italic">principals</hi>. The state<lb break="no"/>ments on both sides are already before the public, and <lb/>the acquittal of the prisoners shows sufficiently that the <lb/>jury considered Mr Semple and his party to have been <lb/>the assailants. On the trial of the alleged accessories <lb/>the cirumstances which led to the meeting of the hos<lb break="no"/>tile parties were made out in the evidence to the following <lb/>effect, viz : –</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">March</hi>, 1816, Mr Colin Robertson, with an <lb/>armed party, acting under the orders of <hi rend="italic">Governor </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">Semple</hi>, who had succeeded <hi rend="italic">Governor</hi>  Miles Macdonnell <lb/>at Red River, captured by surprise the North West <lb/>trading post at the forks of the river, called <hi rend="italic">Fort </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">Gibraltar</hi>, and took possession of all the stores and <lb/>provisions. In the latter part of the following month <lb/>of May, Governor Semple caused the buildings (which <lb/>were of wood) to be taken to pieces, and the materials <lb/>were floated fown the river in rafts, to be used in con<lb break="no"/>structing his new fort, which he called <hi rend="italic">Fort Douglas </hi>
               <lb/>and where, (following the examples of his predecessors) <lb/>he mounted cannon to command the passage of the <lb/>river, built an armed schooner, or gun-boat, to com<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>plete the blockage, and effectually to intercept the pro<lb break="no"/>visions and trade of the North West Company. Mr. <lb/>Alexander Macdonnell, a partner of the North West <lb/>Company, who had charge of their provisions at Ri<lb break="no"/>viere Qui Appele, one of the branches of the Red River, <lb/>became alarmed at these measures of hostility, and as<lb break="no"/>sembled as many people as he could (half breeds and <lb/>others) for the protection of the property under his care, <lb/>with which, at the usual time, he proceeded down the <lb/>river till he arrived within sixty miles of Governor <lb/>Semple's fort. He then landed his provisions, made <lb/>dispositions to defend them, if attacked, and sent a <lb/>party of his people, with a temporary supply to meet <lb/>the canoes from below, apprise them of the blockages, <lb/>and concert with them the means of eluding or re<lb break="no"/>moving it. This party, under the direction of Cuth<lb break="no"/>bert Grant (a half breed, and a clerk of the N. West <lb/>Company) was ordered to land above Fort Douglas <lb/>in order to keep out of the reach of the cannon, and <lb/>to carry these provisions in carts, at as great a distance <lb/>as possible from the fort, so as to avoid being seen.– <lb/>This it was fully proved they did ; but a swamp in the <lb/>rear of the fort compelled them to pass within about <lb/>two miles of it, and being deserted and pursued from <lb/>then, the conflict ensued in which Mr Semple, and <lb/>most of his party, were killed.</p>
                <p>It was further made out in evidence that in the <lb/>Spring of the year 1816, the agent of the North West <lb/>Company at Montreal were still in need of more than <lb/>the usual supply of provisions from the Red River, be<lb break="no"/>cause there had not yet been time to replace the ves<lb break="no"/>sels on the lakes, and the other means of transport <lb/>which the Americans had destroyed during the war, <lb/>nor to replenish their stores at Fort William, with the <lb/>usual quantity of provisions from Canada. Having <lb/>also heard of the seizure of one of their posts at Red <lb/>River in the fall of the year 1815, and apprehending <lb/>further aggressions in the spring, Mr M'Leod, one of <lb/>the agents, with all the partners and clerks who could <lb/>be spared from Montreal, proceeded up the country <lb/>early in the Spring, and on arriving at Fort William, <lb/>received intelligence of the capture of Fort Gibraltar <lb/>and the blockade of Red River, towards which place <lb/>he immediately proceeded with as many of the part<lb break="no"/>ners, clerks, and servants of the Company as he could <lb/>collect by the way, in order to rescue the intercepted <lb/>provisions, in the defence of which, or in their own <lb/>defence, if fired on by Semple's blockading battery, it <lb/>was their avowed purpose to use force if necessary, but <lb/>it was distinctly proved that their intentions and orders <lb/>issued to their cannonmen, were, to pass Fort Douglas <lb/>singing, and to proceed up the river for their provi<lb break="no"/>sions, without landing or molesting any one unless <lb/>they should be attacked.–They arrived at Red River <lb/>three days after the battle, and Mr M'Leod, who was <lb/>a Magistrate, being of opinion that Mr Semple's party <lb/>had been the assailants, and that the half breeds had <lb/>only acted in self defence, did not adopt any measures <lb/>against them, (the half breeds) but, on the contrary, <lb/>expressed approbation for their having defended their <lb/>provisions, and gave them the supplies of clothing, &amp;c. <lb/>usually given to all the servants of the North West <lb/>Company, while, at the same time, he arrest some <lb/>of the survivors of Mr Semple's party, and served sub<lb break="no"/>poenas upon others to give evidence of these transactions <lb/>in the Courts of Lower Canada. <cb/>This was the whole of the evidence, and the only <lb/>circumstances which appeared relative to the prisoners, <lb/>were that Mr Sevewright (the alleged accessory before <lb/>the fact) was with Mr Alexander Macdonnell when he <lb/>sent off Grant and his party to escort the provisions <lb/>past Fort Douglas, and that the alleged accessaries <lb/>after the fact arrived at Red River with Mr M'Leod, <lb/>after the battle was over, and appeared to consider it, <lb/>as it is now found to have been, an affray in which the <lb/>unsuccessful party were to blame, and in which the <lb/>successful party <hi rend="italic">were not murderers</hi> –The Judge who <lb/>presided at the trial, declared in his charge to the jury <lb/>that there was not a <hi rend="italic">scintilla</hi>  of evidence " against any <lb/>one of these gentlemen," and the jury accordinagly re<lb break="no"/>turned a verdict of <hi rend="italic">Not Guilty</hi>.</p>
                <p>It will be recollected that these gentlemen were ar<lb break="no"/>rested by the Earl of Selkirk, at Fort William, in Aug <lb/>1815, on the charges of High Treason and Conspi<lb break="no"/>racy, as well as Murder–and that the buildings and <lb/>property of the North West Company at that place <lb/>were forcibly seized and subsequently retained by an <lb/>armed force under his Lordship's command. The <lb/>North West Company represented at the time that these <lb/>accusations were merely a pretext set up to palliate the <lb/>preconcerted plunder of their property, and destruction <lb/>of their trade, while, on the part of Lord Selkirk, it <lb/>was alleged that the crimes committed by the partners <lb/>of the North West Company were so atrocious, as to <lb/>justify his Lordship's proceedings against them ; and <lb/>for some time the public opinion remained in suspense <lb/>as to the real merits of the case. So far as regarded <lb/>the seizure of property and the interruption of trade, <lb/>the point was decided by the Prince Regent's Procla<lb break="no"/>mation of the 3rd of May, 1817, in consequence of <lb/>which the North West Company recovered possession <lb/>of their property, and re-established their trade ; but <lb/>that proclamation left the rights of parties, and the <lb/>crimes alleged against the individuals, to be investigated <lb/>and decided upon by the law – and until such investi<lb break="no"/>gation could take place, much uncertainty necessarily <lb/>prevailed from the contradictory statements and affida<lb break="no"/>vits which had been laid before the public.</p>
                <p>The recent trials at York however decided the <lb/>point as to the alleged <hi rend="italic">murders</hi>, and the charge of <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">High Treason</hi>  has never been followed up, nor ever <lb/>mentioned, since it served the desired purpose, by <lb/>figuring in Lord Selkirk's Warrant as a pretext for <lb/>seizing and examining the books and private papers of <lb/>of the North West Company.</p>

               <pb/>Colonial Intelligence. <lb/>Halifax, March 13.</p>
                <p>A very numerous and respectable meeting of the in<lb break="no"/>habitants of this town was held at the Exchange Coffee<lb break="no"/>house, on Saturday last, George Grassie. Esq. to the <lb/>Chair. It was resolved unaminously–That the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature be petitioned to authorise the establishment of a <lb/>bank in Halifax.–That 50,000l be the capital, to be <lb/>invested in the British funds.–That notes to the a<lb break="no"/>mount of 150,000l be issued by the Bank.–That the <lb/>shares be 100l each, and every five shares, according <lb/>to a classification, entitled to a vote.–That the Bank <lb/>be authorised to pay notes presented, either in specie, <lb/>provincial paper, or bills of exchange on London at <lb/>the current rate – A Committee was then appointed to <lb/>prepare the Petition, and cause it to be presetned to <lb/>the Legislature.

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Tex v. The Earl of Selkirk and others</hi>
            </p>
                <p>A bill of indictment, for a conspiracy to ruin the <lb/>trade of the North West Company, and impoverish the <lb/>partnes thereof, was found by the Grand Jury, against <lb/>Thomas Douglas, Early of Selkirk ; J. B. Chevalier de <lb/>Lorimer, Captain in his Majesty's Indian Department ; <lb/>Captain Pratais D'Orsonnens, late of the De Meuron <lb/>Regiment ; Captain Frederick Matthey, ditto ; Lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant G. A. Fauche, ditto ; Lieutenant Frederick <lb/>Graffenrad, ditto ; Serjeant Jacob Vichie, ditto ; Cap<lb break="no"/>tain Miles Macdonnel, late of the Canadian Fecibles ; <lb/>Lieutenant Alexander Bridport Beecher, late of the <lb/>Royal Navy ; Doctor John Allen, John Spencer, Do<lb break="no"/>nald Macpherson, James Chatelain, John M'Nab, Ar<lb break="no"/>chibald Macdonald, and John P. Bourke.</p>
                <p>The indictment contains three counts ; and amongst <lb/>the numerous overt acts therein set forth, support<lb break="no"/>ed by documentary and oral evidence, the following <lb/>were particularly prominent :– The engaging and ar<lb break="no"/>mind a number of disbanded soldiers (foreigners) ; the <lb/>entry of them, by force of arms, into Fort William, <lb/>in August, 1816 ; retaining possession of the fort till <lb/>May 1817 ; sending off as prisoners the partners of <lb/>the North West Company found there ; getting rid of <lb/>the clerks, by subpoenas to appear at York at a period <lb/>when no courts are held there, without ever inquiring <lb/>whether they know anything of the matters to which <lb/>the subpoenas related, and without ever bringing them <lb/>forward afterwards ; stopping of the outfits from going <lb/>into the interior, and the returns from coming into <lb/>Montreal ; possessing themselves of all the books and <lb/>papers of the concern ; sending away the principal <lb/>clerk under a charge of felony, without examination, <lb/>and without having ever followed up the charge ; the <lb/>pretended sale, by Daniel Mackenzie, of the North <lb/>West property, obtained by his Lordship by means of <lb/>continued duress ; tampering with, and debauching the <lb/>North West Company's servants, and commanding <lb/>them in the King's name ; writing circular letters to <lb/>the partners and clerks in the interior country, advis<lb break="no"/>ing them to abandon their trust, alleging that the <lb/>North West Company were ruined, and to carry the <lb/>furs to Hudson's Bay ; taking possession of Fort Lake <lb/>La Pluie, and the property there, and stopping the na<lb break="no"/>vigation, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Upon this being returned a true bill the Attorney<lb break="no"/>General moved the process of the Court against the <lb/>parties ; and Dr Allen being present, was to be ar<lb break="no"/>raigned the following day.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Wm Smith v. The Earl of Selkirk</hi>
            </p>
                <p>This was a civil action brough by Mr Wm Smith <lb/>against Lord Selkirk for false imprisonment.</p>
                <p>It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was under<lb break="no"/>sheriff of the Western District, and as such, the bear<lb break="no"/>er of a writ of restitution founded upon a verdict of a <lb/>special jury at Sandwich, in October 1816, and grant<lb break="no"/>ed by the Magistrate, ordering the restoration of Fort <lb/>William to the North West Company. He was also <lb/>the bearer of a warrant, for felony, issued against his <lb/>Lordship, Dr Allen, Captain Matthey, and others, u<lb break="no"/>pon an information upon oath before a justice of the <lb/>Peace. Mr Smith got to Fort William on the 19th of <lb/>March 1817, and produced his writ of restitution, <lb/>with which his Lordship refused to comply ; and when <lb/>the Earl and others were arrested by Mr Smith, upon <lb/>the warrant for felony, his Lordship laid hold of him <lb/>and pushed him out of doors ; and he was afterwards <lb/>kept in close custody in the fort under a military guard. <lb/>A circumstance which added much to the grievous na<lb break="no"/>ture of the offence, and which was particularly dwelt <lb/>upon by the Judge, in his charge to the Jury, was, that <lb/>whilst Mr Smith was kept in a rigorous confinement, <lb/>Charles de Reinhard, though under an accusation of <lb/>was at large and keeping a school, though no<lb break="no"/>minally under the surveillance of one or two of his for<lb break="no"/>mer comrades. The Chief Justice also remarked upon a<lb break="no"/>nother part of the evidence for the defence, by which <lb/>it appeared that the only option left to Mr Smith to ob<lb break="no"/>tain his liberty was that of abandoning his duty, and <lb/>breaking his oath of office, by a promise not to molest <lb/>Lord Selkirk. Mr Smith, however, notwithstanding <lb/>this proposal, persisted in doing his duty, and was not <lb/>liberated until the evacuation of Fort William by his <lb/>Lordship and his forces in May, 1818.</p>
                <p>The Jury after some deliberation, returned a verdict <lb/>in favour of the plaintiff.– Damages L.500 Halifax <lb/>currency.</p>
                <p>After narrating the military parages, &amp;c. at Rich<lb break="no"/>mond, in America, in honour of the 22d of February, <lb/>a journal says, " A melancholy catastrophe closed the <lb/>day. Colonel W. Tatham, so well known in England <lb/>and this country, for his acquaintance with civil engi<lb break="no"/>neering.–who has been residing in this city for two or <lb/>three years, but whose utility was considerably arrested <lb/>by an unfortunate habit to which he had become ad<lb break="no"/>dicted–was destined on that day to breathe his last.– <lb/>In a moment of intemperance, as he stood by the piece <lb/>of artillery which was firing the evening salute, he ex<lb break="no"/>claimed that he wished to die. As the second gun was <lb/>about to fire, and immediately after the commanding <lb/>had given the word " Fire!" Conolonel Tatham <lb/>presented himself in front of the muzzle of the piece, <lb/>and by its discharge his abdomen was almost literally <lb/>blown to pieces. His body was raised a few feet in the <lb/>air by the explosion, and he fell upon his face without <lb/>uttering one word that was heard by the byestanders.– <lb/>Colonel Tatham died without any family. Circum<lb break="no"/>stances had strip life of much of its attractions in his <lb/>eyes ; but it is impossible not to regard the manner of <lb/>his death with horroer, and to feel the deepest commi<lb break="no"/>seraton for his melancholy fate. He was a man of <lb/>great information, of great genius, and of great re<lb break="no"/>source of mine. But to this melancholy end he has <lb/>arrived."</p>

                <p>Some Canada papers to the 11th let. have arrived in <lb/>town. Sir Peregrine Maitland had summoned the <lb/>Parliament of Upper Canada to meet him at York, on <lb/>the 22d of April. He had appointed Port Talbot in <lb/>the town of Dunwich, a port of entry, in the same <lb/>manner as those established between Canada and the <lb/>United Statess.</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter to a Gentleman in George-town, <lb/>dated Tobago, Feb. 9. 1819.–' The heavy rains <lb/>which continued during the months of December and <lb/>January, almost inundated the country, which brought <lb/>on a most rapid and fatal disease, which made its first <lb/>appearance in the frost, at a short distance from the <lb/>town, consisting of 212 men strong, and in 10 or 12 <lb/>days, 45 of that number were numbered with the dead. <lb/>The contagion was so rapid, that it soon spread into <lb/>the town, shipping, and country, and proved equally <lb/>fatal. The disorder was such, it baffled all medical <lb/>aid. The alarming symptoms were such, that business <lb/>was nearly suspended–the white population seeking <lb/>safety in other islands, or in the remote and healthiest <lb/>part of this. I assure you, that every thing had a <lb/>most gloomy appearance ; and the disease was so con<lb break="no"/>tagious, one man would hardly venture to touch ano<lb break="no"/>ther. The William's crew, from their mutinous dis<lb break="no"/>position, deserted her–some have since died ; and <lb/>some remain sick. The weather has become good <lb/>within these fifteen days, and the health of the island <lb/>improving fast.'</p>
                <p>A series of Sierra Leone Gazettes, to the 20th of <lb/>February, have reached us. They contain no intelli<lb break="no"/>gence of particular interest, expect that the colony ap<lb break="no"/>pears to have been healthy at that period. In one of <lb/>them we find a contradiction of the reports which <lb/>found their way into the English papers some months <lb/>since of the dreadful mortality that prevailed in that <lb/>settlement. It states that the "total number of Euro<lb break="no"/>peans who died in the Peninsula in 1818, was eight <lb/>men, three women, and two children. We lost no ci<lb break="no"/>vil, military or colonial officer, excepting one young <lb/>Gentleman who died a month after his arrival, and is <lb/>included in the number."</p>
                <p>A letter from the Havannah, dated 27th February, <lb/>mentions that the article of coffee is gradually rising <lb/>in value, and that an agent from Messrs Baring is <lb/>making purchases there to the amount of 1/3 a million <lb/>sterling, in that single commodity.</p>

                <p>Advices have been received again from the Cape of <lb/>Good Hope of 6th March, which are several days later <lb/>than those acquired formerly. Of the rising of the <lb/>Caffres there remains no doubt, although it does <lb/>not appear that Government have as yet received of<lb break="no"/>ficial information regarding it. The private accounts <lb/>state that two valuable officers had lost their lives, and <lb/>also a great number of men. The Governor himself <lb/>in order by his presence the sooner to suppress the Caf<lb break="no"/>fres, had, with a competent force, proceeded to the in<lb break="no"/>terior. Great inconvenience was experienced for the <lb/>want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not this <lb/>been the case, it was believed that in a very few days <lb/>tranquility would have been restored.</p>
                <p>We are sorry to state that another hurricane has ta<lb break="no"/>ken place in the Isle of France ; it commenced on the <lb/>25th January, and has done great mischief to the ship<lb break="no"/>ping, and also to the plantations of that ill-fated Is<lb break="no"/>land.</p>
                <p>A Dutch mail has arrived, with papers to the 19th <lb/>inst. At Batavia, two of the leaders of the late distur<lb break="no"/>bances have been tried and execute, and that degree <lb/>of tranquility which terror produces has been restored. <lb/>In the administration of their colonies in the east, the <lb/>conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and op<lb break="no"/>pressive ; and it is to be regretted that the extensive <lb/>and fertile island of Java should have been surrendered <lb/>to their rapacity. During the short time that it was in <lb/>possession of this country, various important improve<lb break="no"/>ments were introduced into its domestic administration ; <lb/>the practise of torture, according to the humane and <lb/>enlightened maxims of British jurisprudence, was abo<lb break="no"/>lished ; new and better modes of collecting the revenue <lb/>were adopted ; and a spirit of mildness and of regard <lb/>for the interests of all the various classes of which the <lb/>population is composed, was evinced, which made the <lb/>British Government highly popular.</p>
                <p>Considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants <lb/>for the safety of the Queen Charlotte, Jamaica packet. <lb/>She sailed from Jamaica the 29th March, and had a <lb/>great quantity of specie on board. No things have <lb/>since been received of her. Several vessels sailed since <lb/>her departure, and have arrived safe. The Ocean quit<lb break="no"/>ted Jamaica on the 6th of April, and arrived here se<lb break="no"/>veral days since.</p>
                <p>Several passengers landed at Portsmouth on Thurs<lb break="no"/>day from Jamaica, bring Port Royal Papers to the <lb/>25th of March. The 50th Regiment had arrived at <lb/>Kingston, from Cork ; and the 2nd West India Regi<lb break="no"/>ment was about to embark for Sierra Leone to be dis<lb break="no"/>banded.</p>

               <pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p>A letter from Corfu, dated the 10th ult. states that <lb/>the Governor of the Ionian Islands, General Mait<lb break="no"/>land, embarked on the 8th inst. for Rome, in order to <lb/>negotitate a Concordat relative to the Romish Clergy <lb/>of the United Islands, as it appeared that Lord Guild<lb break="no"/>ford, who had been charged with the affair by the <lb/>Prince Regent, had failed in his negotiation to that <lb/>effect.</p>
                <p>Previously to the departure of the Governor, a de<lb break="no"/>putation from the Parguinotes emigrants waited upon <lb/>him, to claim the sum to be paid by Ali Pacha, for <lb/>property left in Parga, agreeably to stipulation. Ge<lb break="no"/>neral Maitland assured them he would not depart with<lb break="no"/>out adopting measures in their favour, and immediate<lb break="no"/>ly issued a proclamation, appointing a commission of <lb/>payment. Sir Frederick Adam fills the office of High <lb/>Commissioner, <hi rend="italic">ad interim</hi>, during the absence of the <lb/>Governor.</p>
                <p>Advices from Demerara are received to the 3d ult. <lb/>The following is from the Guiana Chronicle of the <lb/>24th May:–" We observe by St Vincent: papers, <lb/>which we have just received, that the Royal York Ran<lb break="no"/>gers, under the command of Colonel Smelt, had em<lb break="no"/>barked on board the Diadem and Elizabeth transports <lb/>for Canada, where the regiment is intended to be dis<lb break="no"/>banded. It is stated that each of the men will have a <lb/>certain portion of land allotted them in that province <lb/>for cultivation and their future support.</p>
                <p>We have received Newfoundland Papers to the 23d <lb/>ult by which we learn that in the Court of Session, on <lb/>the 18th idem, Capt. Redman, of the brig San Do<lb break="no"/>mingo, from Ross, was ordered to pay a fine of 10l. <lb/>each, for 20 passengers brought in that vessel over and <lb/>above the number allowed by act of Parliament; and a <lb/>further sum of 10l. for not having the regulations re<lb break="no"/>specting passengers posted up in some conspicuous part <lb/>of the vessel ; making in all a fine of 210l.</p>
                <p>We subjoin an extract from the Montreal Herald of <lb/>the 12th June, relative to Mr Gourlay, the celebrated <lb/>reformer:</p>
                <p>From the Niagara Spectator, of the 27th May, <lb/>we find the far famed champion of civil liberty, Mr <lb/>Gourlay, has again made his debut in an address to <lb/>the resident landowners of Upper Canada. This pro<lb break="no"/>duction is of the same stamp as him other lucubrations, <lb/>abounding with strong and vigorous assertions in place <lb/>of facts–a well wove sophistry to beguile the super<lb break="no"/>ficial reader ; and some of the most egregious errors in <lb/>colonial policy recommended with a speciousness well <lb/>calculated to deceive. Having so often stated out dis<lb break="no"/>sent from the political proceeding of this reformer, it <lb/>would be deemed intrusive by many of our readers to <lb/>enter into a refutation of the tenets, or an exposure of <lb/>the absurdities, contained in his address. By others <lb/>we might be supposed as exalting over a prostrate foe. <lb/>Both imputations we utterly disclaim ; while, as men <lb/>we regret that the mad career pursued by Mr Gourlay has <lb/>deprived society of the benefits which might have been <lb/>reaped from his better talents (of which he doubtless <lb/>has a share), we must, as good subjects, feel happy <lb/>that his career has been checked without any bad con<lb break="no"/>sequences to society.</p>
                <p>The following is the present distribution of the for<lb break="no"/>ces in the West Indies:– <lb/>2d Regiment (or Queen's) –Demerara. <lb/>4th Ditto–Head-quarters, Grenada, five companies; <lb/>Trinidad, three companies ; and Tobago, two com<lb break="no"/>panies. <lb/>5th Ditto–Head-quarters, Antigua, five companies ; <lb/>St. Christopher's, four companies ; Montserrat, one <lb/>company. <lb/>9th Ditto–Head-quarters, St Vincent's, five compa<lb break="no"/>nies ; Dominica, three companies ; St Lucia, two com<lb break="no"/>panies. <lb/>21st Ditto (Fusileers)–Barbadoes. <lb/>1st West India Regiment–Head-quarters, Barba<lb break="no"/>does, six companies ; St Lucia, one company ; Domi<lb break="no"/>nica, two companies ; Antigua, one company. <lb/>3rd Ditto–Head-quarters, Trinidad, five companies <lb/>till further orders. <lb/>In Jamaica are the 50th, 58th, 61st, and 92d regi<lb break="no"/>ment. <lb/>In Honduras, five companies of the 2d West India <lb/>regiment.</p>

                <p>The following letter explains, in detail, the degree <lb/>of co-operation which Government proposes to afford to <lb/>those persons who may wish to emigrate from this <lb/>country.</p>
                <p>( <hi rend="smallcaps">Official Circular</hi>.)</p>
                <p>"Downing-street. London, 1819. <lb/>"The sufferings to which many individuals have <lb/>been exposed, who have emigrated to his Majesty's <lb/>foreign possessions, unconnected, and unprovided with <lb/>any capital, or even the means of support, having been <lb/>very afflicting to themselves, and equally burdensome <lb/>to the colonies to which they have proceeded, the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment have determined to confine the application <lb/>of the money recently voted by Address in the House <lb/>of Commons, to those persons who, possessing the <lb/>means, will engage to carry out, at the least, ten able<lb break="no"/>bodied individuals above 18 years of age, with or with<lb break="no"/>out families, the Government always reserving to it<lb break="no"/>self the right of selecting, from the several offers made <lb/>to them, those which may prove, upon examination, to <lb/>be most eligible.</p>
                <p>"In order to give some security to the Government, <lb/>that the persons undertaking to make these establish<lb break="no"/>ments have the means of doing so, every person engag<lb break="no"/>ing to take out the above-mentioned number of per<lb break="no"/>sons or families, shall deposit, at the rate of 10l. (to be <lb/>repaid as hereinafter mentioned) for every family so <lb/>taken out, provided that the family does not consist of <lb/>more than one man, one woman, and two children un<lb break="no"/>der 14 years of age. All children ahove the number <lb/>of two must be paid for, in addition to the deposit <lb/>above-mentioned, in the proportion of 5l. for every per<lb break="no"/>son between the ages of 14 and 18.</p>
                <p>"In consideration of this deposit, a passage shall be <lb/>provided at the expence of Government for the settlers, <lb/>who shall be victualled from the time of their em<lb break="no"/>barkation until the time of their landing in the Colony.</p>
                <p>"A grant of land, under the conditions hereafter spe<lb break="no"/>cified, shall be made to him, at the rate of 100 acres <lb/>for every such person or family whom he so takes out ; <lb/>one-third of the sum advanced to Government on the <lb/>outset, shall be repaid on landing, when the victuall<lb break="no"/>ing at the expense of the Government shall cease. A fur<lb break="no"/>ther proportion of one-third shall be repaid, as soon as <lb/>it shall be certified to the Governor of the Colony that <lb/>the settlers, under the direction of the person taking <lb/>them out, are actually located upon the lands assigned to <lb/>them ; and the remainder at the expiration of three <lb/>months from the date of their location.</p>
                <p>"If any parishes in which there may be a redun<lb break="no"/>dancy of population, shall unite in selecting an intelli<lb break="no"/>gent individual to proceed to the Cape, with settlers <lb/>under his direction, not less in number and of the des<lb break="no"/>cription above-mentioned, and shall advance money in <lb/>the proportion above-mentioned, the Government will <lb/>grant land to such an individual at the rate of 100 <lb/>acres for every head of a family, leaving the parish at <lb/>liberty to make such conditions with the individual, <lb/>or the settlers, as may be calculated to prevent the pa<lb break="no"/>rish becoming again chargeable with the maintenance <lb/>of such settlers, in the event of their return to this <lb/>country.</p>
                <p>"But no offers of this kind will be accepted, unless <lb/>it shall be clear that the persons proposing to become <lb/>settlers shall have distinctly given their consent, and <lb/>that the head of each family is not infirm or incapable of <lb/>work.</p>
                <p>"It is further proposed, that in any case in which <lb/>one hundred families proceed together, and apply for <lb/>leave to carry out with them a minister of their own <lb/>persuasion, Government will, upon their being actually <lb/>located, assign a salary to the minister whom they may <lb/>have selected to accompany them, if he shall be ap<lb break="no"/>proved by the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>"The lands will be granted at a quit rent, to be fix<lb break="no"/>ed, which rent, however, will be remitted for the first <lb/>10 years ; and at the expiration of three years (during <lb/>which the party, and a number of families, in the pro<lb break="no"/>portion of 1 for every 100 acres, must have resided on <lb/>the estate) the land shall be measured at the expense <lb/>of Government and the holder shall obtain, without <lb/>fee, his title thereto, on a perpetual quit rent, not ex<lb break="no"/>ceeding[?] in any case of 2l. sterling for every 100 acres <lb/>subject, however to this clause[?] beyond the usual re<lb break="no"/>servations*–that the land shall become forfeited to <lb/>Government, in case the party shall abandone the es<lb break="no"/>tate, or not bring it into the cultivator within a given <lb/>number of years. I am, <lb/>"Your most obedient servant."</p>
                <p>* The usual reservations are the right of the Crown <lb/>to mines of precious stones, of gold and silver, and to <lb/>make such roads as may be necessary for the conveni<lb break="no"/>ence of the Colony.</p>
                <p>There are already three extensive settlements on the <lb/>South East Coast of Africa, where the finest wheat is <lb/>produced, with little labour, namely Algoa Bay, St. <lb/>Catherine's Bay, and the new settlement on the Kny<lb break="no"/>sua, a considerable river, which is navigable for large <lb/>vessels to the Northward. There are also extensive <lb/>and fertile lands towards Saldanha Bay. As the pro<lb break="no"/>duce from the new colonists will consist of grain and <lb/>as the markets of the Cape of Good Hope, the Isle of <lb/>France, Brazils &amp;c. will in all probability be soon <lb/>overstocked, the settlers will look to the mother coun<lb break="no"/>try for a market, when an unfavourable harvest renders <lb/>the import necessary ; and in anticipation of this event, <lb/>the merchants interested in the Cape trade intend, we <lb/>understand, to make an application to Government <lb/>respecting the Corn Laws, to put the corn from the <lb/>Cape of Good Hope on the same footing as grain from <lb/>the British North American colonies.</p>

                <p>The accounts received on Tuesday from the Cape of <lb/>Good Hope are to the 17th April, which are consi<lb break="no"/>derably later than those previously received.</p>
                <p>Information has just reached Cape Town, that a <lb/>detachment of troops, joined by a number of the inha<lb break="no"/>bitants, who had been sent to suppress the Caffres, had <lb/>succeeded in driving them back, and were compelled to <lb/>cross the river. The corn districts were in a great <lb/>measure cleared of the savages, and the country-people <lb/>were returning to their homes, where they considered <lb/>themselves secure from any further attacks, at least for <lb/>some time to come.</p>
                <p>Letters have just been received, via Calcutta, from <lb/>New South Walves, up to the end of November. The <lb/>colony was then all well, and several convict-ships (the <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">Marley, Glory, Mario, Isabella,</hi>  and others) had ar<lb break="no"/>rived, having made the passage out direct in the short <lb/>period of three months and twenty days, and landed <lb/>all their convicts and passengers in good health. This <lb/>may be considered as another, among many proofs, that <lb/>it is unnecessary to make any stay at any intermediate <lb/>port.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Extract of a letter from Sierra Leone, dated </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">January 9</hi>
            </p>
                <p>"It is with the deepest regret I inform you, that <lb/>notwithstanding the liberality of Great Britain, and the <lb/>faith of treaties solemnly entered into, this coast swarms <lb/>with slave vessels, drugging thousands of its miserable <lb/>inhabitants into endless captivity. A few days ago <lb/>arrived here the Union, of Liverpool : the supercargo <lb/>states, that during his stay in the River Calaba, not less <lb/>than eight vessels, averaging 500 slaves each, had sail<lb break="no"/>ed for the Spanish Collective."</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">" Montreal, May 11</hi>
            </p>
                <p>"We learn there are about 70 souls, mostly Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, preparing to set out from this place, the 25th <lb/>inst. for Lord Selkirk's settlement on the River Rouge. <lb/>The number of settlers there at this time, it is said <lb/>amount to about 590. An intelligent Canadian, in <lb/>easy circumstances with whom we conversed, and who <lb/>goes thither with the before-mentioned settlers, with <lb/>all his family, says he passed a winter there when en<lb break="no"/>gaged in this for trade and reports it to be a fertile <lb/>country, and the climate much milder than that of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada. Thus, there is every appearance, that this Co<lb break="no"/>lony, in the course of time, will become populous and <lb/>flourishing."</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Fire at Newfoundland</hi>
            </p>
                <p>We are sorry to state that another most distressing <lb/>and calamitous fire has taken place at St. John's New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Captain Critchelly, of the alliance, arriv-[?] <lb/>ed at Liverpool from Carbonear, in Newfoundland, [?] <lb/>which he left on the 22d ult. states that a fire broke <lb/>out in an uninhabited house in St. John's between one <lb/>and two o'clock in the morning of the 18th of June <lb/>and that from the inflammable nature of the house[?] <lb/>and more particularly of their roofs, it spread with such <lb/>rapidity, that in the short space of three hours 170 fa-[?] <lb/>milies were burnt out, besides an immense quantity <lb/>of produce consumed in various stores and ware<lb break="no"/>houses.</p>
                <p>We learn from another account, that the fire destroy<lb break="no"/>ed the whole of the old part of the town. It broke out <lb/>near Conder and Tracy's store, and burnt all between <lb/>that and Messrs Baine, Johnson and Co.'s.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Cape of Good Hope</hi>
            </p>
                <p>At the present moment, under the prospect of emi<lb break="no"/>gration, all intelligence coming from this quarter is of <lb/>peculiar interest. The letters which reached town [?] <lb/>Tuesday, mention that the Caffres had commenced [?] <lb/>tilities anew, and that their numbers were very consi<lb break="no"/>derable.</p>
                <p>Cape Town, May 5. <lb/>The Caffres have broken out, and a very serious war <lb/>is carried on at present on the borders. It is said <lb/>that the savages are to the amount of 50,000, and a de<lb break="no"/>tachment of 6000 attacked Graham's Town on Satur<lb break="no"/>day week, about 12 o'clock in the day, but were re<lb break="no"/>pulsed, and 150 left dead on the fiel. They carried <lb/>off 500 wounded. Orders have been issued in every <lb/>district of the colony for the young boors to inrol them<lb break="no"/>selves to oppose the enemy.</p>
                <p>Cape Town, May 16. <lb/>The 13th regiment, commanded by Colonel Wil<lb break="no"/>shire have come up with the main body of Caf<lb break="no"/>fres, near Graham's Town and have defeated them with <lb/>great loss. Since then they have withdrawn from the <lb/>British territory. The 54th regiment arrived at [?] <lb/>place a few days ago from England and have since[?] <lb/>marched off for the frontiers. A large number of in<lb break="no"/>fantry have been mounted on horseback to [?] <lb/>them to pursue more effectually the savages. They are <lb/>all in excellent spirits. It is reported that our present <lb/>Governor is going home, and that another has been ap<lb break="no"/>pointed.</p>
                <p>Jamaica Papers to the 10th ultimo has reached us, <lb/>which confirms the sad accounts of the miserable fate of <lb/>the followers of the fugitive M'Gregor. It appears <lb/>that the schooner Marsha[?] had brought accounts from <lb/>San Blas[?], that M'Gregor, after his disgraceful flight <lb/>from Porto Bello, proceeded[?] in the brig Hero, for St. <lb/>Andreas, where he arrived on the 7th of May, and left <lb/>on the 12th, having suffered considerably from the ef<lb break="no"/>fects of his leap. He promulgated a story that he had <lb/>been betrayed by some of his Officers, who had [?] <lb/>Porto Bello ; but added he would soon receive rein<lb break="no"/>forcements from England, when he would retake it.</p>
                <p>The Blossom arrived on Sunday from the South A<lb break="no"/>merican station, last from Rio Janeiro, whence she <lb/>sailed on the 8th of June. She landed about two mil<lb break="no"/>lions of dollars at Rio Janeiro, from Litna[?] and brought <lb/>to England about 140,000 on merchants' account. She, <lb/>and the Andromache, Captain Shirreff, having [?] <lb/>treasure on board, passed Lord Cochrane's squadron, <lb/>in the South Seas, but his Lordship did not discover <lb/>even the slightest intention of interrupting either of the <lb/>ships. His Lordship's squadron appeared in excellent <lb/>order ; and it is but justice to his Lordship to state, <lb/>that he has not resorted to any undue or improper <lb/>means to man his ships ; but on the contrary in every <lb/>instance of complaint made to him by the mas<lb break="no"/>ters of merchant shipping, of any of their crew having <lb/>deserted to him, he ordered the men to be again in<lb break="no"/>stantly sent on board their respective ships.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to the Cape of Good  <lb/>Hope.  <lb/>(From Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.)</hi>
            </p>
                <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has submitted to <lb/>Parliament the expediency of voting t50,000 towards <lb/>the encouragement of emigration to the Cape of Good <lb/>Hope. Let it be remembered, once for all, that it is <lb/>not because that colony is too thin of inhabitants, but <lb/>that the mother country is too full, that this plan is sug<lb break="no"/>gested. The question is not how you maintain <lb/>a surplus peasantry in the land that gave them birth, <lb/>but, whether you will stop emigration to the frozen <lb/>shores of Canada, and to the United States, or divert <lb/>and encourage it to the finest colony in the world – <lb/>We surely have learnt enough of North America to <lb/>convince us of the degraded and miserable conditions of <lb/>its people. South African, on the other hand, has every <lb/>advantage to repay the sacrifice of quitting the land of <lb/>our forefathers.</p>
                <p>The more fully to understand and appreciate these <lb/>advantages, we shall set before our readers a short view <lb/>of the conditions and facilities of the colony in ques<lb break="no"/>tion.</p>
                <p>The spring, from September to December, is the <lb/>most agreedable season. The summer, from December <lb/>to March, is often intensely hot. The autumn, from <lb/>March to June, is generally fine and pleasant. The <lb/>winter is rainy and stormy, and for the most part so <lb/>cold as to make fires very comfortable during the <lb/>months of July, August, and September. Most of the <lb/>diseases that appear among the natives proceed rather <lb/>from their gross and indolent modes of living, than the <lb/>unheathliness of the climate. The scarcity of water in <lb/>summer is unfavourable to cultivation ; and for want <lb/>of industry or materials this defect is not remedied, as <lb/>it is in India, by artificial tanks or reservoirs. When<lb break="no"/>ever, however, irrigation can be employed, either from <lb/>wells or rivers, the most abundant vegetation ensues. <lb/>Good and abundant water has always been found by <lb/>digging wells in Cape Town and the vicinity. In the <lb/>whole colony there is scarcely a river that can be called <lb/>navigable. Though swollen into torrents during the <lb/>winter, most of them dry up during the summer. All <lb/>the rivers are well stocked with perch, eels and small <lb/>turtle ; and with a certain distance from the coast <lb/>they abound with the several fish peculiar to these seas.</p>
                <p>There is general want of wood in South Africa – <lb/>At the distance, however, of 1.5 miles from Algoa bay <lb/>there is a large forest of a many thousand acres. Some <lb/>of these trees (taxus elongatus) grow to the amazing <lb/>size of 10 feet in diameter, and to the height of 30 or <lb/>40 feet of trunk clear of branches. The wood is use<lb break="no"/>ful for many purposes, but will not bear exposure to <lb/>weather. The iron-wood grows to the size of 3 feet <lb/>in diameter and the trunk straight and very high – <lb/>The Hassayni wood is a beautiful tree...</p>
                <p>The Constantia wine is known throughout Europe, <lb/>and to what perfection the other wines of the colony <lb/>are capable of being brought, may very fairly be au<lb break="no"/>gured for the great improvement that has already ta<lb break="no"/>ken place in its manufacture. Heretofore, the Dutch <lb/>farmer and the merchant have regarded more the quan<lb break="no"/>tity than the quality of their wine. And when a car<lb break="no"/>go was once shipped, it mattered little to them, whe<lb break="no"/>ther sound or sour it reached its destination. Little <lb/>care was taken in the growth of the vine ; the branches <lb/>were permitted to rest upon the groun ; while decay<lb break="no"/>ed and unripe grapes, stalks and leaves, were all pro<lb break="no"/>miscuously thrown in the wine-press. The mode <lb/>also of seasoning the casks with brimstone, and the <lb/>want of good brandy to fit it for foreign markets, have <lb/>all contributed to deteriorate the character and confine <lb/>the sale of Cape Madeira. These defects have lately <lb/>been in a great measure remedied. Proper persons <lb/>have been sent out from Madeira and this country, and <lb/>every care seems now taken to meet and secure the <lb/>growing demand in European markets. The trifling <lb/>duty affixed to Cape Madeira in this country, has been <lb/>the means of introducing it into many families, which <lb/>have hitherto used home-made wines. And though the <lb/>merchants at Madeira have made many remonstrances <lb/>on this preference, it surely is but equitable that en<lb break="no"/>couragement should be given to the stape export of a <lb/>colony, now decidely, and we must trust unalterably, Eng<lb break="no"/>lish. But in addition to wines there are other articles <lb/>of colonial growth, exported to the East Indies, Eu<lb break="no"/>rope, and America. Grain, wool, bides, and skins, <cb/>whale oil and bone, dried fruits, salt provisions, soap <lb/>and candles, aloes, tobacco. Such are the articles of <lb/>commerce that might be turned to the best account. – <lb/>But neither trade nor prosperit of any kind will con<lb break="no"/>tinue to thrive in this colony, under the present mode <lb/>of administering its government and laws. It has been <lb/>said, that despotism would be the best of governments <lb/>were the despot virtuous. This may be ; but conti<lb break="no"/>tuted as human nature is, we fear that the purest a<lb break="no"/>mongst us needs some control. Control, however, <lb/>there is none over the governor at the Cape. He makes <lb/>and annuls laws at pleasure. He inserts a proclama<lb break="no"/>tion in the Cape Gazette, and from that moment <hi rend="italic">his </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">fiat</hi>  becomes the law of the land. He has indeed an <lb/>adviser in the colonial secretary, whose influence does <lb/>not extend beyond that of mere advice. Strange to <lb/>add, the laws at the Cape are at this moment Dutch <lb/>laws, rescinded and obscured by all the edicts of the <lb/>different governors of the colony. All pleadings are <lb/>in writing, and were, till laterly, carried on, <hi rend="italic">foribus </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">clausis</hi>. In 1797 a court of appeal for criminal and <lb/>civil cases was established, over both of which the go<lb break="no"/>vernor presides. In India, in the West Indies, and in <lb/>Canada, there is a governor and a council. These act <lb/>as checks upon each other. But at the Cape there is <lb/>no appeal beyond the governor.</p>
                <p>The taxes, however, at the Cape, under which we <lb/>groan so painfully in this country, are comparatively <lb/>trifling. European luxuries very justly pay a heavy <lb/>import duty, but their purchase is matter of choice.– <lb/>This falls not upon the poor, not consequently will it <lb/>fall upon those most likely to emigrate under the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the Parliamentary grant.</p>
                <p>Noting indeed can be framed with greater care and <lb/>precautions, than the encouragement bedd out in Mr <lb/>Vansittuart's proposal. A small deposit, L. 10. is to be <lb/>made at the colonial office in Downing Street, by each <lb/>individual. A free passage is to be granted, and on <lb/>reaching the Cape, this deposit is to be returned to the <lb/>settler by the local government. And such is the li<lb break="no"/>berality that has guided the proposed plans, it is more<lb break="no"/>over stipulated, that if 100 families should agree to <lb/>emigrate, and their minister with them, not only <lb/>permission will be granted them so to do, but provi<lb break="no"/>sion will be made for him. The separation from coun<lb break="no"/>try and from kindred is thus softened, and it will allay <lb/>many a sorrowing regret and painful recollection that <lb/>in distant lands, and amongst a strange people, the <lb/>settler may still listen to the voice and instruction of a <lb/>pastor, to whom custom, veneration, and affection, have <lb/>all united to attach him.</p>
                <p>It appears that the experiment of a settlement of Eng<lb break="no"/>lish, has already been made upon a limited plan at <lb/>Saldanha Bay (the finest harbour in South Africa) : <lb/>and with such success as to give the best encourage<lb break="no"/>ment to a more extensive emigration. Indeed, from <lb/>what we have outselves seen of the colony and its great <lb/>facilities, we have no doubt whatever of the benefits <lb/>that must arise to the sober, steady exertions of the in<lb break="no"/>dustrious. At the Cape, or elsewhere, poverty and <lb/>misery will attend the vicious and indolent, but <lb/>certain we are, that there is no country under heaven, <lb/>where the poor may find a safer asylum, and where ac<lb break="no"/>tivity, economy and good conduct, will meet with so <lb/>certain and full a reward.</p>
                <p>During the stay of the 93rd regiment of foot (a <lb/>Scotch regiment) at the Cape, many of the privates <lb/>were known to save the whole of their pay, and were <lb/>thus enabled to return to England with a very hand <lb/>some little fortune. English servants of all descrip<lb break="no"/>tions are in great request, and 1.5 sterling a month are <lb/>no uncommon wages for a tolerable cook. It is never<lb break="no"/>theless to beremember, that clothes of all kinds are <lb/>expensive at the Cape, as no manufactory is permitted, <lb/>lest it should injure the trade of this country. Still <lb/>farmers in the country dress very coarsely and cheaply ; <lb/>and their wives and daughters, except on Sunday, are <lb/>humbly clad as themselves. Indeed, in so soft a <lb/>climate as the Cape, there is that occasion for mul<lb break="no"/>tiplicity and warmth of apparel which colder regions <lb/>require. For three-fourths of the year, the best bed is <lb/>a hard mattress with a single coverlet.</p>
                <p>There is point which we cannot pass over ; as <lb/>we think it very intimately connected with the virtue <lb/>and happiness of the settlers. And that is, the educa<lb break="no"/>tion of their children. Nothing is more neglected than <lb/>this in Southern Africa. The boors, (farmers) are <lb/>ignorant to a degree passing credence. With the mi<lb break="no"/>nister that is to accompany 100 families, it would be <lb/>highly expedient to send a few sober intelligent men as <lb/>schoolmasters. Attempts have been lately made to in<lb break="no"/>troduce into the colony the Madras system of instruc<lb break="no"/>tion, and a free school upon that plan has been esta<lb break="no"/>blished at Cape Town, with considerable success. Still <lb/>the natives are stubbornly averse to instruction. Their <lb/>luxurious and bountiful climate supplies them with all <lb/>the necessaries of human life, and beyond this they <lb/>have neither wish nor ambition. But if knowledge has <lb/>its fruits, ignorance has its weeds. The savage and <lb/>unparalleled cruelties that have heretofore been ex<lb break="no"/>ercised towards their slaves and the Hottentot servants <lb/>by these Dutch boors may very fairly be traced to want <lb/>of education, as a main cause. The unjust limits <lb/>shown by the Dutch laws to the <hi rend="italic">white</hi>  man's barbari<lb break="no"/>ties have doubtless encouraged their perpetration – <lb/>Cruelty is not the character of Englishmen, and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, too much care cannot be taken to guard the fa<lb break="no"/>milies of the new settlers against the contagion of the <lb/>inhumanities that they must see practised around them, <lb/>and how far an early and thorough acquaintance with <lb/>our duty to God and man will counteract this influence <lb/>aided a knowledge of common school attainments, <lb/>we need not say. The</p>
                <p>We have thrown these remarks together more as <lb/>loose hints for the consideration of our readers, than <lb/>with any idea of furnishing a complete view of so wide <lb/>and important a subject. We may be induced here<lb break="no"/>after to review the question more in detail. The plan <lb/>itself, as confessed by the Chanceller of the Exchequer, <lb/>has at present assumed a very imperfect shape. Ame<lb break="no"/>rice we have not seen, and can only speak from the <lb/>reports of other. Those reports are sufficiently dis<lb break="no"/>couraging. On the contrary, all who have seen and <lb/>described the Cape, have united in praising it. Food <lb/>is cheap and abundant, the price of labour is exceed<lb break="no"/>ingly high, trade is important and increasing, many <lb/>parts of the colony are beautiful, and its climate is <lb/>mild and healthy. There are few countries upon earth <lb/>where so many components of happiness will be found <lb/>to concentrate.</p>

               <lb/>"Private letters from Panama state, that Lord Co<lb break="no"/>chran had taken Petit Callao[?], in which port a vessel <lb/>was at anchor, having on board 100,000 dollars. It was <lb/>further said that his Lordship has passed Guayaquil <lb/>oh his way to Chili. Almost a forthnight ago, intelli<lb break="no"/>gence reached the Governor of Carthagena, from Santa <lb/>Fe, that General Bolivar, who had been joined by one <lb/>of Murillo's Generals, with a number of troops, was <lb/>making rapid advances towards Santa Fe with upwards <lb/>of 5000 men ; and it was expected the next courier <lb/>would announce[?] the fall of that place. An Aide-de<lb break="no"/>Camp of the Governor of that place arrived at Car<lb break="no"/>thagena at midnight with the above information. A<lb break="no"/>nother account states, that the Venezuelian army, un<lb break="no"/>der General Bolivar in person, had obtained posses<lb break="no"/>sion of Santa Fe, and that his advanced guard was at <lb/>Honda[?] ; he had succeeded in cutting off the retreat of <lb/>General Samana[?], the Captain-General of Santa Fe ; <lb/>his Secretary, Ramirez, has arrived at Carthagena with <lb/>the above intelligence ; it was also added that a part <lb/>of Bolivar's army would soon be in Mempaz[?].</p>
                <p>There have arrived at the port of Quebec, this pre<lb break="no"/>sent season 9,513 settlers.</p>
                <p>A letter from Demerara of the 14th August says <lb/>that a severe shock of an earthquake had been felt in <lb/>that colony for the first time since the memory of man[?]. <lb/>It occurred on the 12th. and continued for 30 se<lb break="no"/>cond[?].</p>

                <p>"Madras, April 17. <lb/>It is with since regret that we announce the death <lb/>of John Duncan, Esq. third Member of the Medical <lb/>Board at this Presidency, at General Lang's gardens. <lb/>On Saturday last, the 10th instant. The funeral took <lb/>place on Sunday evening, with the honours due to his <lb/>rank ; and is remains were attended to the place of <lb/>internment by a numerous assemblage of his friends at <lb/>the Presidency. Mr Duncan's valuable services were <lb/>for mroe than 30 years devoted to the benefit of the <lb/>public, and the relief of suffering humanity[?] ; and dur<lb break="no"/>ing the whole of that period, it may be truly said, that <lb/>he always evinced a firm, humane[?], and honourable dis<lb break="no"/>position, the remembrance of which must render his <lb/>memory universally respected.</p>

                <p>Friday, a Court Martial was assembled on board the <lb/>Queen Charlotte, in Portsmouth harbour, and con<lb break="no"/>tinued by adjournment during Saturday, to inquire into <lb/>the circumstances of the supposed concealment of two <lb/>deserters from the band of the 18th regiment of foot <lb/>on board his Majesty's ships Phaeton[?], Captain W. H. <lb/>Dillon, in the month of October last, when that ship <lb/>was about to proceed to the East Indies; and to try <lb/>Lieutenant John Geary, the first Lieutenant of the said <lb/>ship, for his conduct upon that occasion. The Court[?] <lb/>was crowded with officers, &amp;c. from the shore each <lb/>day. The prosecution was closed on Saturday after<lb break="no"/>nnoon, and the Court adjourned till ten o'clock on Mon<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>day, when Lieutenant Geary made his defence. The <lb/>Court having considered the whole of the evidence, were <lb/>of opinion that the charge was proved, and sentenced <lb/>him to be dismissed his Majesty's ship Phaeton, and <lb/>severely reprimanded.</p>
                <p>Letters from Port Jackson, New South Wales, dated <lb/>March 30th, were receivedon Sunday.

                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Spanish Town, Jamaica</hi> –August 31.</p>
                <p>The mail will convey to you sufficiently afflicting <lb/>news of the voyages which the fever is committing <lb/>amongst us. Part of the 92nd and 50th have made <lb/>their escape on board the Serapis 64, which has been <lb/>roofed to, and most handsomely and humanely given <lb/>up by the Admiral for the use of the troops. The <lb/>loss in men stands about thus: 59th[?], 200[?] ; 92d, 120. <lb/>The 58th and 81st are scattered[?] ; but from all I can <lb/>learn, their loss is not great. The following is a list <lb/>of the officers and their relatives who have fallen vic<lb break="no"/>tims in the course of this month : –</p>
                <p>Lieut.-Colonel Sparrow, Deputy Adjt.-General. <lb/>Lieut.-Colonel [?], 52d regiment. <lb/>Lieut.-Colonel Hill th[?] regiment. <lb/>Major Rowe, 50th regiment, son-in-law of Pay<lb break="no"/>master Montgomery, of the 50th. <lb/>Mrs Rowe, wife of Major Rowe, whom she surviv<lb break="no"/>ed but a few hours, and daughter of Paymaster Mont<lb break="no"/>gomery. <lb/>Major Montgomery, 50th, son of Paymaster Mont<lb break="no"/>gomery. <lb/>Mrs Montgomery, wife of ditto. <lb/>Assistant Surgeon Brown, 50th, son in-law of do. <lb/>Lieut. Richardson, 50th. <lb/>Lieut. North[?], 50th. <lb/>Lieut. and Adjutant Lyon, 50th. <lb/>Two Misses Lyon, daughter of Adjutant Lyon. <lb/>Lieuts. R. M'Donald and George Mackie, 92d. <lb/>Ensign [?] [?]th <lb/>Doctor [?], Medical Staff. <lb/>Captain and Paymaster Turner, 58th. <lb/>The Misses Baxter, daughters of Quarter-Master <lb/>Baxter[?].</p>
                <p>The scenes that have occurred during this awful <lb/>mortality have been most distressing. It has not been <lb/>confined to the military, for the inhabitants have even <lb/>out numbered them.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The Quebec Mercury</hi>  of the [?] gives long extracts <lb/>from the American papers, respecting the [?] of a <lb/>large tract of country by the [?] Indians, to the <lb/>British Government, 2,748,000 acres, stretching from <lb/>the upper part of the midland[?] district towards the lower <lb/>part of the province, in the rear of the old settlements <lb/>on the Ottawa, and not in any manner coming into <lb/>contact with or approach within many miles of the <lb/>boundary of Louisiana. Yet, upon the supposition <lb/>that Great Britain is thus extending her Canadian ter<lb break="no"/>ritory, the American Papers are loud in their invectives <lb/>against this country.</p>
                <p>Letters have been received from Mogadoru[?], dated <lb/>the 28th September, which mention, that the plague <lb/>which had been for some time in the vicinity, had at <lb/>length broken out in that town. We are happy to add <lb/>however, that the deaths at that period were only three <lb/>or four each day, and it was then confined to the <lb/>Moors ; none of the Christians or Jews having fallen <lb/>victims to the pestilence. The weather being extreme<lb break="no"/>ly cold, great hopes were entertained that the further <lb/>progress of the disease would speedily be put a stop to <lb/>when trade, which then at a stand, would renew <lb/>its wanted[?] activity. The whole population of Moga<lb break="no"/>doru is between 10 and 12,000 persons ; by far the <lb/>greater part of whom consider it contrary to their reli<lb break="no"/>gious tenets to use any caution to prevent their taking <lb/>the infection ; and, in the event of their having it <lb/>would not, for the same reason, have recourse to any <lb/>means to counteract it.</p>

               <pb/>India</p>
                <p>We have great pleasure in publishing the following <lb/>interesting letter from India: –</p>
                <p>"Madras, Feb. 4, 1820. <lb/>"I have, thank God, no very brilliant events to <lb/>communicate to you, but if the happiness of man is the <lb/>legitimate object of all Government, it is good to learn <lb/>that British India is at peace, and that a temperate <lb/>and radical reform is gradually going on under the <lb/>Marquess of Hastings' administration. The establish<lb break="no"/>ment of schools, and a free press, are the moving prin<lb break="no"/>ciples by which this great advancement in the state of <lb/>society will be accomplished, unless checked by im<lb break="no"/>pious powers.</p>
                <p>"On the subject of these schools, it is not necessary <lb/>here to dilate. Suffice it to observe, that it is in the <lb/>power of any Government, abitrary or free, to educate <lb/>the great bulk of its subjects, and thereby to advance <lb/>them in knowledge, civilization, and happiness, in <hi rend="italic">the </hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">shortest</hi>  possible period.</p>
                <p>"The establishment of a <hi rend="italic">free press in Asia</hi>  is, in my <lb/>estimation, as useful and magnanimous an art as ever <lb/>adorned the biography of any Statesman. What, say <lb/>its detractors, is setting loose a parcel of printer's devils <lb/>so great an act? No, but setting loose all the intel<lb break="no"/>ligence of the age to work upon the public mind and <lb/>conduct, is an act of unrivalled benevolence. Be it <lb/>asserted that a free press is only applicable to an ad<lb break="no"/>vanced state of society, I deny the position ; it is not <lb/>founded in reason or experience. I contend on the <lb/>other hand, that where least knowledge and msot evil <lb/>exist, there is the greatest scope for improvement ; and <lb/>I offer Scotland as a proof of the efficacy[?] of education <lb/>and a free press.</p>
                <p>"The Marquess of Hastings, Governor General of <lb/>India, has, in the newspapers of Madras and Calcutta, <lb/>been accused of having sent two persons of the name of <lb/>Hastings, to <hi rend="italic">unhealthy</hi>  climates, the one to the East <lb/>and the other to the West Indies, where they <hi rend="italic">died ; </hi>
               <lb/>and for the <hi rend="italic">base</hi>  purpose of securing to his family the <lb/>title of Huntingdon. This, you must be aware, was <lb/>touching his sensitive honour to the quick ; and it <lb/>would seem as if some one inimical to a free press, had <lb/>introduced the paragraph to irritate him. But this <lb/>virtuous man, who would not tread on an insect, al<lb break="no"/>lowed this shameful slander to pass unnoticed. It stood <lb/>refuted in every bosom, and his manly forbearance <lb/>tended but to give further proofs of his attachment to <lb/>our infant liberty. Attacks have likewise been made <lb/>on Sir E. East, our Chief Justice. He complained, <lb/>they say, of these alleged libels to the Chief Magistrate, <lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">who desired him to have recourse to the law</hi>  Conceive <lb/>not, however, that I am the advocate for a licentious <lb/>press. My maxim is, that a great power, when mis<lb break="no"/>chievously applied, must be hurtful, and when well <lb/>applied, beneficial, in proportion to its strength.</p>
                <p>"You will rejoice to learn that Mr Elphinstone, <lb/>Governor of Bombay, has done away with the Censor<lb break="no"/>ship of the Press. This wise Statesman, being a friend <lb/>to freedom, and having <hi rend="italic">experienced</hi>  the benefits which <lb/>had arisen in Bengal from the measure (for scarce a <lb/>day no passes that some abuse is not brought to light <lb/>by the press), adopted it the moment he came into <lb/>power, and thus proved himself a public benefactor.</p>
                <p>"To conclude, it is my firm conviction, that the <lb/>diffusion of knowledge, through the medium of educa<lb break="no"/>tion and a free press, will more than any other mea<lb break="no"/>sure accelerate the improvement and heighten the pros<lb break="no"/>perity, not only of British India, but of the surround<lb break="no"/>ing world."</p>

                <p>A new island has been discovered off Cape Horn, <lb/>in inst. 61 deg. long. 55 deg. by the ship William, on a <lb/>voyage from Monte Video for Valparaiso.

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Proposed New Monarchy in  <lb/>South America</hi>
            </p>
                <p>Accounts have beenreceived from Buenos Ayres, <lb/>by the Blossom sloop of War, of a curious nature.– <lb/>They relate to a project said to have been in agitation for <lb/>placing a Prince of the House of Bourbon at the head <lb/>of an independent Sovereignty on the River Plate.– <lb/>The circumstance has been brought to light by the late <lb/>changes in the Government of Buenos Ayres. From <lb/>the documents now published, and received by the <lb/>Blossom, it appears that in June, 1819. Gomez the <lb/>Envoy from Buenos Ayres, at Paris, was invited to a <lb/>conference by M. De Cazes, then French Minister for <lb/>Foreign Affairs, the object of which was to communi<lb break="no"/>cate a project of the French Cabinet for the colonsolida<lb break="no"/>tion of the Independent Government of South Ame<lb break="no"/>rica.</p>
                <p>This project, the French Minister observed, would <lb/>meet with the decided approbation of the Continental <lb/>Powers, especially Russia and Austria. Great Britain <lb/>might not like it, but yet would not find any good pre<lb break="no"/>tence for resisting it ; and his Catholic Majesty would <lb/>yield to the influence of all Europe with the better <lb/>grace, as his former dependencies would be only trans<lb break="no"/>ferred to a branch of his own family. The King of <lb/>France would furnish assistance of every king, and em<lb break="no"/>ploy every means, even to the supply of troops, for car<lb break="no"/>rying the affair into execution.</p>
                <p>On the 26th of October last, when the statement of <lb/>his conference reached Buenos Ayres, Rondeau, then <lb/>Director <hi rend="italic">ad interim</hi>  made a secret communication to <lb/>the Congress, and transmitted to them the letter of the <lb/>Envoy, together with the French memorial ; on the <lb/>following day, and on the 3d of November, the matter <lb/>was discussed in secret meetings, and the result was an[?] <lb/>opinion, that the Constitution lately-sworn allowed <lb/>no alteration to be made in the form of Government <lb/>till after the meeting of the Chambers. That a branch <lb/>of the Bourbon family, so closely connected with the <lb/>reigning Monarch of Spain, was in itself an insuperable <lb/>objection, as also the consideration that the Prince <lb/>proposed and supported by the Powers of the Euro<lb break="no"/>pean Continent, would naturally more incline towards <lb/>the views of his protectors than towards those of South <lb/>America, which ought to avoid all connexion with Eu<lb break="no"/>ropean continental politics ; and that Great Britain was <lb/>the power from which South America had most to <lb/>fear, and most to expect.</p>
                <p>It was at the same time suggested, that the Envoys in <lb/>Europe shoud put the communications from Paris in<lb break="no"/>to the hands of the British Minstry, whose good opi<lb break="no"/>nion and protection South America is most anxious to <lb/>conciliate.</p>
                <p>Our Cabinet has always treated the South Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans with the greatest reserve, as if feating contamina<lb break="no"/>tion by simple contact–a delicacy towards Spanish in<lb break="no"/>terests and feelings which appears in itself commenda<lb break="no"/>ble, but, when measured by the standard of national <lb/>benefit, may not merit the same praise. As it is, it <lb/>would seem that the British interest is likely to gain <lb/>the ascendacy in the river Plate, rather through the <lb/>disposition of the inhabitants, than from any influence <lb/>exerted by our Ministers.</p>
                <p>We shall only add, that thought the negotiation was <lb/>carried on by the Duke de Cazes, the project did not <lb/>originate with him, and did not at first apply to the <lb/>Prince de Lucca. It was intended as an opening for <lb/>one more nearly allied to the reigning family in <lb/>France.</p>

                <p>We cannot give publicity to the above return, with<lb break="no"/>out observing how eminently calculated such a docu<lb break="no"/>ment is, to open the eyes of our too credulous, yet in<lb break="no"/>dustrious and loyal countrymen ; many of whom are <lb/>still disposed to look to the United Statesm, as the abode <lb/>of independence and the source of affluence. Here we <lb/>see nearly 2000 British subjects, who, in one season, <lb/>through the agency alone of one of our Consuls(with<lb break="no"/>outany pecuniary aid), have removed from the United <lb/>States to Upper Canada. Their trieal and failure in <lb/>the former, as well as the trial and failure of the great <lb/>numbers who have returned to this country, are circum<lb break="no"/>stances well calculated to direct the attention of those <lb/>who have emigration in view, at once to Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>da. We have made enquiry about these hitherto un<lb break="no"/>known, but truly fertile regions ; and we are informed <lb/>from a most authentic and satisfactory source, that there <lb/>there are unlocated lands, fertile beyond the conception of <lb/>those who have not seen them, capable of receiving ten <lb/>millions of inhabitants ; that the winters are not so <lb/>cold, nor the summers so hot, as in the State of New <lb/>York ; that these regions have proved eminently healthy <lb/>to the vast numbers that have poured into them of late <lb/>years ; and that the administration of the laws, the <lb/>state of education and religious instruction, and above <lb/>all, the peace and quiet of the inhabitants have found there, <lb/>have exceed their most sanguine expectations.</p>
                <p>It may be desirable to state, that grown persons can get <lb/>by water from Quebec to York, the capital of Upper <lb/>Canada, for about 28s ; children, half price ; that to <lb/>all persons properly recommended as to good conduct, <lb/>a grant of land is given according to their means of <lb/>cultivation ; that this grant becomes their own for ever, <lb/>and they may dispose of it as they please.</p>

            </p>
                <p>"An opportunity having offered for transmitting <lb/>a hasty account of the Aurora and Brilliant transports, <lb/>proceeding with settlers to the Cape of Good Hope, I <lb/>feel happy in availing myself of that circumstance, <lb/>with a view as well to gratify our friends in England, <lb/>as to add another confirmation of the liberality of Go<lb break="no"/>vernment in our important undertaking. First, it will <lb/>be necessary to state, that the two ships sail in compa<lb break="no"/>ny, and are every day within hail of each other ; the <lb/>former commanded by Captain Pearson, and the latter <lb/>by Captain Bothwell, who is accompanied by Lieute<lb break="no"/>nant Pritchard, as agent to both vessels.</p>
                <p>"We sailed from Gravesend on. Our <lb/>course down Channel was most favourable, and the <lb/>weather has hitherto been propitious. No death, <lb/>disease, or serious accident has occurred in either ship <lb/>and blooming health and vigour now rapidly succeed the <lb/>langour produced by a sudden transition to a new ele<lb break="no"/>ment. Provisions, consisting of flour, currants, suet[?] <lb/>oatmeal, peas, butter, cheese, tea, sugar, biscuit, salt <lb/>pork, and beef, of excellent quality, are liberally sup<lb break="no"/>plied, together with a proper allowance of rum, vine<lb break="no"/>gar, mustard and spices. The ships are fitted up in <lb/>every respect comfortably and commodiously, and the <lb/>most perfect harmony prevails, if we except bickerings <lb/>amongst the old women about fractured teapots and <lb/>mislaid culinary articles. The attention paid to the <lb/>comfort of the passengers, and more especially to that <lb/>of the women and children, by the Captains, and the <lb/>agent (Mr Pritchard), is highly creditable to the in<lb break="no"/>structions received from Government.</p>
                <p>"Although I do not sail in the same ship Cap<lb break="no"/>tain Bothwell. I have had ample proofs of the kind<lb break="no"/>ness and humane liberality which he shews to the pas<lb break="no"/>sengers in the Brilliant. Captain Pearson is an active, <lb/>intelligent officer, who has been 23 years in the Tran<lb break="no"/>sport Service under Government : he has sailed to al<lb break="no"/>most every part of the world, and Algoa Bay, our <lb/>place of destination, is quite familiar to him.</p>
                <p>"It may be egotism to speak of myself; but I trust <lb/>I may be excused in boasting, that of the crew and <lb/>240 passengers, not one is seriously indisposed at present, <lb/>and wishing, with heartfelt sincerity, to my friends in <lb/>England, happiness, peace, and tranquility, in as good <lb/>health as I now enjoy, long may they live, long live the <lb/>Constitution: and while on Fish River or Orange Ri<lb break="no"/>ver we encounter the difficulties incident to new colo<lb break="no"/>nists, may England and South Africa be ever united <lb/>by the ties of mutual friendship–the one affording her <lb/>parental arms, and the other mindful of her filial duty. <lb/>

               <pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p>We have received letters and papers, from the Cape <lb/>of Good Hope, to the 22d October, and they are sa<lb break="no"/>tisfactory in all points of view, but especially with re<lb break="no"/>ference to the new settlement at Algoa Bay. His <lb/>Excellency, the Governor, Sir R. S. Donkin, was <lb/>taking some effectual measures to place the coinage <lb/>of the colony upon a better footing, and on the 13th <lb/>of October he issued a Proclamation for destroying a <lb/>very large quantity of base money. He has also taken <lb/>measure to communicate to the new settlers from <lb/>England the full benefit ofthe Courts of Justice es<lb break="no"/>blished in that quarter of the world.</p>
                <p>We have received an account of the loss of the A<lb break="no"/>beona[?] transport, bound to the Cape of Good Hope, <lb/>with settlers. The following is an extract of a letter <lb/>from the Agent to Lloyd's, dated Lisbon, 20th Dec. <lb/>"The Condessa da Ponte, which arrived on the 20th <lb/>inst. from Marenham[?], has brought 49 persons, who <lb/>escaped from the Abeona transport, bound to the Cape <lb/>of Good Hope, which took fire and was burnt on the <lb/>25th ult. in lat. 5 N. long–and 113 lives were lost. <lb/>The Agent, Lieut. Madge, the Captain, Surgeon, 21 <lb/>men, 16 boys, 4 women, and 5 girls, got into three <lb/>boats, and fortunately fell in with the Condessa da <lb/>Ponte, the morning after the fatal event."</p>
                <p>Demerara Gazettes to a late date have been received, <lb/>which give detailed accounts of the number and state <lb/>of the slaves in that part of the West Indies. The re<lb break="no"/>port is given by James Robertson, Esq. the new Slave <lb/>Registrat of the United Colony. It is a triennial <lb/>statement of the slave population, and the Reporter <lb/>makes some judicious comparative remarks. It ap<lb break="no"/>pears that there has been a large decrease of the num<lb break="no"/>ber by deaths, but the Creoles are greatly increased as <lb/>compared with the former year. Births have been in <lb/>the proportion of one to forty-six. The Report de<lb break="no"/>fends the [?] of the West India Planters, and ob<lb break="no"/>serves that the state of the Black population serves[?] <lb/>to evil for little or no [?] ; so great is the <lb/>kindness, the liberality, and induglent care of pro<lb break="no"/>piertors. It adds, that their own interests is a perpe<lb break="no"/>tual[?] evil[?] upon their humanity. In the colony there <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>slaves on the island, [?] Africans[?] and Creoles <lb/>and there are 38,910 female slaves of the same dono<lb break="no"/>mination, making a total of 76,929. The slave po<lb break="no"/>pulation in 1817, amounted in the whole to 77,867.– <lb/>The number of births which have occurred since that <lb/>period is 5,317, and deaths 7,140. The Report con<lb break="no"/>cludes with some gratifying observations upon the <lb/>flourishing state of the colony.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Success of the Cutch Expedition against the Sindeans </hi>
               <lb/>–The following extract of a letter from Bombay <lb/>bringing this intelligence, we copy from Carrick's <lb/>Post, which appears to have exclusive means of obtain<lb break="no"/>ing information on India affairs:–</p>
                <p>"Bombay, Sept. 12, 1820. <lb/>"While I was seeing the last of your goods on <lb/>board, last night, a vessel arrived in the harbour hav<lb break="no"/>ing on board an officer from Cutch, who was the hear<lb break="no"/>er of the official intelligence of the complete success <lb/>of Sir Charles Culville's expedition against the Sin<lb break="no"/>deans. The expedition consisted of 12,000 men, <lb/>commanded by his Excellency the Commander in <lb/>Chief ; from all I could clean of intellience from the <lb/>followers, it appeared there had been some hard fight<lb break="no"/>ing for five days ; but it ended, as might be anticipat<lb break="no"/>ed, from the imposing force sent against the Sindeans. <lb/>The moment the officer (who is one of the Staff, and <lb/>an Irishman) landed, he set out for the Government <lb/>House, to inform Lady Colville of the event, as it <lb/>must be supposed she was in a state og anxiety, her <lb/>husband being the commander, and her brother, and <lb/>her uncle, Colonel T. Blair, being also on the expe<lb break="no"/>dition. At day-light this morning orders arrived from <lb/>the Government House, to secure a passage and pri<lb break="no"/>vate cabin for the officer in th ship which takes this <lb/>to England, but there was no such accomodation, as <lb/>the cabins were all full ; and as another vessel will not <lb/>sail from thence about ten days, this and will be off <lb/>to-day, the chance is, you will have this letter at least <lb/>six weeks before the officers can reach England with <lb/>the official intelligence. All kinds of European pro<lb break="no"/>duce are a drug hee, paricularly fine goods ; and <lb/>rum, brandy, and geneva, are for a song. The cho<lb break="no"/>lera has rather abated, but still rages in a frightful <lb/>manner."</p>
                <p>The Rio Janeiro packet arrived on Tuesday with let<lb break="no"/>ters to the 21st of November. Advices had been re<lb break="no"/>ceived from Rio Grande, stating that Artigas had been <lb/>taken prisoner. The Portuguese frigate, Union, had <lb/>captured two insurgent privateers which had been com<lb break="no"/>mitting depredations on the coast. The events in Por<lb break="no"/>tugal, owing to which, as well as to the idea that the <lb/>King would be prudent enough to sanction what had <lb/>taken place in Portugal, the prices of produce had ex<lb break="no"/>perienced very trifling alteration, though, if the con<lb break="no"/>trary should be the case, a considerable rise was anti<lb break="no"/>cipated. The following relates to what is passing in <lb/>Peru :–</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter from Rio Janeiro, dated Novem<lb break="no"/>ber 20 :–" The Chilians have at length carried into <lb/>effect their boasted expedition, which left Valparaiso <lb/>on the 21st August, and arrived at Pisco at the begin<lb break="no"/>ning of September. San Martin landed 4,500 men, <lb/>but the blacks, cattle, &amp;c. had all been previously sent <lb/>away from the estates in that quarter, so that they will <lb/>be disappointed in meeting with partisans ; indeed the <lb/>slaves and lower orders, whom they expected to find <lb/>favourable to their views, are the most irritated against <lb/>the insurgents. We have letters from Lima to the 12th <lb/>September, which speaks of the little apprehensions en<lb break="no"/>tertained of San Martin and his troops, the Viceroy <lb/>having a formidable force, in the capital and vicinity, <lb/>of 8,000 men, commanded by good officers. The <lb/>Viceroy, is Commander-in-Chief, La Serna, second, <lb/>and La Mar and O'Reilly command divisions. They <lb/>were observin San Martin's movements who already <lb/>experienced the difficulties of subsisting his men. The <lb/>Marquis of Vallembrozo was on his flank, with a <lb/>strong detachment of cavalry, with a view to prevent <lb/>him from sending emissaries into the interior, and col<lb break="no"/>lecting horses. It is thought the insurgents will soon <lb/>have to re-embark ; for, as soon as they are a little <lb/>pressed for provisions, and fighting comes on, num<lb break="no"/>bers will desert. Those who have already come over <lb/>describe their situation as very critical. Two vessels, <lb/>one an English, and the other a French, were prepar<lb break="no"/>ing to sail from Callao for this place, and by them we <lb/>shall receive further particulars. The most enthusias<lb break="no"/>tic preparations were making in Lima to proclaim the <lb/>constitution in a formal manner, for which purpose <lb/>orders had been received from Madrid. This of itself <lb/>is sufficient to defeat all views Cochrane and San Mar<lb break="no"/>tin may have on the country, except, as before, a lit<lb break="no"/>tle plunder on the open and defenceless parts of the <lb/>coast.</p>
                <p>Letters from Sierra Leone, dated the 24th of Nov. <lb/>mention that the whole squadron was lying there.– <lb/>The Pheasant, Myrmidon, Snapper, and Thistle, were <lb/>lying off the Cape, waiting for the Morgiana to com<lb break="no"/>plete her water, provisions, &amp;c. which ship was oblig<lb break="no"/>ed to be assisted by the squadron, in consequence of <lb/>her very sickly state. She had recently arrived from <lb/>the River Gambia, whither she had proceeded in dread <lb/>of attack by the natives on our infant colony there. <lb/>A letter of thanks had been voted to Captain Finlason, <lb/>by the merchants of that colony, for the very able man<lb break="no"/>ner in which he brought to an amicable conclusion the <lb/>differences between the Native Chiefs and the British <lb/>interests in the Gambia. The Morgania brought from <lb/>the Gambia, Dr Dochard and forty-six men belong<lb break="no"/>ing to the mission under Major Gray, for exploring <lb/>Africa. Dr D. had been at Sago ; but, in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of internal wars, he was unable to proceed <lb/>further. Major Gray was there with very few men ; <lb/>he will not proceed further for some time.</p>

                <p>Sierra Leone Gazettes to the 16th of December have <lb/>been received. It is satisafactory to learn that some <lb/>more effectual measures, than any before adopted by <lb/>the French Government, to prevent slave trading are <lb/>now in a course of execution. The French brig of <lb/>war, Le Huron, of 22 guns, Commodore Du Pres<lb break="no"/>sit, is employed in cruizing for that purpose.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Earthquake at Zante</hi>, Jan. 8.–The last week <lb/>has been a scene of horror and destruction at Zante.– <lb/>At four o'clock, on the morning of the 29th of Dec. <lb/>we had a violent shock of an earthquake, which lasted <lb/>nearly half a minute ; this was followed by eight other <lb/>shocks, between four and six o'clock, which threw <lb/>down one thousand three hundred houses. Providen<lb break="no"/>tially, the first shock did not throw down many, so <lb/>that the inhabitants had time to escape before succeed<lb break="no"/>ing shocks, otherwise theloss would have been dread<lb break="no"/>ful. Only ten lives have been lost, but not a house <lb/>in the town has escaped without some injury. The <lb/>town is still in a complete state of confusion ; one <lb/>thousand give hundred houses more, being so much in<lb break="no"/>jured as to be marked in order to be pulled down ; all <lb/>the steeples in the place must be taken down. The <lb/>streets are almost impassable from the fallen houses ; <lb/>and great caution is required, in walking, to avoid the <lb/>ruins that are still falling.</p>

               <pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p>We have received Canada Papers to the 10th May. <lb/>The active exertions of the Governor to improve the <lb/>inland navigation had given very general satisfaction. <lb/>In the course of the Session of the Colonial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, which was prorogued on the 14th April, no less <lb/>than three Addresses were presented to Earl Dalhou<lb break="no"/>sie, to be forwarded to the King ; one respecting the <lb/>allowance of half-pay to the Militia ; another respect<lb break="no"/>ing the duties imposed in British ports on lumber from <lb/>Canada ; and third related to the losses sustained <lb/>by the people of Canada, during the late war. His <lb/>excellency the Governor had intimated, that no objec<lb break="no"/>tion would be made to the repeal of the grant of 2,500l <lb/>on account of the Civil List for the Colony, provided <lb/>the salaray of the Chief retired Justice, the Receiver<lb break="no"/>General, and that of the Speaker of the House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly, should be continued, in the whole amounting <lb/>to 1,800l. The grant has for some time been a pro<lb break="no"/>minent subject of complaint in the Colonial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment.</p>
                <p>The 37th Regiment for three years stationed in <lb/>Lower Canada is about to leave the Colony for Eng<lb break="no"/>land. The Staff Corps was to proceed to the Otta<lb break="no"/>wa, to carry into effect the intended plan for removing <lb/>the obstructions in that river.</p>
                <p>An article from Montreal, dated May 5, states, that <lb/>a messenger was leaving that place to announce the <lb/>union of the North and Hudson's Bay Compa<lb break="no"/>nies, at their respective establishments. The former <lb/>of these companies was under control of Lord Sel<lb break="no"/>kirk, and the schism that has so long reigned between <lb/>them, with its fatal consequences, is well know to <lb/>the Public.</p>
                <p>By Letters from Bombay we learn that 20 ships <lb/>have been taken up by the vigilant Governor, on board <lb/>of which 5000 troops are embarked, destined to the <lb/>Persian Gulph, to repair the disaster suffered by the <lb/>surprise of the detachment left by Sir Wm. Kier, un<lb break="no"/>der the direction of a young man. The gallant Gen. <lb/>Lionel Smith has been selected for this important ser<lb break="no"/>vice ; and we have no doubt but that he will convince <lb/>the Arabs of the impolicy of their treacherous proceed<lb break="no"/>ings, and justify the high confidence which the Go<lb break="no"/> 
               <lb/>vernment of Bombay have in his talents and valour.– <lb/>His Excellency Mr. Elphinstone, completely recover<lb break="no"/>ed, is gone on a tour to Kutch, to settle all disputes, <lb/>and to ascertain the true situation of the country.– <lb/>How important it is for the Heads of the Presidencies, <lb/>thus to judge from actual observation, instead of trust<lb break="no"/>ing to mere reports. This proves the benefits of ap<lb break="no"/>pointing men of experience and energy in the conduct <lb/>of our Indian Empire–which is now, throuh the <lb/>admirable conduct of the Governor General, and the two <lb/>other Presidencies, in a state of unexampled, tranqui<lb break="no"/>lity and prosperity.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Africa.</hi> –Extract of a Letter from Capt. Colliver, <lb/>a Gentlemen belonging to the county of Cornwall, <lb/>and who is an Officer in the service of the African <lb/>Comapny:–</p>
                <p>Cape Coast Castle, April 21, 1821. <lb/>By the time you have received this, it is probable the <lb/>African Company will have ceased to exist ; we have <lb/>received orders to hold ourselves in readiness to deliver <lb/>up the Forsts and Settlements here to Government. It <lb/>is understood they are to be put on the same footing as <lb/>Sierra Leone. A list has been furnished to Govern<lb break="no"/>ment by the Company's Committee, of their Officers, <lb/>their age, length of service, the situations they fill ; <lb/>their emoluments[?], &amp;c. We have been blockaded here, <lb/>since the 10th of February, by the Ashantees[?] (an Afri<lb break="no"/>can tribe), who have commenced hostilities against us. <lb/>On the day before mentioned, our Governor received <lb/>intelligence that a black man belonging to Cape Coast, <lb/>where the people are under our protection, had been <lb/>cruelly murdered by a Chief of the Fantes[?], at a place <lb/>about six miles from Cape Coast, called Moree[?]. I was <lb/>immediately ordered to assemble all the soldiers I <lb/>could, in five minutes, and proceed to Moree to seize <lb/>the murderer. I quickly set off with four officers and <lb/>85 soliders. A little before we entered the town of <lb/>Moree, where the savages, between 2 and 3,000 in <lb/>number, were assembled, we saw the mangled remains <lb/>of their unforunate victim. The town stands near the <lb/>top of a hill, on the summit of which is an old Dutch <lb/>Fort. As soon as we entered the town, a fire was <lb/>opened upon us ; but as my orders were to seize the <lb/>murderer, if possible, without bloodshed, I did not for <lb/>some time allow the men to return the fire. However, <lb/>perceiving they were resolved to oppose us, I gave di<lb break="no"/>rections to my little party to give them a volley and <lb/>then to charge. The negroes retired as we advanced, <lb/>and in less than an hour we gained the hill, from which <lb/>our opponents fled in every firection. We demanded <lb/>the keys of the fort from the principal man belonging <lb/>to Moree ; who not being engaged in the affair had re<lb break="no"/>mained, and who immediately gave them up. In the <lb/>fort, which has a draw-bridge, we were perfectly se<lb break="no"/>cure from the attack of the negroes. The body we de<lb break="no"/>feated were Fantees, who were assembled to assist the <lb/>Ashantees in enforcing some very unjust demands <lb/>made by them on the people of Cape Coast. As soon <lb/>as the Ashantees, who reside near Cape Coast, learned <lb/>that the Governor had sent an armed force against their <lb/>friends, their drum beat to arms, and they hastened <lb/>after us ; fortunately we had defeated our opponents <lb/>before they arrived. However, they rallied the Fan<lb break="no"/>tees, and took a position about half a mile from the <lb/>town, with a determination to oppose our little party. <lb/>The Governor, apprised of our situation, assembled <lb/>all the forces he could muster, and speedily about 500 <lb/>of the Cape Coast people, headed by our officers, and <lb/>carrying the British flag, were seen approaching. The <lb/>enemy immediatel retired, and we were relieved from <lb/>our disagreeable situation, after having been from nine <lb/>in the morning till four in the afternoon exposed to a <lb/>burning sun, without refreshment. The negroes had <lb/>47 killed, and upwards of 100 wounded in this affair ; <lb/>we had one soldier killed, and four wounded. Since <lb/>the affair, we have not seen one of the Ashantees or the <lb/>Fantees here ; and a total stoppage of trade has taken <lb/>place. We have not learned how the King of Ashan<lb break="no"/>tee intends to act, nor is it safe to venture out of our <lb/>limits, except in large parties.</p>

Any one may live here as well with 500l. as in <lb/>his native land with 5000l. The farming work is still[?] <lb/>done with oxen, which are very fine, and bought at <lb/>3l. each ; cows are 30s. ; and sheep, 6s. a-head (hav<lb break="no"/>ing tails that weight 8lb., a complete lump of fat) ; <lb/>clothes, linen, and all English goods, very dear.– <lb/>Good mechanics, of any description, have very high <lb/>wages. A cargo of Ladies would make a good specu<lb break="no"/>lation, in proceeding to the New Settlement ; for all <lb/>that came out with the settlers have got husbands."</p>
                <p>By letters received from the Cape of Good Hope, <lb/>we understand that the Royal African corps was dis<lb break="no"/>banded there on the 26th of June last.</p>
                <p>By letters from Bombay, dated the 24 of May, <lb/>we learn that the Governor, the Honourable Mr. El<lb break="no"/>phinstone, has returned to the Presidency, after a five <lb/>months' tour to the northward. He must minutely <lb/>examined all the judicial and revenue systems–furnish<lb break="no"/>ing the Collectors and Agents of Government with par<lb break="no"/>ticular instructions for their guidance. He also sent <lb/>out strong detachments to reduce some predatory hordes <lb/>who have long plundered the country, and been a ter<lb break="no"/>ror to the peaceable natives. Those plunderers are <lb/>are called Bheels[?]. They live in the hills and woods, and <lb/>descend in bands to commit their depredations. By <lb/>these letters we learn, what is essential for young men <lb/>going out to India to know, that Writers and Cadets <lb/>now undergo an examination as to their knowledge of <lb/>the native languages ; and no youth has a chance of <lb/>success who is ignorant of the Hindoustanee[?]. The <lb/>highest respect is entertained for the able manner in <lb/>which the disinterested Dr. Gilchrist prepares young <lb/>men for the services. We rejoice to learn that the <lb/>Cholera Morbus has abated its rigour in the Deccan.</p>
                <p>Batavia journals of the 28th April give an account <lb/>of a terrible earthquake which took place on the 29th <lb/>December last, on the south coast of Celebes. It did <lb/>immense damage, especially at Budekomba[?], where <lb/>the sea rose several times to a prodigious height, and <lb/>then falling in with the incredible rapidity, alternately <lb/>deluged and left the shore, destroying all the planta<lb break="no"/>tions from Bontain to Boelekomba[?]. Many hundred <lb/>have lost their lives. The fort of Boelekom-[?] <lb/>ba was much damaged, that of Bontain less so. On <lb/>the 4th of January this year, there was another shock <lb/>of an earthquake, but we do not learn that it did any <lb/>damage. <cb/>It is with much regret we lay before our readers the <lb/>following details of a most calamitous fire which broke <lb/>out at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the 17th ult. :</p>
                <p>" <hi rend="smallcaps">Halifax</hi>, Sept. 17. <lb/>"The conflagration this morning was one of the <lb/>most awful and destructive every witness in Halifax. <lb/>It originated in Sackville-street, in the Bakery occu<lb break="no"/>pied by Shay and Milany, and before it was discover<lb break="no"/>ed, had gained an alarming height. It was near two <lb/>o'clock when the bells were rung. The troops, sea<lb break="no"/>mean of his Majesty's ships, and inhabitants, soon as<lb break="no"/>sembled ; the engines were judiciously placed, lines <lb/>formed to different reservoirs of water, and every exer<lb break="no"/>tion made to extinguish the fire, but we regret to state, <lb/>that before any check could be given to it, the whole <lb/>block of buildings, with the exception of a house situ<lb break="no"/>ated at the corner of Sackville and Blowers'-streets, <lb/>occupied by Mr H. Croskill, the houses occupied by <lb/>Mrs. Neilson and Mr T. Muirhead, on Barrington<lb break="no"/>street, and a stable belonging to J. W. Johnston, Esq. <lb/>in Granville-street, were consumed.</p>
                <p>"For some time great apprehensions were entertain<lb break="no"/>tained that the fire would extend to the houses on the op<lb break="no"/>posite side of the streets, but fortunately it did not. <lb/>Of the property burnt only about t1500 were insured, <lb/>and the calamity has mostly fallen where it will long <lb/>be severely felt–upon windows and orphan children– <lb/>upon industrious tradesmen, whose whole stock of <lb/>worldly wealth was invested in the tenements they oc<lb break="no"/>cupied.</p>
                <p>"To the troops, and the seamen of the ships of war, <lb/>the town is, as usual, greatly indebted for the exertions <lb/>made by them. Twenty-one houses were consumed, <lb/>with other valuable property."</p>
                <p>America appears to be very unhealthy just now– <lb/>The accounts from Long Island, Baltimore, Amelia <lb/>Island, and Norfolk, are extremely calamitous. The <lb/>whole of Amelia Island is a perfect hospital, not one <lb/>family being well, and in many instances not one to <lb/>assist another. So dreadful, indeed, is the disease, <lb/>that there is not one sentinel to do duty. A New <lb/>York Paper of the 30th ult. says–</p>
                <p>We are sorry to perceive from the <hi rend="italic">Franklin Gazette</hi>, <lb/>that the malignant fever continues to make serious ra<lb break="no"/>vages among our fellow citizens at Baltimore. Four <lb/>full victims to it in the 24 hours ending on Sunday <lb/>morning ; and six during the 24 hours ending Monday <lb/>morning.</p>

               <pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p>In our last paper, we gave, from the Jamaiza Ga<lb break="no"/>zettes, an account of the dreadful drought which had <lb/>prevailed in that island for more than twelve months <lb/>and the consequences of which had been most calami<lb break="no"/>tous. We are now, however, most happy, in being <lb/>able to state, upon the authority of a Gentleman who <lb/>left Jamaica some days subsequently to the date of our <lb/>preceding advices, that this terible evil, in such a cli<lb break="no"/>mate particularly, had at length ceased. The follow<lb break="no"/>ing is the substance of the information which has been <lb/>communicated to us:–</p>
                <p>"A few hours previous to my going on board the <lb/>Jamaica packet, on the 3d of September, the rain fell <lb/>in such torrents as to flood the streets of Kingston to <lb/>the depth of two feet, and it seemed to be general <lb/>throughout the district of Liguanea.</p>
                <p>"Though too late to save the crop of sugar for the <lb/>present, or, perhaps, the ensuing year, this seasonable <lb/>change of weather would at least have the effect of <lb/>staying the mortality among the cattle. As such, those <lb/>interested in the island will receive the intelligence <lb/>with gratification. On some properties, the canes had <lb/>been cut as fodder to save the stock."</p>
                <p>We have the Cape of Good Hope papers to the 6th Au<lb break="no"/>gust, and as they are unusually barren in their con<lb break="no"/>tents, it is fair to infer that every thing was proceeding <lb/>there in a satisfactory manner. The only article of <lb/>the slightest interest relates to the change the Governor <lb/>is gradually effecting in the currency, by removing <lb/>from it all the base metal, and substituting gold and <lb/>silver of standard value.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gazette of Dordrecht</hi>  publishes accounts from <lb/>Java to the 29th May. They confirm the statement of <lb/>the decrease of the malady, and mention, that it was <lb/>almost wholly subdued in the district of Samarang, <lb/>but that 18,000 persons, mostly Europeans, had fal<lb break="no"/>len victims. Batavia and Sourabaya were still in<lb break="no"/>fected.</p>
                <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">India</hi> –Extract of a letter from Calcutta, dated <lb/>June 20:–</p>
                <p>"If the extension of foreign trading be considered with <lb/>you as a means suited to alleviate the pressure, and ease <lb/>the difficulties of Old England, which we read of here, <lb/>we imagine that India can furnish beneficial openings to <lb/>this kind of remedy. The use of articles of British pro<lb break="no"/>duction and exports is gaining ground rapidly here ; the <lb/>English printed cottons are now carried in considerable <lb/>quantities as far as Rajpootha, and find a ready sale, if <lb/>they be of handsome patterns. The warehouses now are <lb/>so far from being overstocked, that before the arrival of <lb/>two vessels from England in the last fortnight, all Euro<lb break="no"/>pean articles were exorbitantly high ; mustard flour sold <lb/>about 20s. a pound ; cheese 1[?] ; ham, three half crowns <lb/>the ld ; a common round hat, three guineas. These, <lb/>undoubtedly, were prices arising from an unusual scarci<lb break="no"/>ty ; but it surely cannot be so very bad a trading, <lb/>which admits, even, indicidentally, of such an exaggera<lb break="no"/>tion of price and profit. Government bonds are now at <lb/>six per cent premium, though they bear but half the <lb/>usual or legal interest of the country. This is a tolerable <lb/>evidence of the credit of the Company and the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. There is a great and increasing prosperity in Hin<lb break="no"/>dostan. The augmented cultivation of the Upper Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces within these two years is surprising.</p>

                <p>By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler, and <lb/>part of the crew of the India brig Matilda, which sailed from <lb/>this Colony in August 1813, bound on a voyage to the Derwent <lb/>and Eastern Islands, and from thence to China; but was cut off <lb/>and plundered on the night of the 10th of April last, while lying <lb/>at anchor in Duff's Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah, one of the <lb/>Marquessas, on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poo<lb break="no"/>mootoo men) had previously deserted, and joining with some of <lb/>the Rooapoah natives, took the opportunity of a dark night, and <lb/>the wind blowing fresh right on the land, to cut the vessel adrift; <lb/>by which means she drove ashore through a heavy surf, and was <lb/>soon bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives <lb/>saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat, they con<lb break="no"/>curred universally in the design of putting the whole of her crew <lb/>to death; which appears to have been a constant practise among <lb/>the different natives towards one another, when their canoes hap<lb break="no"/>pen to fall upon a strange land, through stress of weather, or from <lb/>any other accident.</p>
                <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their Chief, or <lb/>King, Nooahetu, who presided at the horrible tribunal that had <lb/>devoted the unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter. He with<lb break="no"/>held his assent to the murder; but had no hesitation in permit<lb break="no"/>ting the plunder of the vessel. The crew were informed by such <lb/>expressions as they could understand, as well as by the gesticula<lb break="no"/>tions that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion, <lb/>that their lives were dependent on the issue; the good Chief <lb/>was opposed by many other Chiefs, who, though somewhat in<lb break="no"/>ferior in rank, were very far superior in number, supported by <lb/>the common usages of the island, from which the exhibition of <lb/>clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated, <lb/>with his son by his side, on a mat in his own dwelling; he had <lb/>been called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish of <lb/>the people, as it was not a hereditary right, but an elective dig<lb break="no"/>nity. His people pressed their solicitations earnestly , and at <lb/>length peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he <lb/>for a length of time opposed by the force of words, which not <lb/>seeming likely to prevail, he adopted a method which silenced <lb/>the whole in an instant, and saved the lives of Captain Fowler <lb/>and his crew. Finding that all his expostulations were defeated, <lb/>on the principle of undeviating custom, he deliberately took <lb/>up two ropes that were near him, and fixing one round the neck <lb/>of his son, and the other round his own, called to the Chief next <lb/>in command, who immediately approached him. His conference <lb/>was short and decisive–he first pointed to the cord that encircled <lb/>the neck of his son, and then to the other which he had entwined <lb/>round his own. "These strangers are doomed to death," said <lb/>he, "by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit that I, who <lb/>am their King, should live to see so vile a deed perpetrated.– <lb/>Let my child and myself be strangled before it is performed; and <lb/>then it never will be said that we sanctioned, even with our eye<lb break="no"/>sight, the destruction of these unoffending people."</p>
                <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than <lb/>produce, even in the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm <lb/>of surprise, mingled with a sentiment of admiration, in which the <lb/>untaught man may possibly excel his fellow-creature, whose con<lb break="no"/>ceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the <lb/>extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly <lb/>upon their King, whose person they adored, because that his <lb/>principles were good, and his government just and mild. They <lb/>saw the obedient Chief, to whom the order of strangulation had <lb/>been imparted, staring with horror and amazement at the change <lb/>which a few moments had produced; the mandate, which had <lb/>proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed; and, com<lb break="no"/>manded to perform the dreadful office, he proceeded to obey– <lb/>when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbear<lb break="no"/>ance. "The King! the King!" from every lip burst forth– <lb/>'What! kill the King! No, no, let all the strangers live–no <lb/>man shall kill the King!" Thus were their lives preserved, and <lb/>the vessel plundered of every thing on board her.</p>
                <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Nooaheva, <lb/>still remains, and is dry at low water. All her iron and copper <lb/>have been taken out by the natives, who have a thorough know<lb break="no"/>ledge of the use of these materials. That they are cannibals is <lb/>well ascertained. They form distinct factions, and make war <lb/>upon the ruling Chief. The rebels are denominated the Typees; <lb/>and the opposite parties are horribly sanguinary towards each.– <lb/>Six of the adverse party were killed and devoured by the re<lb break="no"/>bels while Captain Fowler was among them, and the following <lb/>detestable circumstance occurred on the occasion:–A native <lb/>man belonging to Port Anna Maria, who was not tattooed, and <lb/>in consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh, on pain <lb/>of death, impatient of the restraint, fell upon one of the murder<lb break="no"/>ed bodies, and darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a <lb/>voracious fury, exhaled the crimson moisture, which had not yet <lb/>coagulated.</p>
